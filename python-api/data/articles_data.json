        "content": "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.\n\nFor now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong — a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.\n\nThat's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.\n\nWhile the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.\n\n“We’re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.\n\nIf Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers — Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.\n\nThe growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.\n\nThat has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up. Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.\n\nWaymo's early lead in the still-nascent robotaxi market is a vindication of a technology that began as a secret project within Google in 2009 before it was spun off into a separate company owned by Alphabet Inc. in 2016.",

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth lambasted Biden for \"flippantly\" mishandling classified documents and suggested that if he had behaved similarly, he would have expected to be \"court-martialed.\"\n\nThe condemnatory language these senior administration officials have used about prior breaches of protocol in handling sensitive materials adds a layer of irony to what experts are calling an unconscionable misuse of classified information.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former national security official in both Republican and Democratic administrations, said, \"from a security perspective, there is no scenario that justifies this type of information being discussed over a non-government controlled communication platform.\"\n\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth talk as President Donald Trump meets French President Emmanuel Macron in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Feb. 24, 2025. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\n\"Communicating sensitive, operational information in this manner increases the likelihood of inappropriate disclosure which places military personnel at risk,\" said Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor. \"There will also be questions about whether doing so violated statutes governing the safeguarding and retention of government information.\"\n\nMore recently, many of these senior administration officials had much to say about the yearlong investigation into Biden's handling of classified materials. The investigation did not result in any charges.\n\nIn January 2023, Hegseth, than a \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, appeared on Fox News and called Biden's actions \"nefarious, sloppy and dumb.\"\n\n\"If the top man in the job was handling classified documents this flippantly for that long, why was that the case? Was it really that he didn't know? When you take something out of the SCIF [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] if you're a senator, you know exactly what you're doing. You had to sneak it out,\" he said. The report included photos of boxes, including one damaged one that contained classified materials, including documents about Afghanistan that was found in the garage of Biden's home in Delaware \"near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket, a broken lamp wrapped with duct tape, potting soil, and synthetic firewood.\"\n\nIn January 2023, Rubio, also appeared on Fox News, where he said, \"Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting -- it's a problem, I don't care who did it.\"\n\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton drew controversy by using a private email server for official public communications rather than using official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. The way many officials reacted has come back to haunt them.\n\nIn 2016, Hegseth told Fox News, \"If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now... because the assumption is in the intelligence community, if you are using unclassified means, there is likelihood that foreign governments are targeting those accounts.\"\n\nReacting to a Politico article on Clinton, Waltz, who apparently added Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, to the Signal chat, criticized the Department of Justice for its handling of the situation.\n\n\"Biden's sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton's private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,\" Waltz said.\n\nIn January 2016, Rubio also appeared on Fox News, demanding that Clinton to be held accountable.\n\n\"Nobody is above the law … people are going to be accountable if they broke the laws of this country,\" he said.\n\nIn August 2022 Stephen Miller, now Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy who was also in the Signal chat group, also posted his thoughts on X reacting to the Clinton email scandal.\n\n\"One point that doesn't get made enough about Hillary's unsecure server illegally used to conduct state business (obviously created to hide the Clintons' corrupt pay-for-play): foreign adversaries could easily hack classified ops & intel in real time from other sides of the globe,\" he said.\n\nOnly two weeks ago, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced a crackdown on leaks within the intelligence community.\n\n\"Any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such,\" she said in a press release.",

The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,\" Hughes said in the statement.\n\nThe revelation sparked outrage and disbelief, including from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was dogged by criticism of her use of a private email server while at the State Department in the days before the 2016 presidential election that she lost to Trump.\n\n“You have got to be kidding me,” Clinton posted on X.\n\nSecretary of Defense Peter Hegseth listens as President Donald Trump delivers remarks in the Oval Office of the White House, Mar. 21, 2025 in Washington. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nHegseth disputed Goldberg's description of the chat late Monday.\n\n“I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said shortly after landing for a layover in Hawaii on a trip to Asia.\n\nHegseth criticized Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again, to include the, I don't know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides, hopes, or suckers and losers.”\n\n“This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,” he added.\n\nAsked about the incident, President Donald Trump said he \"doesn't know anything about it,\" and later added that he was hearing about it for the first time from the reporter who asked the question.\n\nTrump later appeared to mock the story, reposting on his Truth Social platform a post by his adviser Elon Musk on X that read, \"Best place to hide a dead body is Page 2 of The Atlantic magazine, because no one ever goes there\"\n\nGoldberg told ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis that he initially responded to a request to connect by someone purporting to be Waltz and later, as the user identified as Waltz put together as other a group chat with other high-ranking White House officials to discuss military action in Yemen, that someone was \"running a hoax\" on him.\n\n\"And the main reason I thought that actually, was that it seemed completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting, you know, on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also sort of invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation,\" he said.\n\n\"And then when the attack seems to be going well, they start sharing congratulatory texts, including emojis, fist emojis, fire emojis, American flag emojis with each other. And so that was that was the that was the day that I realized, 'Oh, this is possibly unbelievably, the leaders of the United States discussing this on on my messaging app,\" he said.\n\nAsked for his reaction when he realized that the chat was real, Goldberg said, \"Honestly, my reaction was, 'I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system,' which is to say, it's almost automatically true that if the editor in chief of The Atlantic is being given access to this kind of information, weapon systems and packages and timing and weather in Yemen and all kinds of information about sequencing of particular events, then obviously there's a security breach.\"\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions about Hegseth's participation in the Signal discussion and the sharing of attack plans to the National Security Council and the White House.\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce was asked about the Atlantic's report -- including why members of the Cabinet were having a classified conversation over Signal and whether Rubio was concerned about the implications of the incident.\n\n\"Well, I have two very short things to say to you: First is that we will not comment on the secretary's deliberative conversations, and secondly, that you should contact the White House,\" Bruce responded.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, \"The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous.\"\n\n\"If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,\" Reed said. \"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line.\"\n\nOther congressional Democrats expressed incredulity and called for investigations.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the incident \"reckless, irresponsible and dangerous.\"\n\n\"These people are incredibly unqualified, irresponsible, and they're jeopardizing America's national security,\" he said of Trump's administration.\n\n\"This whole Trump administration is filled with lackeys and incompetent cronies. I'm not talking about any particular individual, though,\" he added. \"I will note that the secretary of defense who was on that chain has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history. Think about that.\"\n\nIn a statement later Monday, Jeffries as a little more blunt in his criticism of the secretary of defense.\n\n“It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,” Jeffries said.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Republicans to work with Democrats on a \"full investigation\" into the incident.\n\n\"Mr. President, this is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"This kind of carelessness is how people get killed. It's how our enemies can take advantage of us. It's how our national security falls into danger.\"\n\nIllinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel, posted on X: Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat...Hegseth and Trump are making our country less safe.\"\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons said the participants in the chat had \"committed a crime -- even if accidentally\" and added, \"We can't trust anyone in this dangerous administration to keep Americans safe.\"\n\nArizona Sen. Ruben Gallego called the episode \"Amateur hour.\"\n\n\"These are the genuises [sic] that are also selling out Ukraine and destroying our alliances all around the world,\" he added. \"No wonder Putin is embarrassing them at the negotiation table.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson downplayed the incident, saying, \"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nPushed if conducting such a discussion on on a third-party app was irresponsible, Johnson replied, \"Look, I'm not going to characterize what happened. I think the administration has acknowledged it was a mistake, and they'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again. I don't know what else you can say.\"\n\nJohnson added he doesn’t believe Waltz or Hegseth should be disciplined.\n\n-ABC News' Luis Martinez, Shannon K.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.\n\nShe was 49.\n\nLove's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.\n\nShe had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University’s brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nLove died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.\n\n“With grateful hearts filled to overflowing for the profound influence of Mia on our lives, we want you to know that she passed away peacefully,” her family said. “We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences.\"\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox referred to Love as a “true friend.”\n\n“Her legacy of service inspired all who knew her,” Cox said in a statement. “We pray for her family and mourn with them.”\n\nLove entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, a growing community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She later became the city’s mayor.\n\nIn 2012, Love narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Jim Matheson, in a district that covers a string of Salt Lake City suburbs.\n\nShe ran again two years later and defeated first-time candidate Doug Owens by about 7,500 votes.\n\nLove didn’t emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn’t win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.\n\nShe was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from Donald Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters, while he was running for president ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2016, facing reelection and following the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump made lewd comments about groping women, Love skipped the Republican National Convention and released a statement saying definitively that she would not vote for Trump. She instead endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP race, but he dropped out months later.\n\nWhile seeking a third term in 2018, Love tried to separate herself Trump on trade and immigration while still backing her party's positions on tax cuts. Despite Republican voters outnumbering Democrats by a nearly three-to-one margin in her district, though, she lost by fewer than 700 votes to former Salt Lake City Mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat.\n\nTrump called out Love by name in a news conference the morning after she lost, where he also bashed other Republicans who didn’t fully embrace him.\n\n“Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,” Trump said. “Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.”\n\nAfter her loss, Love served as a political commentator on CNN and as a fellow at the University of Sydney.\n\nFollowing Trump’s election in November, Love said she was “OK with the outcome.”\n\n“Yes, Trump says a lot of inconsiderate things that are unfortunate and impossible to defend. However, his policies have a high probability of benefiting all Americans,” Love wrote in a social media post.",

However, for Dallas woman Laura Grillo, there would be no wedding, no honeymoon and no future.\n\nUrged by her best friend, Heather Nabor, and maid of honor, Grillo followed the ritual in the bridal salon, ringing a handbell when she selected her dress.\n\n\"I remember we finally picked out her dress and that perfect outfit for the perfect day,\" Nabor told \"20/20\" \"Making the wish, ringing the bell, I kinda talked her into it. I'm glad I did that.\"\n\nShe never got to wear it -- just a week before her big day, around noon on Nov. 13, 2015, she was found lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor.\n\nLaura Grillo was just eight days away from walking down the aisle when she was murdered. Diane Graef\n\nWhen officers and emergency service workers arrived, they discovered Grillo dead. A shell casing was found on the floor -- Grillo had been shot.\n\n\"Inside the master bedroom there was a safe on the dresser, the door was open, and there was two plastic totes that were turned over on the bed,\" Detective Jeff Freeman, who worked on the case, told \"20/20.\" \"It didn't look as far as burglary that was interrupted or anything like that. It just didn't look right to me.\"\n\nSince Grillo's fiancé, John Makris, was captured on surveillance video at a Home Depot store across town at the time she was killed, after interviewing him police determined he couldn’t have killed her.\n\nNonetheless, his behavior following Grillo's death raised questions.\n\nLaura Grillo is seen with her fiancé. John Makris. Liz Frogge\n\nOriginally from Greece, Makris was a contractor.\n\nDetectives recalled what Makris said at the scene when they asked him who lived in the house -- before he was told that Grillo had died.\n\n\"He stated that it was him, the kids, his mother and the victim's brother,\" Freeman said. \"But he never did say the victim's name. That was a huge red flag. Because maybe he knew a lot more of what was going on.\"\n\nAfter finding out that the wedding flowers were non-refundable, Laura’s best friend says he repurposed them for the funeral, and asked a neighbor to help scrub Grillo's blood off the kitchen floor using Grillo's own toothbrush.\n\nJesus Treviño, one of two employees seen with Makris on the morning Grillo was attacked, was questioned by investigators -- and disappeared.\n\nTreviño was ultimately located in the Clearwater, Florida, area and taken into custody by U.S. Marshals. Treviño refused to talk, so investigators turned to Makris' other employee seen with Makris the morning of the murder, James Vileda.\n\nDuring a four-hour interview, he gave a troubling account of a plot, a crime and a cover-up.\n\nHeather Nabor speaks with ABC News’ John Quiñones about the loss of her best friend, Laura Grillo. ABC News\n\nHe told police he received a call from Treviño -- an old friend -- about a new job. Vileda said that the conversation quickly shifted from working on a construction job to becoming an accomplice in a murder.\n\nVileda claimed that Grillo's death was not a robbery gone wrong. He said it was a murder for hire, orchestrated by the man Laura Grillo was just days away from marrying --her fiancé, Makris.\n\nIn September 2018, Makris was convicted on a murder-for-hire charge and sentenced to life in prison. Treviño was convicted of capital murder and received a life sentence, while Villeda pleaded guilty to murder in exchange for his testimony and got a 25-year sentence.\n\nFrom prison, Makris tried to have custody of their daughter awarded to his mother, so she could raise her in Greece. He did not succeed, and she was adopted by Grillo’s best friend Nabor -- the woman who would have been her maid of honor.\n\nABC News reached out to Makris at the Texas prison where he is serving his life sentence, but he declined our request for an interview.\n\nABC News' \"20/20\" limited true crime series \"Bad Romance\" is back for an all-new second season of eight episodes. Kicking off the season is “No Tomorrow,” the all-new story of Laura Grillo, a young bride-to-be in Rowlett, Texas, whose life was tragically cut short.\n\nYou can watch more details and hear exclusive interviews from attorneys, family members, and police involved in this case on ABC on Tuesday, March 25 at 10 p.m. streaming the next day on Hulu.",

The administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said.\n\nA customer shops for eggs at a grocery store on March 12, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe news of a potentially softer approach to forthcoming tariffs rallied U.S. stocks on Monday, recovering some of the losses suffered earlier this month. The major stock indexes moved slightly higher in early trading on Tuesday.\n\nConsumer sentiment appears to align with dampening expectations at the Federal Reserve. Last week, the Fed predicted weaker year-end economic growth and higher inflation than it had in a December forecast.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell faulted tariffs for a \"good part\" of recent inflation.\n\nBy some key measures, however, the economy remains in solid shape. A recent jobs report showed steady hiring last month and a historically low unemployment rate. Inflation stands well below a peak attained in 2022, though price increases register nearly a percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of 2%.\n\nStill, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as businesses and consumers weather the trade war. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 15% to 20%. Moody's Analytics pegged the chances of a recession over the next year at 35%.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, could weaken if shopper sentiment sours, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, told ABC News in a statement.\n\n\"A cut-back in spending has the potential to reverberate throughout the economy,\" Kenwell said.",

        "content": "The case could have potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday grappled with whether or not to send Louisiana legislators back to the drawing board in a high-stakes dispute over the Voting Rights Act and an election map with two majority-black U.S. congressional districts -- which the state's Republican leaders want to keep.\n\nThe state's current map, which was used in the 2024 election, was drawn after two lower courts found an earlier version with only one majority-black district had violated Section 2 of the VRA by disenfranchising minority voters, who make up more than a third of the state's population. The layout of Louisiana's congressional districts could have potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"We'd rather not be back at this podium defending a new map this fall,\" Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga told the justices on Monday.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Washington, June 30, 2024. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nAguinaga said the state was happy with the ultimate layout of six congressional districts -- four of which are held by Republicans, two by Democrats -- because it protected key Republican incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We're in the business of complying with federal court decisions,\" Aguinaga said. \"When they said 'draw a second majority-black,' that's what we did.\"\n\nWelcome to Louisiana sign. Grandriver/Getty Images\n\nA group of non-black voters sued the state, alleging the Louisiana legislator's use of race to draw a second majority-black district -- as ordered by the courts -- violated the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, which ensures that everyone is treated equally under the law. They won a favorable decision from a different district court, which wants the state to start over again.\n\nMuch of the oral argument in the case, Louisiana v. Callais, focused on how a state was supposed to comply with competing demands from the law -- balancing respect for the VRA and rights of minority voters with the command from the Constitution that treatment of Americans be race-blind.\n\nThe Supreme Court has previously given states significant breathing room to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Its rulings have also said race cannot \"predominate\" as a factor in how election maps are drawn, but that politics is a permissible factor.\n\nSeveral justices indicated that Louisiana's map should stand precisely because it was following court orders.\n\n\"Having a likely Voting Rights Act violation [as the two lower courts initially found], you don't need to engage in the thought process of what if the court order is wrong,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It seems to me Louisiana had to follow it.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito suggested the high court should scrutinize the lower court mandates that the state create a second majority-black district in the first place. He voiced skepticism that it was necessary.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, frequently a swing vote in close cases, suggested that he believes the use of race in any map drawing should have an expiration date.\n\n\"In our Equal Protection law, the court has said race-based remedial action must have an end point,\" Kavanaugh said. \"How does that apply to Section 2 [of the Voting Rights Act]?\"\n\nThe decision in the case could have consequences for who controls power in Washington.\n\nRepublicans have a razor-thin majority in the House, which means every single seat could be key to the balance of power after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nA decision is expected by the end of June.",

(Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group via AP, Pool, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Former UFC champion Cain Velasquez was sentenced to five years in prison Monday for a shooting in 2022 where he chased after the man accused of molesting his son.\n\nVelasquez was sentenced in Santa Clara County after he pled no contest to attempted murder, felony assault, and other related gun charges last August for what the district attorney's office called a “vigilante shooting spree.” He will receive credit for time served.\n\nIn February 2022, the two-time UFC heavyweight champion fired a gun multiple times at a truck carrying three people, including 46-year-old Harry Goularte, who is facing felony child molestation charges, according to the district attorney's office.\n\nHis defense attorney, Renee Hessling, called the result “bittersweet” as they had hoped to keep Velasquez out of prison.\n\n“Throughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. “He has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.”\n\nLess than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.\n\nVelasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney’s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.\n\nVelasquez has said the sexual assault incident involved his child and is suing Goularte and his family’s daycare for negligence and sexual battery.\n\nOn his former teammate Kyle Kingsbury's podcast, Velasquez said the way he handled the situation was “not the way to do it.”\n\n“We cannot put the law in our own hands,\" Velasquez said. \"I know what I did, and I know what I did was very dangerous to other people, you know? Not just to people involved, but innocent people. I understand what I did and I’m willing to do everything I have to, to pay that back.”\n\nVelasquez also said it was important to have open and honest with your kids about what kind of behavior is acceptable and listen to what they say.\n\n“One man’s decision to take the law into his own hands left an innocent man wounded and endangered schoolchildren, teachers, and many others in our community,\" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. \"If you want to do justice in Santa Clara County, please apply for a badge.”",

Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAsked who she will go after, she said, “We'll see when I get in there.”\n\nPressed on whether she would go after politicians, she shot back that the media would “love that narrative.” When it was pointed out that she had mentioned politicians in her remarks, she said, “I didn’t,” but when reminded that she had mentioned Booker and Murphy, she admitted it.\n\n“Correct, because I think Cory Booker and Governor Murphy have failed the state of New Jersey. If you look at what happened in crime, what's going on in Newark, what's going on in Camden, this has been a neglected state,” she said. “It is one of the most populated states for its size, and it needs to stop. We're going to do a bang-up job. I cannot wait. It's a great honor.”\n\nHabba did not answer repeated questions on why Trump appointed her to the role on an interim basis rather than permanently, and she would not say if she had political ambitions in New Jersey.\n\n“I look forward to working with [Attorney General] Pam Bondi, with the Department of Justice, and making sure that we further the president's agenda of putting America first, cleaning up mess and going after the people that we should be going after, not the people that are falsely accused,” she added. “That will stop in the great state of New Jersey, starting now.”\n\nEarlier Monday Habba posted on X, \"I am honored to serve my home state of New Jersey as Interim U.S. Attorney and I am grateful to President Trump for entrusting me with this tremendous responsibility. Just like I did during my time as President Trump’s personal attorney, I will continue to fight for truth and justice. We will end the weaponization of justice, once and for all.\"\n\nTrump said Habba would replace the current interim U.S. attorney, John Giordano, who he will nominate to be the ambassador to Namibia.\n\nHabba rose to fame as a member of Trump's circle after several years in private practice in New Jersey.\n\nAfter working as a merchandiser at fashion company Marc Jacobs for two years, Habba attended Widener University Commonwealth Law School in Pennsylvania, graduating in 2011. She served a yearlong clerkship with then-New Jersey Superior Court Judge Eugene Codey Jr. then worked in private practice for eight years at two separate firms before starting her own practice in 2020, focusing on civil and commercial litigation.\n\nAfter reportedly becoming acquainted with Trump through membership in his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Habba's big break with the former president came when she represented him in a $100 million lawsuit against the New York Times and his estranged niece, Mary L. Trump.\n\nThe New York Times lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, and Habba's other cases for Trump have resulted in a mixed record. She received praise from Trump after Summer Zervos, a former \"Apprentice\" contestant who accused the former president of sexual assault, dropped her defamation case against Trump.\n\nBut when Habba filed a lawsuit claiming that Hillary Clinton and others conspired to damage Trump's reputation, the judge overseeing the case dismissed the suit, accused Trump of \"using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries,\" and fined Trump and Habba nearly $1 million.\n\nHabba became linked to Trump by serving as his legal spokesperson on the heels of his four criminal indictments, and appearing by his side every day he has attended his civil fraud trial in New York. Along the way, her firm has been paid $3.6 million from Trump's political action committees, according to records reviewed by ABC News.\n\nShe has cited her experiences with the former president to not only defend his conduct but also his character. Appearing on Fox News after Trump was indicted for the unlawful retention of classified documents in Florida, she said of Trump, \"He's the most ethical American I know.\"\n\nIn announcing her appointment as counselor to the president in December, Trump said \"Alina has been a tireless advocate for Justice, a fierce Defender of the Rule of Law, and an invaluable Advisor to my Campaign and Transition Team. She has been unwavering in her loyalty, and unmatched in her resolve - standing with me through numerous 'trials,' battles, and countless days in Court.\"\n\n-ABC News' Peter Charalambous contributed to this report",

On Tuesday, BYD reported a record 777.1 billion yuan ($107 billion) in revenue for 2024 as sales of its electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%.

That comes against the background of a 28.4% increase in sales of all battery-electric cars in Europe.\n\nGerman politicians and opinion media sharply criticized Musk over his support for the AfD, while Tesla vehicles and dealerships have been the target of protesters in the U.S. and Europe over the AfD endorsement and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump in drastically reducing the size of the US federal government.\n\nTesla sales are falling globally, however. The company posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years in January. Tesla's new Cybertruck has had multiple recalls including last week, when the company recalled nearly all of them because panels that run along the left and right side of the windshield can fly off when driving.\n\nIt was the eighth recall of the Cybertruck since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago.",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy and lead negotiator tasked with ending the war in Ukraine, has attracted criticism in Europe and Ukraine after an interview where he appeared to back a number of well-known Kremlin talking points on the conflict.\n\nThe comments, in which Witkoff seemed to accept the results of sham referenda Russia has previously held in Ukraine to justify its seizure of land there -- including Crimea, will likely feed fears among European allies that the Trump administration is leaning too far toward the Kremlin's vision.\n\nIn the interview for \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" posted online on Friday, Witkoff talked about his efforts to negotiate with President Vladimir Putin, speaking warmly of the Russian leader. Witkoff said he believed the heart of the conflict was Russia's desire to control four regions of Ukraine it partially occupied and has claimed annexed since 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump listens as Steve Witkoff speaks during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, Jan. 7, 2025, in Palm Beach, Fla. Evan Vucci/AP, FILE\n\nTalking about Putin's claims to the regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Witkoff suggested Russia had a right to them because they were majority Russian-speaking and repeated a false Kremlin claim that fair referenda there showed residents wanted to be absorbed by Russia.\n\n\"They are Russian-speaking, and there have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule,\" Witkoff told Carlson.\n\nHowever, Witkoff did not acknowledge that the supposed referenda held in those territories -- whether in 2014 in the case of Crimea or 2022 in the other regions -- were widely dismissed by Western powers, human rights organizations and international bodies as fraudulent and illegitimate.\n\nRussia conducted referenda in the areas it occupied in Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in the fall of 2022, several months after seizing them with its full-scale invasion launched in February that year. Putin used the referenda to justify Russia's subsequent annexation of the regions. Russia also held a similar referendum in Crimea in 2014 following its occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula.\n\nThe referenda were staged after Russia's invasion had already forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to flee, and while Russian security forces were abducting and torturing anyone expressing opposition to its takeover. In some areas, Russian soldiers were filmed accompanying vote collectors as they went from house to house.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks with the governor of Krasnodar region Veniamin Kondratyev during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Mar. 24, 2025. Vyacheslav Prokofyev/Sputnik via AP\n\nNo legitimate independent international observers monitored the referenda and they were widely dismissed as shams, including by the United States. The United Nations General Assembly rejected the referenda as illegal and violating the U.N. Charter.\n\nIn September 2022, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. \"does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin's claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it's seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\"\n\nWitkoff made the remarks on the Russian referenda a day before a new round of talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia aimed at trying to make progress toward ending the war. His portrayal of the referenda as legitimate triggered some fierce criticism in Europe.\n\n\"Witkoff's repeating of Kremlin lies about 'russian-speakers' [sic] wanting to 'join Russia' is truly chilling,\" Lithuania's former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, wrote on X. \"Hearing Americans talk like this should be an electric shock for Europe, not a wakeup call.\"\n\nSome Ukrainian members of parliament also condemned Witkoff's comments.\n\nOleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the statements were \"shocking.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what this is about -- ignorance, naivety, unprofessionalism?\" said Merezhko, who suggested Witkoff should be removed from his negotiating role. \"Because we are talking about a representative of the president, who should professionally understand this issue and know some basic things. And he doesn't know this. He is relaying Russian propaganda.\"\n\nIn the interview with Carlson, Witkoff appeared to struggle to remember the names of the Ukrainian regions. \"Donbas, Crimea. You know the names,\" he told the conservative media personality, who prompted him to say \"Lugansk\" -- the Russian transliteration for Luhansk. \"Lugansk, and there's two others,\" Witkoff replied.\n\nAlthough Putin declared he had annexed the four regions, his troops still do not fully control most of the area. Much of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, including their regional capitals, remain unoccupied.\n\nA wealthy real estate developer, Witkoff has emerged as the lead negotiator for Trump's effort to end the war, twice now traveling to Moscow, where he has said he spent several hours talking with Putin.\n\nIn his interview on Carlson, Witkoff was effusive in his praise for Putin, calling him a \"very smart guy\" and noting Putin told him he had prayed for Trump after the assassination attempt against him during last year’s presidential campaign. Witkoff added that Putin had given him a portrait of Trump which he says the Russian leader had commissioned from a famous Russian artist.\n\n\"This is the kind of connection that we've been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said.\n\nMiddle East envoy Steve Witkoff attends and interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein/AP\n\nWitkoff also told Carlson he believed Russia \"does not need to absorb Ukraine,\" saying, \"They've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" He also said he \"100%\" believes Russia does not want to invade Europe, saying he took Putin \"at his word\" on that.\n\nWitkoff also repeated an unsupported claim made by Putin that Russian forces have surrounded a significant number of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Although Ukraine was forced to retreat from Kursk earlier this month, no evidence has emerged to suggest many Ukrainian soldiers are encircled, and both independent researchers and Ukrainian officials have said it is false.\n\n\"Witkoff uncritically amplified a number of Russian demands, claims and justifications,\" the Washington D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote.\n\nWitkoff's comments could feed deep unease in Europe that the Trump administration, which is moving fast to restore relations with Russia, is more aligned with the Kremlin than NATO allies over the war in Ukraine. European officials and observers have also warned the administration, in its hurry to reach a deal, is vulnerable to manipulation by Putin.\n\nThe White House has argued its reengagement with Russia brings peace closer, but critics point out that the Kremlin has, so far, yet to make any significant concessions. Trump has claimed he isn't \"aligned\" with Putin. \"I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world,\" Trump said last month.\n\nVice President JD Vance on Monday defended Witkoff, writing on X he was doing an \"incredible job.\"",

This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.\"\n\n\"Regardless of his allegations concerning political speech, Khalil withheld membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose continuing employment by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he submitted his adjustment of status application. It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the government said in the filing.\n\nDuring a State Department briefing Monday, spokesperson Tammy Bruce was asked multiple times about whether the department now viewed prior work for UNRWA as grounds for disqualification for visa applicants -- but she repeatedly declined to answer.\n\n\"If you lie in your efforts to come to the United States to get a visa for any reason, or for a green card, maybe there haven't been repercussions, or we haven't done things properly in the past.

Glenn Cohen, a professor of health law and bioethics at Harvard Law School, told ABC News that in one of 23andMe's bankruptcy filings, the company indicated that any bidder would have to express compliance with the current privacy statement.\n\nHowever, it's not uncommon for a new company to issue a new privacy statement and to ask people to click through to agree, he said.\n\nOne example of a change could be in how a new company would handle handing over data to law enforcement.\n\n\"Under the current 23andMe privacy rules, they will wait for a valid subpoena, search warrant or court order\" before sharing data with law enforcement, Cohen said. \"It's possible this new company would have a different approach and would get you to opt in to their privacy statements such that the information might be more readily shared with law enforcement or possibly with employers and insurance.\"\n\nAdditionally, about 80% of 23andMe users have selected the additional opt in for their data to be used for medical research.\n\nUnder existing 23andMe policy, when the data is shared with companies for research, it doesn't have names attached to the genetic samples.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThis information is not protected by HIPAA, which is a law that protects patient privacy and ensures the security of health information.\n\n\"Unlike your health records, which are covered by HIPAA, your electronic health records, and the kind of data you share with your doctor … 23andMe does business with you as a consumer, not as a patient,\" Cohen said. \"You don't get those overall federal health privacy protections that we give, for example, to the data you share with your doctor.\"\n\nAdded Caplan: \"The privacy law we have applies to information in health care settings. It doesn't apply to protecting information that you gave freely to a private company.\"\n\nConsumers have the option of deleting their account and asking for their sample to be destroyed, especially if they are in a state that has a genetic privacy law, such as California.\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General Rob Bonta put out a press release with steps on how to delete genetic data, destroy a test sample and to revoke permission for genetic data being used in research.\n\n\"There might be people out there who say, 'I'm fine with that, I think the risks are low, and I'm happy for a new company to share my data in x, y or z way,'\" Prince said. \"But to the extent that that it's somebody who does say, 'Oh, I didn't realize that that's how my data can be shared, or I just I trusted 23andMe but I don't know whether I trust the next company that might have this data, then they might want to consider going in and deleting that account.\"",

        "content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reduce the Department of Education to its essential functions. The directive tells what's left of the agency to prioritize sending money to school choice programs across America.\n\nThese programs -- which are also referred to as school vouchers and school freedom -- allow parents to take tax dollars allocated for their children to attend public schools and, in most cases, use that money to send them to private schools.\n\nTrump executive order seeks to steer federal funds to private school vouchers ABC News\n\nThe argument supporting this movement is that private schools often provide a better education for children.\n\nIn Tennessee, where supporters of the programs refer to them as scholarships, State House Rep. Todd Warner is a proud product of rural public schools. He's a self-described \"die-hard Republican,\" but told ABC News that he believes what some conservatives are currently trying to do to education is wrong.\n\n\"Public schools are the backbone of the community,\" Warner said. \"On Friday nights, Friday night lights, the football game. It's where everybody comes together. It's where we tailgate and see each other's family before the game. It's where we cheer each other's children on.\"\n\nFor the past four years at the Tennessee Statehouse, Warner represented what he refers to as \"country folk\" from counties so red that Confederate flags continue to fly over a few homes and monuments.\n\n\"I'm in favor of reducing the Department of Education on the federal level,\" Warner said. \"I would love to see President Trump send more money back to the states. I'm good with that, but I don't want to see that go to the private sector. I want to see it help our public schools.\"\n\nBut in February, Gov. Bill Lee signed Tennessee’s universal school choice program into law. It joined at least 29 states that allow some form of school vouchers, including about 15 states that do not consider parental wealth.\n\nWarner is currently working to limit the number of vouchers in Tennessee.\n\nHe may have a life size Trump cutout in his office and hang his red hat on the wall above a dead buck, but Warner told ABC News that he doesn't mind being called a sellout in Nashville because he knows that at home in the district he represents south of the city, his constituents know that isn't who he is.\n\n\"You know, the best memories in life that I have,\" Warner said. \"Some of them are in the public school, in high school, you know, with those teachers, with those coaches. And it's that way in a lot of rural Tennessee. I mean, it's the public school or it's nothing.\"",

It's how our enemies can take advantage of us.

If a government employee shared sensitive military plans like this, they'd be investigated and face very harsh consequences,\" Schumer said.\n\nHe also suggested that his Republican colleagues should be as \"outraged\" by this incident as they were over the email controversy involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the days before the 2016 election, which she lost to Trump.\n\n\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer ended his brief remarks by claiming that Democrats has anticipated an event like this one when they opposed Hegseth's nomination.\n\n\"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. we warned confirming them was dangerous, that they behaved recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right. Now, we must have accountability in both parties. The Senate should investigate how this blunder was even possible,\" Schumer said.\n\nClinton also reacted. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" she posted on X on Monday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also advocated for a congressional investigation and directly called out Hegseth.\n\n\"There should absolutely be a congressional investigation so that we can understand what happened. Why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again,\" Jeffries said at a press conference on Monday.\n\nJeffries, who got fired up when asked about the incident, called the situation \"reckless, irresponsible and dangerous\" and suggested that those involved were \"jeopardizing America's national security\" -- before sharply criticizing Hegseth.\n\n\"This whole Trump administration is filled with lackeys and incompetent cronies. I'm not talking about any particular individual, though,\" he said. \"I will note that the secretary of Defense who was on that chain has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history. Think about that.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson downplayed the flurry of national security concerns on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"Look, I'm not going to characterize what happened. I think the administration has acknowledged it was a mistake, and they'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again. I don't know what else you can say about,\" he told reporters at the Capitol, following a White House event where he appeared alongside Trump and the governor of Louisiana.\n\nJohnson added that he doesn’t believe Waltz or Hegseth should be disciplined for the incident.\n\nIn addition to his on-camera remarks, Jeffries released a statement on the national security breach, calling it \"completely outrageous.\"\n\n\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHe reiterated his call for a Congressional investigation into the matter -- even though Democrats have little power to do so since they are in the minority.\n\n\"If House Republicans are truly serious about keeping America safe, and not simply being sycophants and enablers, they must join Democrats in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach,\" he concluded.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks to reporters at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on Oahu, Hawaii, March 24, 2025.

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard)\n\nPARIS -- French actor Gérard Depardieu acknowledged Tuesday that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he testified for the first time at his landmark trial in Paris.\n\nShe told the court that he'd behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me.”\n\nDay 2 of the Paris trial centered on the Oscar-nominated actor's behavior during the filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.\n\nThe 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women. But during more than an hour of testimony Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.\n\nDepardieu said he'd been in a “bad mood\" because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.\n\n“I understand perfectly if she’s a bit upset,” he said in his gruff, deep voice so familiar to cinemagoers. “I don’t have to talk like that, get angry like that, voilà.\"\n\nBut he insisted that he isn't a sexual predator. “I’m not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.\n\nThe actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.\n\nThe set dresser testified after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.\n\nShe said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and \"in front, around.” She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.\n\n“That’s when I had a reflex of ‘My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn’t do it,\" she testified. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.\"\n\n“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she'd been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu’s hands from her.\n\n“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that’s what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. \"He terrified me, and that amused him.”\n\nShe said Depardieu’s calm and cooperative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.\n\n“Here, he’s exemplary, he doesn’t move, he’s quiet, he doesn’t make any noise,\" she said. “He’s not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.\"\n\nOn the movie set, “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,” she said.\n\nThe second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.\n\nBecause of Depardieu’s fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.\n\nHis long and storied career — he told that court that he's made more than 250 movies — has turned him into a giant of the French movie industry. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a “great actor” who \"makes France proud.” That was in 2023, when the star was already facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn his testimony, Depardieu said he'd noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behavior and language. He acknowledged that he sometimes has a potty mouth and that his behavior can be boorish.\n\n“I’ve always been told I have a Russian nature, I don’t know if it’s because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.\"\n\nBut he said he “never, ever” would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.\n\n“I’m not like that,\" he said.",

Some of the loudest applause in the church on Thursday came when speakers criticized the district's representative, Ryan Mackenzie -- who in 2024 narrowly flipped the seat held by Democrat Susan Wild.\n\nArnaud Armstrong, a spokesman for Mackenzie, told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that Mackenzie has answered questions at in-person events and would run a telephone town hall on Thursday night to allow for more people to speak with the congressman, including people with disabilities or seniors who might struggle to make it to an in-person event.\n\nDuring that telephone town hall, Mackenzie said, \"This is the best way that I have found to reach literally thousands of people at once and be able to have this kind of conversation.\"\n\nDisillusioned Democrats\n\nThe town halls come as Democratic voters show disillusion with their party.\n\nA recent CNN/SSRS poll taken in early March found that 52% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents felt that the leadership of the Democrats is taking the party in the wrong direction, and that 57% felt that the party should mainly work to \"stop the Republican agenda.\"\n\nWhile waiting in line outside to enter the town hall, some residents of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region told ABC News that President Donald Trump's actions struck close to home or worried them -- but that they felt disillusioned with the broader Democratic response so far.\n\n'Very mixed feelings' on Democrats' response to Trump\n\nCarole Ostfeld, a retired teacher from Allentown, Pennsylvania, came bearing a sign that said \"Hands off Medicaid.\" She and her husband David told ABC News that they came out to the town hall in order to protest Trump and Musk, including because of Trump's actions with the Department of Education.\n\nBut asked how they feel about the Democratic response to the Trump administration, Carole Ostfeld said, \"I've got very mixed feelings --\"\n\nHer husband added, \"It needs to be more.\"\n\nCarole and David Ostfeld of Allentown, PA, wait in line for a Democratic “People’s Town Hall” in Bethlehem, PA on March 20, 2025, with a sign that says “Hands Off Medicaid”. ABC News\n\nAsked if Democrats' messaging is resonating with them, Carole Ostfeld said it is -- but, \"as they say, you can't fight city hall,\" as Republicans are in power.\n\nAnother attendee, Ann Frechette of Easton, Pennsylvania, said the news about Trump signing an order to dismantle the Department of Education, which came that day, struck close to home. \"I have a son in college who benefits from a Pell Grant,\" she told ABC News. \"And I'm afraid that that Pell Grant will disappear, that monies like that will disappear. He's on Medicaid, I think he may lose his health insurance. There's so many things.\"\n\nAnn Frechette of Easton, PA, waiting in line for a Democratic “People’s Town Hall” in Bethlehem, PA on March 20, 2025. ABC News\n\nBut the broader Democratic response was disillusioning her as well. While she praised some individual lawmakers, including Raskin, she added, \"I think the Democrats in general, they don't -- I'm a Democrat, but my party doesn't seem to get the message that was delivered last November. I would like people to stand up to what is being done.\"\n\nFiring up supporters\n\nThat said, the town hall itself was by many measures a success -- or at least, the Democratic speakers were able to fire up their supporters.\n\nThe crowd at a Democratic “People’s Town Hall” in Bethlehem, PA on March 20, 2025. ABC News\n\nAll of the pews were filled, with some attendees standing on the back or the sides of the sanctuary; and the crowd gave thunderous standing ovations to the speakers multiple times – particularly when, for instance, Raskin spoke about taking on Trump or former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild criticized the incumbent representative.\n\nPeople paid attention as audience members shared their own stories and questions, and then applauded them warmly, cheering on their peers in a clear show of support.\n\nDuring a question and answer portion of the town hall, attendees raised concerns about the future of Medicaid, educational programs, and other issues.\n\nAnother attendee, Terri Neifert, told the crowd that she has lived in Bethlehem almost her entire life and became disabled after a fall at a grocery store, which changed the trajectory of her life. She said she managed to get her degree and to support her family through Medicare, food banks, and Social Security disability.\n\n\"If they cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps… I would lose everything,\" Neifert told the crowd.\n\nTerri Neifert of Bethlehem, PA addresses Democratic officials at a Democratic “People’s Town Hall” in Bethlehem, PA on March 20, 2025. ABC News\n\nNeifert received a round of applause from the audience, and other attendees went up to her after the event wrapped to thank her for sharing her story.\n\nAsked by ABC News after the town hall how she was feeling by then about the Democrats' response to the Trump administration, Neifert -- similar to other attendees -- focused on the road ahead.\n\n\"It looks like it's gonna be a fight, and an uphill battle... more public outcry, more marches, and Congress needs to pull up their big boy pants and start doing their job,\" Neifert said.\n\nGoing on the road\n\nSome Democrats or Democratic-aligned allies are taking a different tack than the town halls -- and going on the road.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez attend a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rally in Denver, Colorado, Mar. 21, 2025. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been on the road for weeks with what he calls the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, making stops for rallies in both right- and left-leaning districts. The Democratic Party has shown support for his efforts, reposting social media posts from Sanders about the tour.\n\nOut there on Sanders' tour, some attendees said they're disillusioned with the party's response to Trump.\n\n\"They gotta be a little tougher,\" one rally attendee told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl at the Denver event. Another was blunter: \"Quit being a bunch of doormats.\"\n\nBut -- in a sign that the rallies may be a successful tactic for Democrats to reach their base -- they're attracting thousands of people. Sander's Denver appearance, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., brought in more than 30,000 attendees.\n\nParticipants cheer as Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during the \"Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here\" rally at Civic Center Park in Denver, Colorado, Mar. 21, 2025. Jason Connolly/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.\n\nSanders himself has his own criticism for the Democratic Party, telling Karl in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the Democrats should have done more for working people when they had control of the Senate.\n\n\"And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people, in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't,\" Sanders told Karl.\n\nDonna Brazile, a former DNC chair and an ABC News contributor, said on \"This Week\" after Sanders' interview, said, \"Bernie Sanders is filling a void, a major void left after, of course, the defeat of Kamala Harris last year by Donald Trump. This void has to be filled because there's so much anger, anger not just in red districts, but also in blue districts.\"\n\nThat void is one that Democrats hope to fill with these events.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chair Ken Martin speaks with reporters after a Democratic “People’s Town Hall” in Bethlehem, PA on March 20, 2025. ABC News\n\nMartin, asked by ABC News after the Bethlehem town hall if he thought the messages of the Democrats is going to resonate in Republican districts or with Democrats themselves, said that wasn't really the point.\n\n\"It's really not about the message resonating,\" Martin said. \"What this is about is listening to people. Hearing the concerns of Americans right now throughout this country, who deserve to be heard, right?\"\n\nMartin added later: \"We're going to fill a void for them, and we're going to talk to more people throughout this country.\"\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie, Isabella Murray, Jonathan Karl, Meghan Mistry and Quinn Scanlan contributed to this report.",

I want to start fresh,\" said Abdullah, who appeared in a wrinkled beige jail smock over a bright orange T-shirt and spoke slowly and softly in response to several of the judge's questions.\n\nJudge Analisa Torres closed the courtroom for a private conference with Abdullah. When court resumed, Torres announced she would appoint new counsel and adjourn sentencing to April 7.\n\nFederal prosecutors have asked the court to imprison Abdullah for life.\n\n\"The defendant's terrorism crimes, combined with his specialized, al-Shabaab financed pilot skills, which he will have for the rest of his life, underscore that he poses a real and ongoing threat to innocent lives around the world. He remains a skillful, well-educated, and highly trained terrorist who is readily capable of hijacking a commercial aircraft to commit a terrorist act,\" federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum. \"Law enforcement thwarted the defendant's plot shortly before he obtained his commercial pilot's license -- inches away from bringing his murderous plans to fruition.\"\n\nKenyan national Cholo Abdi Abdullah is seen in a mugshot from his July 2019 arrest in the Philippines released by the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group. Criminal Investigation and Detection Group\n\nAbdullah wanted to fly a plane into the \"tallest buildings\" in Atlanta, including the 55-story Bank of America Plaza, on behalf of the terror group al-Shabab, federal prosecutors said.\n\nAs federal prosecutors described it, Abdullah sought to \"carry out a chilling plot to hijack a commercial airplane, crash it into a building in the United States, and recreate al Qaeda's horrific September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\"\n\nHe first trained with al-Shabaab for months in Somalia, learning to fire AK-47 assault rifles and make deadly explosives, prosecutors said. Then, he enrolled in a flight school in the Philippines and devoted hundreds of hours earning the flight certifications necessary to fly large commercial aircraft, prosecutors said.\n\n\"All told, the defendant secured his private pilot's license and came terrifyingly close to getting his commercial pilot's license just before he was arrested,\" prosecutors said.\n\nAbdullah joined Al-Shabaab in 2015 after becoming more religious and listening to the teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki. Facebook messages show regular communication between group members regarding training, prayers, planning attacks, getting money and plans for Abdullah to attend flight school, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter living in a safe house and receiving training for three months, Abdullah was sent to flight school in the Philippines. While he was away, some members of his safe house carried out a bombing and shooting at the DusitD2 complex in Nairobi, Kenya, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nAbdullah was arrested by officials in the Philippines in July 2019. During his interrogation, he said he told his mother he had joined Al-Shabaab and that she alerted authorities, prosecutors said. Abdullah cooperated with the FBI, providing details of who was communicating with, how he was trained and other information.",

The Trump administration is deporting immigrants that it claims are members of that gang who illegally crossed into the United States.\n\nTrump said his social media post would serve as notification of this policy to the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies.",

        "content": "Boasberg is at the center of the admin's legal fight over deportation flights.\n\nAs President Donald Trump's battle with the judiciary escalates, House Republicans are eyeing ways to rein in judges from blocking parts of his agenda.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan said on Monday his panel will hold hearings next week on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is at the center of the administration's legal fight over deportation flights and the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nTrump accused Boasberg -- an Obama appointee who was first named to a lower Washington, D.C., court by President George W. Bush -- of bias and called for his impeachment after he blocked the administration from using a centuries-old law to deport more than 200 alleged gang members to El Salvador.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies, including Jordan, have also taken issue with the use of injunctions and temporary restraining orders to halt Trump policies nationwide as the courts weigh the merits of each case.\n\n\"It really starts to look like Judge Boasberg is operating purely political against the president, and that's what we want to have hearings on -- this broad issue and some of what Judge Boasberg is doing,\" Jordan said on Fox News.\n\nJordan said he thought Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will do the same.\n\nIn addition to hearings, Jordan said he expects House Republican leadership to move forward with a bill from California Rep. Darrell Issa aimed at limiting some judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan speaks at a House Republicans press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 12, 2024. Craig Hudson/Reuters\n\nIssa's bill -- entitled the \"No Rogue Rulings Act\" -- would put restrictions on federal judges issuing orders providing injunctive relief that impacts the entire country outside their districts.\n\nJordan called it a \"good piece of legislation.\" The bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee before lawmakers broke for recess earlier this month.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson appears to be warming up to the idea of potentially impeaching judges who rule against Trump, saying \"everything is on the table.\"\n\n\"Impeachment is an extraordinary measure. We're looking at all the alternatives that we have to address this problem. Activist judges are a serious threat to our system,\" Johnson said Monday afternoon.\n\nJohnson confirmed that the GOP-led House will hold hearings to \"highlight the abuses\" of federal judges -- saying lawmakers \"may wind up questioning some of these judges themselves to have them defend their actions.\"\n\n\"We'll see about limiting the scope of federal injunctions,\" he added. \"One judge should not be able to suspend and uphold everything that a president does on their issues. I think the American people agree with that.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Johnson appeared to endorse the measure, writing on X that the House is \"working overtime to limit the abuses of activist federal judges.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's indicated he'd like to get this bill to the floor next week and move it through the process,\" Jordan told Fox News. \"So, we think there's some things we can do legislatively, and then, frankly, there's the broader issue of all these judges' injunctions and then decisions like Judge Boasberg ... what he's trying to do, and how that case is working.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the push from Trump, Elon Musk and several Republican hardliners to impeach Boasberg and other judges faces steeper obstacles.\n\nJohnson has not said where he stands on pursuing impeachment, but given the slim House majority, it would be extremely difficult to get the House Republican conference together to vote to impeach a judge.\n\nIf the House were to successfully impeach a judge, the Senate would be compelled to act in some way, but the odds of a Senate conviction are almost zero, as it would require support from at least 14 Democrats.\n\nAs the rhetoric ramps up between the Trump administration and the courts, the U.S. Marshals Service is warning federal judges of an increase in threats, ABC News reported. Chief Justice John Roberts last week issued a rare public statement amid Trump's attacks on Boasberg, saying impeachment was not \"an appropriate response\" to legal disagreements and that the correct path forward was the appeals process.",

In February, Trump ordered federal agencies to look into virtually every U.S. trading partner in evaluating what reciprocal tariff rate to put on them.\n\n“April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!”\n\nTrump’s officials have been signaling a more conciliatory tone in recent interviews.\n\n“One of the things we see from markets is they’re expecting ... these really large tariffs on every single country,” Kevin Hassett, Trump’s National Economic Council director, said on Fox News. “I think markets need to change their expectations, because it’s not everybody that cheats us on trade, it’s just a few countries and those countries are going to be seeing some tariffs.”\n\nThe administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said.\n\n“It’s 15% of the countries, but it’s a huge amount of our trading volume,” U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said last week.\n\nLast year, according to federal census data, the U.S. had the biggest trade deficits with China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and South Africa.\n\nBloomberg previously reported on the altered plans for tariffs. The Trump administration will likely forego sector-specific tariffs on autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors that were also previously planned for April 2, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nU.S. stocks surged on Monday on the news of narrower tariff plans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 500 points, or 1.2%, while the S &P 500 jumped 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased more than 2%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump looks on during a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Mar. 24, 2025, in Washington.

In short order, Trump has paused or reversed some tariffs, casting doubt over his plans and adding to the uncertainty, experts previously told ABC News.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this month slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, though the White House soon imposed a one-month delay for some of those tariffs. A fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China a month prior.\n\nTariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on March 12 triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada and the European Union, adding to countermeasures already initiated by China.\n\nEconomists widely expect tariffs to increase inflation, since exporters typically pass along a share of the tax to consumers in the form of price hikes.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said Trump’s tariffs are partly to blame for price increases, leveling the criticism minutes after the central bank announced its decision to hold interest rates steady.\n\nEven as the Fed left its main policy lever unchanged, the central bank predicted weaker year-end economic growth and higher inflation than it had in a December forecast.\n\nABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report.",

It’s also sometimes called the Wildflower National Park because it boasts the most varieties of flowering plants: more than 1,500. For 75 years since 1951, the park has hosted the Spring Wildflower Pilgrimage, today a four-day gathering. Participants can get up close to the Smokies’ seasonal starlets, like mountain laurel, flame azaleas, and 10 different species of trillium. While some eastern sections of the park remain closed due to damage from Tropical Storm Helene, others became easier to access after the recent reopening of Interstate 40 near the two states’ dividing line.\n\nCacti in Arizona’s Saguaro National Park\n\nPeak bloom: April, May\n\nYou might not expect eye-catching blooms in a seemingly hostile desert, but if you make a springtime visit to Saguaro National Park, outside of Tucson, you’ll find plenty of them. The park’s namesake species of cactus grows only in the Sonoran Desert, and wow, how it grows: Very slowly at first—as little as an inch in 10 years—and then much faster until it reaches an average height of 40 feet. A saguaro doesn’t flower before the age of 30; when it’s finally mature enough to reproduce, bouquets with white petals and golden centers emerge overnight from the plant’s characteristic arms.",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "‘It’s the curvy path’\n\nThis whole journey started because Roberts’ took a leap of faith.\n\nAs a media professional, Roberts has worked for CosmoGirl, Essence, Ebony and Heart & Soul magazines. She eventually started her own entrepreneurial publishing nonprofit endeavors, sharing stories of women changemakers around the world. She followed a job to D.C. in 2016, and visited the newly-inaugurated National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n“That’s how I saw the photograph that changed everything.”\n\nHad she not moved to D.C., she says she may not have visited the museum. And had she visited as tourist and not a resident, she may not have meandered the museum’s halls with such leisure, and she may not have taken notice of the details of one portrait in particular.\n\n“I think all of those things were leading me to this moment. It’s all connected, it’s the curvy path,” says Roberts.\n\nThe photo of a crew of Black women in wet suits aboard a boat was her first encounter with DWP. It beckoned her to follow. She phoned the co-founder, Kenneth Steward. She pledged to join them.\n\n“The universe works in strange ways,” says Roberts, reflecting on how she grew up nowhere near an ocean.\n\n“I imagined the divers. And then I imagined myself as one of them. I didn’t know it would lead anywhere, I just knew I wanted to know more.”\n\nSo she quit her job to follow the divers and help tell their stories.\n\nA way of honoring ancestors\n\nThe March, 2022 issue of National Geographic magazine featured Roberts, making her the first Black woman Explorer to grace the cover of the publication. Photograph by Wayne Lawrence\n\nRoberts’ path shows a nuanced story as she ricochets from peaks and valleys toward a calling. It’s the detail and complexity she aims for in the narratives she uncovers in her work.\n\n“Think about the Clotilda shipwreck… that’s a story that no one would know if the Clotilda descendants hadn’t been like ‘oh, we have saved artifacts and the stories of our ancestors, we’re not going to let anyone forget them.’”\n\nThe Clotilda , Roberts reflects, represents a uniquely complete story. The vessel sailed in 1860, illegally transporting captive Africans from present-day Benin to Mobile, Alabama. It is said a wealthy landowner by the name of Timothy Meaher challenged Northern businessmen with a thousand-dollar wager, claiming he could slip African people past federal officials and into Mobile Bay.\n\nThe ship itself is remarkably well-preserved in the muddy freshwater of Alabama’s Mobile River, compared to other wrecks, which are often shattered on the sea floor, coalesced into the marine ecosystem, or dissolved over time. And the Clotilda’s African survivors, who were removed from the ship as the captain burned it to hide evidence, established the community of Africatown in Mobile once they were freed from enslavement after the Civil War. They neighborhood they established eventually grew into a community of tens of thousands, including their descendants. It still exists today and which continues to honor the stories of those ancestors from the nation’s last known slave ship.\n\n“That's often not what you get around stories that involve African Americans,\" Roberts says. \"Most of us cannot trace our histories all the way back to a slave ship or to a particular country in Africa because the records of the enslaved were not recorded in detail. So it’s incredible and very powerful that these descendants know the actual stories of their ancestors that came from Africa.\"\n\nFor the podcast Roberts interviewed not only the descendants of those on slave ships, but close to 100 other historians, archaeologists and community members about their unique relationships to this history. “By the end of it, I realized that these weren’t just stories of death, that these were stories of life, too,” Roberts recalls.\n\n“It’s a complicated history, but that’s the way history is supposed to be.”\n\nThe Christianus Quintus and Federicus Quartus wreck site were the first dive Roberts recalls leaving an impression on her, “I felt more than anything a sense of agency and power,” she says.\n\nIn 1710 two Danish slave ships, the Christianus Quintus and Fredericus Quartus went down in the Atlantic. Some 40,000 Danish bricks signaled the wreckage to experts in the 1970s, despite their considerable decomposition. A cannon and large anchor are still laid out as artifacts on the seabed. After quashing a revolt, the two vessels veered off course, missing their St. Thomas destinations by over a thousand miles, the crews mutinied, freed approximately 650 captive people due to dwindling resources, and scuttled the vessels which now lie in the ocean sands of present-day Costa Rica.\n\nAs the site came into view for Roberts, “I felt, ‘I see you and I’m going to help bring this story back to human memory. We are going to help make sure you are honored, not forgotten.’”",

        "content": "“The changes are pretty drastic,” says Christine Dow, a glacial hydrologist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, whose team co-led the new study. These evolving rivers could cause glaciers to melt and slide more quickly into the ocean. “We are under-predicting how fast things are going to change and how much ice loss there’s going to be in the next 80 years,” she says.\n\nThese findings, published March 20 in Nature Communications, stem from 20 years of work to map the hidden continent cloaked beneath Antarctica’s ice sheets.\n\nAn unexplored world under ice\n\nNo human has ever seen these hidden mountains and valleys. But over the last few decades, planes have flown hundreds of lines crisscrossing Antarctica, using ice-penetrating radar and precise measurements of gravity and magnetic fields to peer under the ice.\n\nUnlimited Access for Less Subscribe now and save $10 SUBSCRIBE\n\nThose surveys found mile-high mountain ranges, broad valleys, and deep canyons. Radar also revealed the flat, bright reflections of several hundred subglacial lakes beneath. Those lakes are fed by water that slowly melts off the base of the ice sheet, a fraction of an inch per year, due to geothermal heat seeping from deep inside the earth, and from the friction of ice sliding over land.\n\nScientists also realized that subglacial rivers often flow in or out of the lakes. Those rivers can act in strange ways, since they obey not only gravity, but also the crushing pressure of the ice overhead, says Anna-Mireilla Hayden, a Ph.D. student in glacial hydrology who is on Dow’s team at the University of Waterloo.",

The research team aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor (too) ship were confident they’d find animals at their destination. But they were shocked at the explosion of life they discovered—a forest of sponges, giant sea spiders, icefish, octopuses, huge corals, anemones, and ethereal deep-sea jellyfish.\n\nMarine biology is known to be highly adaptive and extremely resilient. “It’s not an absolute surprise that we have life,” says Sasha Montelli, a geophysicist and glaciologist at University College London and expedition team member. But “biologists were really surprised by the richness of it—how colorful, how spectacular it was.”",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "A bizarre fish behavior has resurfaced in the Florida Keys, and scientists are working diligently to uncover the cause and its potential long-term effects.\n\nIn fall 2023, fish and rays were seen spinning in circles and swimming erratically. Critically endangered smalltooth sawfish would thrash back and forth and began washing up dead on beaches. The unusual phenomenon affected over 80 species, including snapper, bull sharks, and goliath grouper. The event alarmed scientists and conservationists, particularly with sawfish dying in unprecedented numbers. By April 2024, the behavior seemed to subside, but questions remained.\n\nAfter extensive testing of water and fish samples, researchers determined that the affected fish likely died from exposure to multiple toxins produced by various species of dinoflagellates—a type of microscopic algae. “Last year, we had some great evidence that increased abundance of these harmful algaes was in the same locations where fish were spinning,” says Thomas Matthews, program administrator with Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.\n\n0:08\n\nNow, fish are spinning again, though in smaller numbers and happening in a much smaller geographic area, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). One question is whether these fish are experiencing new symptoms or if they’re still suffering from last year’s exposure. What’s perplexing is that algae levels in the water are relatively low, unlike during the 2023-2024 event, says Matthews.\n\nSince December 2024, FWC has received 44 reports of fish exhibiting spinning behavior, adding to more than 500 related reports since December 2023. Among these new reports, 22 have involved sawfish, including six confirmed deaths, with another likely occurring on March 20, according to Matthews. “There's a sawfish 200 yards from me on the shoreline right now that we've got a team taking blood from to figure out what's going on,” he said. “It’s so sad, these are amazing animals.”",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "With evocative names such as “Dragon Girl” and “Cherries in the Snow” and worn by the likes of Cleopatra and Taylor Swift, red lipstick has endured as a timeless emblem of beauty and power. The recent discovery of trace pigments—a mix of vegetal wax and powdered minerals—resembling modern lipstick recipes in a 4,000-year-old vial from Iran only adds to its legacy.\n\nToday, red lipstick continues to be a statement of confidence and glamour, but its meaning is fluid and diverse. For some, it represents classic femininity and sophistication; for others, it’s a bold assertion of individuality and defiance. Its allure lies not just in its hue but in the myriad interpretations and emotions it evokes.\n\nThe ancient origins of red lipstick\n\nRed lip coloring dates to 3500 B.C . when ancient Mesopotamia’s Queen Puabi (aka Shubad) used a concoction of white lead and crushed red rocks to stain her lips to symbolize her status in power. The trend caught on: archeological excavations revealed that many wealthy Sumerians were buried with lip colorants stored in cockle shells. Aristocrats of ancient Egypt favored red ochre mixed with resin to fashion bold red lips. Queen Cleopatra preferred carmine, a deep red pigment extracted from cochineal bugs.\n\nIn ancient Greece, red lips were associated with sex workers, who risked punishment for “improperly posing as ladies” if they appeared in public without their designated lip paint made from ingredients as various as mulberries, seaweed, sheep sweat, and crocodile excrement, according to Sarah E. Schaffer, author of “Reading our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power.”\n\n(The idea of beauty is always shifting. Today, it’s more inclusive than ever.)\n\nBy the Roman Empire, lip coloring was commonplace again, with vibrant shades indicating higher status. However, as Schaffer writes, expensive ingredients like mercury-laden vermillion were “potentially deadly poison; those poor persons who had to rely on red wine sediment for their lip color likely fared better in the end.”\n\nFrom royalty to witchcraft\n\nDuring her reign in the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I popularized the use of red lipstick among the aristocratic class in England. Photograph by Philip Mould Ltd, London/Bridgeman Images\n\nSchaffer writes that during the Middle Ages, “when the Crusades reintroduced Western Europe to the extensive Middle Eastern use of cosmetics, lipstick acquired a slightly wicked allure.” Christians considered makeup to be in opposition to religious teachings that emphasized humility and natural beauty as part of God’s design.\n\nIn England, red lipstick was thought to possess the power to repel malevolent spirits. Queen Elizabeth I, a fervent believer, famously adorned her lips with a custom crimson hue made from cochineal, gum arabic, egg whites, and fig milk. Her regal endorsement sparked a trend, and red lipstick surged in popularity during her reign (1558-1603).\n\n(A royal obsession with black magic started Europe’s most brutal witch hunts.)\n\nHowever, with the reign of her successor, James I (1603-1625), societal fears surrounding witchcraft cast a shadow over cosmetic practices. By 1770, a law was passed stating that any woman deemed to be using makeup as a means of tricking men into marriage could be tried as a witch.\n\nWomen marched through New York City during the suffrage movement of 1912 with bold, red lips in defiance of the patriarchy. Photograph by Bridgeman Images\n\nThe color of rebellion\n\nRed lipstick took on new significance during the 1920s suffragette movement, symbolizing the fight for women’s rights. Beauty entrepreneur Elizabeth Arden inspired women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Emmeline Pankhurst to wear red lipstick as a badge of courage when she distributed lipstick tubes to suffragettes in 1912.\n\nOver the following decades, red lipstick became increasingly popular. Vogue declared in 1933 that “if we were perpetuating the gestures of the 20th century for posterity, putting on lipstick would head the list.”\n\nWhile wearing a belt of 50-calibre shells, Phyllis Cotter applies lipstick at the Douglas Aircraft Company manufacturing facility in Santa Monica, California in this circa 1943 photo. Photograph by Tom Stimson, FPG/Getty Images\n\nBy World War II, red lipstick evolved from a symbol of rebellion to one of patriotic femininity and resilience, with shades like “Fighting Red!” and “Victory Red!” becoming popular. Schaffer writes that red lipstick was “a vital part of the war effort.” Arden produced a shade to match the bright crimson trimmings of the female Marines’ uniforms, and factory dressing rooms were stocked with lipstick to boost workers’ morale. Hitler, apparently, hated it.\n\n(Five “Rosie the Riveters” share wisdom for navigating life in challenging times.)\n\nThe bold red lip remained a classic choice after World War II, as Hollywood icons like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe made it a fashion staple. Its legacy is seen in modern-day celebrities like Taylor Swift, who often sports scarlet lips.\n\nThroughout her career as a singer-songwriter and pop icon, Taylor Swift has frequently been seen sporting scarlet lips, making it an integral part of her image. Photograph by John Shearer, Getty Images\n\nBut its timeless appeal continues to captivate and empower individuals, reaffirming its status as an emblem of rebellion and strength. In 2018, the #SoyPicoRojo campaign in Nicaragua featured men and women wearing red lipstick protesting the nation’s dictatorship. In 2019, thousands of women in Chile donned red lipstick to denounce sexual violence, proving the bold red lip has never truly gone out of style.",

It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.\n\nHe was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett . Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.\n\n“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”\n\nAs an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats. He shares them with the world through his visual storytelling, which offers his audiences first-time glimpses into rarely-seen phenomena in the natural world, and urges viewers to protect its vulnerable inhabitants.",

        "content": "Spring is a magical time to witness wildlife in action, as animals emerge from winter and migratory birds return. From paddling alongside wild ponies on Virginia’s Eastern Shore to spotting baby bison in Yellowstone National Park, here are seven unforgettable adventures that will take you to wildlife-rich spots across the U.S. Keep in mind, however, that the best wildlife encounters happen when you keep a respectful distance and observe responsible practices, so grab your binoculars and get ready for a spring wildlife safari.\n\nKayak to see wild ponies on Chincoteague Island, Virginia\n\nOn the left, two colts play in Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Chincoteague Island, Va.

Photograph By Kristel Richard/ Nature Picture Library\n\nLocated on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, Chincoteague is a pristine barrier island known for its iconic wild ponies, which were made famous by the 1961 film Misty of Chincoteague. The island’s salt marshes, sandy beaches, and quiet coves of the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge are ideal for grazing and wading ponies. To truly experience them, paddle the island’s waterways.\n\n“The thing about kayaking is that you can go much further up these shallow, narrow creeks,” says Laura Scharle, an avid kayaker and certified ecotour guide based in Ocean Pines, Maryland. “When you paddle, you have a better chance of getting a closer look at the ponies.” Scharle recommends paddling at high tide to access more remote areas of the refuge.\n\nFor guided kayak tours, do your research and choose a responsible local outfitter that prioritizes respectful wildlife viewing practices, allowing you to observe the ponies from a safe distance–at least 50 feet–without disturbing them in their natural environs. The best paddling season is from April to October.\n\n(Related: The story of the mythical origins of Chincoteague ponies may actually be real.)\n\nGo birdwatching in Everglades National Park, Florida\n\nBirdwatchers may spot wood storks (Mycteria americana) in addition to other bird species when visiting Everglades National Park, Fla. Photograph By Scott Leslie/ Minden\n\nFlorida’s Everglades National Park is a bird watcher’s paradise, home to more than 360 species of birds, including herons, egrets, wood storks, and roseate spoonbills. This vast subtropical wetland spans 1.5 million acres, offering plenty of opportunities to spot wading and migratory birds. Respect natural surroundings by staying quiet and giving birds space, especially during nesting season, from March to September.\n\nThe Anhinga Trail, a short boardwalk loop that starts at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, is a favorite among birders, as is the open-air Shark Valley Tram, which rewards visitors with sweeping views across the lush wetlands. The Guy Bradley Visitor Center in Flamingo offers daily ranger-guided bird walks from mid-December to mid-April.\n\nSpring migration is a wonderful time to witness migratory birds pass through the park. Tod Dahlke, owner of a wildlife eco-tour company in Everglades City, Florida, notes that birding is good in the spring due to “lower water levels, which make it desirable for many wading birds.” He adds that early morning is the best time to see birds when they are most active and vocal.\n\n(Related: Going birding for the first time? Here’s what you need to get started.)\n\nSpot baby bison at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\n\nAmerican Bison—a mother and calf—walk and graze as the sun rises over Yellowstone National Park, Wyo. Photograph By Sean Crane, Nat Geo Image Collection\n\nYellowstone National Park is a haven for wildlife enthusiasts, especially in spring when bison calves—nicknamed “red dogs” for their orange-red coats—make their debut in the park. The Lamar Valley is a prime location to see baby bison, often alongside elk, bighorn sheep, and even brown and black bears. Keep your eyes peeled, but observe silently and avoid sudden movements so as not to startle wildlife. New bison arrivals can appear as early as late April.\n\n“Yellowstone is a must-see destination for megafauna, like elk and bison. It’s just an incredible experience to see a bison in the wild,” says Todd Walton of Yellowstone National Park Lodges, which offers a Wake Up to Wildlife guided tour from mid-May to early October. “Springtime is incredibly unique because you do have the bison babies and the elk babies.”\n\nFor prime viewing, start at Mammoth Hot Springs, then head east to Lamar Valley, where pull-offs provide excellent wildlife-watching opportunities. Never approach or feed wildlife, and always stay at least 25 yards away from a bison. Bison may look slow, but they can run up to 35 mph. Use binoculars or a zoom lens for viewing.\n\n(Related: Birds, bison, and bears—learn how to see wildlife from your car.)\n\nTake a wildlife cruise at Channel Islands National Park, California\n\nCalifornia sea lions play in the safety of shallow water off the coast of Santa Barbara Island, part of the Channel Islands National Park. Photograph Alex Mustard/Nature Picture Library\n\nOff the Southern California coast, Channel Islands National Park, an eight-island archipelago, is a haven for marine life, from sea lions and dolphins to whales and seabirds. Spring marks the arrival of California sea lions and northern fur seals at their rookery sites. With pupping season beginning as early as May, you may see playful pups basking in the sun, but keep your voices low to minimize stress or disruption to their natural behaviors.\n\nEarly spring marks the end of whale-watching season, when gray whales may be seen breaching or slapping their tails. The park is only accessible by boat, so plan ahead and book a wildlife-watching cruise with Island Packers, the park’s official boat concessionaire, which offers cruises to five of the park’s islands. They also offer non-landing cruises along the Santa Barbara Channel, where you might encounter sea lions, dolphins, and off-shore birds, like sooty shearwaters and black-footed albatrosses. As you cruise, help keep the ocean clean by securing your belongings to prevent waste from unintentionally going overboard.\n\n(Related: Whale watching is booming. Here’s how to do it responsibly.)\n\nPaddle with manatees at Silver Springs State Park, Florida\n\nA paddleboarder enjoys the serene, navigable waterways at Silver Springs State Park near Ocala, Fla. Because of their portability and quiet approach, paddleboards are the perfect mode of transport to explore the park and wildlife, from a safe distance. Photograph By Todd Anderson/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn Central Florida, Silver Springs State Park caters to nature lovers, especially during manatee season from mid-November to late March. The park’s crystal-clear, spring-fed waters allow visitors to quietly and respectfully observe these gentle sea cows, free from motorized disturbances as gas- and electric-powered boats are prohibited.\n\nAn easy paddle in a canoe or kayak gets you up close to manatees. Consider a guided clear kayak tour with a responsible local outfitter for a unique viewing experience. “To see them swim under the kayaks was incredible. There were so many manatees, too,” says Max Gifford, who visited the park during a road trip across Florida.\n\nAs you paddle, give manatees space and avoid splashing, poking, or disturbing manatees as they swim. Beyond manatees, keep your eyes open for turtles, wading birds, and even wild monkeys.\n\n(Related: There have never been more manatees in Florida than there are now.)\n\nWatch brown bears at Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska\n\nA brown bear roams along a creek in Geographic Harbor, Alaska. Photograph By Acacia Johnson, Nat Geo Image Collection\n\nHome to 2,200 brown bears, Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve is a sought-after bear-viewing destination. Situated along the Brooks River and Naknek Lake, the park offers numerous ways to witness these powerful animals in the wild responsibly.\n\nStart at Brooks Camp, where brown bears gather to feast on sockeye salmon. From early June to mid-September, the visitor center hosts ranger-led programs. Three viewing platforms offer prime spots to watch bears from a safe distance, ensuring their normal behaviors remain undisturbed.\n\n“Watching bears in their natural habitat is just an awesome experience,” says Jillian Simpson, Alaska Travel Industry Association President and CEO. “It’s an adventure you must have in your lifetime.” Local outfitters offer guided trips, including full-day excursions to Brooks Falls. Don’t forget that bears are predators and should never be approached. Always maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from a grizzly bear, which can run up to 35 miles an hour.\n\n(Related: How to see Katmai's famous brown bears up close—and stay safe.)\n\nWitness free-roaming elk herds in Benezette, Pennsylvania\n\nAn elk bull searches for a 'companion' by bugling—or produces a loud mating call—in Benezette, Pa. Photograph By iStock / Getty Images\n\nBenezette, known as the “Elk Capital of Pennsylvania,” is home to one of the largest free-roaming elk herds in the eastern United States. Spring is a great time to observe these majestic creatures as they graze in the meadows from a respectful distance of at least 50 yards. Binoculars or a spotting scope can provide up-close views.\n\nTo increase your chances of seeing elk, visit in the early morning or late afternoon—about an hour after dawn or an hour before dusk. Elk are most active at these times and move between feeding areas and sheltered woodlands.\n\nTop viewing spots include the Elk Country Visitor Center, as well as wildlife viewing areas at Hicks Run, Winslow Hill, and Dents Run. The 127-mile Elk Scenic Drive features 23 designated elk viewing sites as well as stunning vistas and scenic hiking trails. Keep in mind that if an elk stops feeding or changes direction, it’s a sign you’re too close.\n\n(Related: Read why you should never pick up a wild animal. Especially a baby wombat.)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nThe Cotswolds fulfils every picture of rural England you might care to conjure. Pretty villages of ancient stone houses curl around country lanes, with low hills rolling between. Handsome market towns brim with antique shops and coaching inns. Sweeping over six counties in the south west, the region was made rich in the Middle Ages by the wool trade, and retains an air of unruffled, comfortable respectability. The Cotswolds’ quality produce has long been brought to life on menus in hotel restaurants and pubs with rooms, but openings and refurbishments over the past decade have brought a dash of retro cool and playful whimsy to the accommodation scene, too.\n\nThe countryside retreat The Pig in the Cotswolds blends cosy elegance with fresh, locally sourced dining. Photograph by Jake Eastham\n\nBest for: local produce\n\nThe smell of log fires greets you as you enter The Pig in the Cotswolds, the 10th addition to the hotel group’s litter, which opened near Cirencester in Gloucestershire in late 2024. The 17th-century manor house — all honey-coloured stone and mullion windows — radiates a sense of homely comfort, from the warmth of the welcome to the simple elegance of bedrooms decorated in florals. That floral theme is brought to life in the arts and crafts-style garden, a legacy of one-time owner and horticulturalist Rosemary Verey. Star of the show is the restaurant’s 25 Mile Menu, with all ingredients sourced within a 25-mile radius of the hotel. Fresh herbs and beetroots from the kitchen garden and Cotswold lamb might appear on a changing menu of imaginative dishes served in the rustic dining room. Rooms: From £250.\n\nBreakfast at The Rectory hotel is served in an airy winter garden with views of the grounds. Photograph by Ed Schofield\n\nBest for: homely elegance\n\nBuilt in the 18th century, with enough bedrooms to accommodate the incumbent’s 14 children, The Rectory in the small Wiltshire village of Crudwell found a different calling when it became a boutique hotel in 2017. Many original features remain: framed antique maps and period furniture now complement the stone fireplaces, wide wooden floorboards and flagstone floors. The ambience is relaxed, with guests playing Monopoly by the fire in one of the lounges or drinking martinis on a squishy velvet sofa in the bar. Meals — taken in the wood-panelled dining room or adjoining glasshouse — are a highlight, and dishes might include pheasant tortellini or hake with brown shrimp, parsley and anchovy sauce. Walk it off with a stroll round the walled garden before dozing in one of 18 bedrooms, each a little cocoon of calm and some featuring quirks such as in-room roll-top baths. Rooms: From £170, B & B.\n\nBest for: ramblers\n\nAll timbered ceilings and roaring fireplaces, this historic pub has stood in the village of Charlbury, Oxfordshire, since the 1500s. If you’ve been exploring the surrounding countryside, you’ll likely be drawn inside by the prospect of a few small plates in the downstairs restaurant, whose chef works closely with local farmers to produce dishes at one with the seasons. Up a narrow spiral staircase, the best of The Bull’s 10 rooms look out onto honeyed stone cottages stitched into sage hills. Each bedroom has been designed with the weary rambler in mind, with vintage felt couches and, in the largest rooms, freestanding baths in which to soak weary limbs. You’ll even find a pair of hazel walking sticks by the door — an invitation to get lost, at least for a little while. Rooms: From £150.\n\nThyme’s English Rose room is a quintessential country dream in pink. Photograph by Rachael Smith, Thyme\n\nBest for: connecting with nature\n\nThe natural world runs like a thread through Thyme in Gloucestershire, from the botanical prints and floral wallpaper designed by founder Caryn Hibbert to a menu that changes depending on what’s ready to be plucked from the kitchen gardens. The spa, too, makes use of botanicals drawn from Thyme’s water meadows, with unique treatments focused on scents and breathwork. Once you’ve explored the grounds, keeping an eye out for the myriad bird species drawn to its wild spaces, the hotel is an elementally calm place to return to. Natural materials and original features shine in the restored farm buildings that house the guest rooms, bar, boutique and gallery. The enormous Ox Barn restaurant, with vaulted ceiling, is an impressive setting in which to enjoy some of that homegrown produce, in dishes such as duck with prunes, apple and radicchio. Rooms: From £400, B & B.\n\nBest for: distinctive design\n\nLewis Carroll got the idea for Alice in Wonderland while strolling the grounds of this 17th-century pile near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and guests today might also feel they’ve fallen down the rabbit hole. The hotel embraces bold colours and modern art, its Italianate bones dotted with playful chequerboard rugs and glazed lava stone. Thirty-six distinct, spacious bedrooms range from a three-floor ‘treehouse’ to a suite with a four-poster bed and private terrace. Owned by the same group as Paris’s Experimental Cocktail Club, the bar offers a wildcard-packed drinks list soundtracked by live DJ sets, while inventive meals are served in a magnificent, wood-panelled dining room. When you’re done with decadent loafing, head to the spa’s modernist swimming pool, where floor-to-ceiling windows offer glimpses of Churn Valley woodland. Rooms: From £302, B & B.\n\nCowley Manor's interiors embrace modern art, its Italianate bones and chequerboard decor reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. Photograph by Mr Tripper\n\nBest for: local life\n\nThink of a quintessential country pub and you’ll picture something like this 17th-century inn in Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, with its flagstones, exposed beams and decorative cartwheels. The bar’s a hangout for locals, who pop in for hand-pulled beer by the log burner, and the restaurant offers a gastro take on the classics, from prawn cocktail to game pie. Up a creaking staircase are eight simple rooms featuring prints by 19th-century textile designer William Morris, who had a home in the village, now open as a museum. Rooms: From £95, B & B.\n\nBest for: modern art\n\nTake a 16th-century farmhouse, add elements of a contemporary gallery and you get this place in the Oxfordshire village of South Leigh. William Morris wallpaper and mismatched furnishings in its pub provide a backdrop to pop-art prints and neon signs, while the restaurant serves dishes such as braised beef with bone marrow mash to diners on burnt-orange banquettes. Most of the nine rooms are in the outbuildings; among them is the Stable Room, with original wood beams and a freestanding bath. Rooms: From £150.\n\nBest for: gastropub culture\n\nEase your vehicle through a stone carriage archway before walking through a weathered door into a room with a blazing hearth: arriving at this converted coaching inn probably feels much as it did 400 years ago. Welcoming staff serve high-end pub food championing local produce, enjoyed in the cosy dining room or by the fire. All six bedrooms offer a muted palette enhanced by florals and stripes. New for 2025 is self-catering property Little Barn, sleeping four. Rooms: From £195, or Little Barn from £445, both B & B.\n\nFoxhill Manor is a master at informal luxury, welcoming guests to make themselves at home. Photograph by Foxhill Manor\n\nBest for: laid-back luxury\n\nIf you’ve wondered what it might be like to live in a very big house in the country, at least for a bit, book in at Foxhill Manor. On a 500-acre estate overlooking Worcestershire’s Broadway village, the vibe at the arts and crafts villa is ‘make yourself at home’. There are no set meal times or formal dining room, so guests wander into the kitchen to discuss preferences with the chef and eat when and where they fancy — perhaps in an armchair by the fire or a window seat overlooking the grounds. Staff manage the rare feat of attending to your every whim with friendly informality, whether topping up the free-flowing Champagne, delivering afternoon tea to the private cinema or firing up the hot tub in time for a sunrise dip. With only eight rooms — all unique though sharing a timelessly elegant style and generous proportions — you’re soon making friends with other guests. Rooms: From £720, B & B.\n\nA medium room at the Double Red Duke offers ultimate relaxation with a freestanding bedside bathtub. Photograph by Chris Terry\n\nBest for: a sense of fun\n\nNamed for the 16th-century duke who lived here and gifted Double Red Corn to villagers, the first thing you notice at this Clanfield hotel is its parasols: candy-striped against honeyed stone. Inside lies a warren of low-ceilinged snugs, where log fires and sage armchairs pair well with whisky. The heart of the hotel is an open kitchen, in which chefs fire Galician Blond beef ribs worthy of a T-rex for counterside diners. Alternatively, try the new Mason’s Arms over the road, a coaching inn that’s part of the hotel and serves seasonal dishes like sole with seashore vegetables. When it’s time to sleep off any overindulgence, 19 rooms await, decorated with vintage furniture and patterned wallpaper. Buffet breakfasts are in the sunny Garden Room, a greenery-filled space that also functions as the bar. Rooms: From £200, B & B.",

        "content": "On winter evenings throughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands of starlings gather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.\n\nHow could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.\n\n(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)",

        "content": "Why the Congo Basin appears to be more resilient than the Amazon remains an incredibly complex question, and researchers are looking for answers in the trees. Back at Yangambi, Yakusu leads me down a trail through the surrounding forest and then signals that we should head deeper into the underbrush. As we leave the path, the texture of the ground suddenly changes, crackling softly as dried branches snap beneath our feet and then grow squishy as we step over the soft husk of a decomposing tree trunk. We finally stop in front of a huge tree with a wide, smooth trunk that juts high into the canopy. Part of the mahogany family of trees, it belongs to a particular native species called Entandrophragma utile.\n\nThe tree is part of another long-term survey that’s been happening at the station. To inspect it properly, Yakusu unslings his backpack and produces a wood borer shaped a bit like an oversize corkscrew, placing it against the trunk a few feet above the ground. When he turns the handle, the hardwood seems to resist at first, creaking under the pressure being applied. After a few minutes, Yakusu extracts a long, thin core sample of wood from the inner layers, which he carefully inserts into a protective sleeve. “You have to be careful to not let it break,” he says.\n\nInside the station’s modern wood biology lab—another first in the DRC—researchers would be able to compare the tree’s height and trunk diameter with visible rings from the core sample to determine changes in its growth over time in relation to the climate. “As we’ve demonstrated, the rainforest is warming,” Yakusu says. “This means that the environment in which these trees grow is changing and the conditions for growth are no longer optimal.” In the long run, decreased tree growth could lead to higher tree mortality in the region, one factor responsible for the Amazon’s diminishing capacity to store carbon.\n\nAlready some tree species are disappearing. In the research station’s archives, detailed records on a tree from the same genus, Entandrophragma palustre, show that it was once the most studied species at Yangambi. “But in this forest, you won’t find a single palustre today,” says Yakusu. At the same time, some trees are proving more resistant to extreme climate shifts, which could hold the key to helping the forest adapt. Chadrack Kafuti and Brice Djiofack, two tropical ecologists working at Yangambi’s wood lab, have been closely studying the adaptations of Pericopsis elata, a large-leaved hardwood with the surprising capacity to pause its growth during periods of drought or when sunlight is scarce. That kind of resilience could help direct replanting in areas where the forest has been logged for lumber or affected by wildfires, which are increasingly common.\n\n(Our report on when the Congo Basin reopened to large-scale logging.)",

        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nI was 17 when I had garlic for the first time. I always equate it to The Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy opens the door and the movie is then in colour. My parents were German immigrants, so we ate old-world German-style cuisine. Things like beef stew, chicken schnitzel, potatoes… there was zero spice. Even when we ordered Chinese food, once every three months, it was always the blandest thing on the menu. It wasn’t until I left their house that I had food with flavour. My parents were fantastic in every way, except for food. I’ve spoken to people like Alice Waters, who reinvented the farm-to-table movement [in the US] and she told me her parents were terrible cooks, too! But I’m not a cook, I’m just a fan of food.\n\nI’m exactly like Anthony Bourdain — if he was afraid of everything. That’s what I said to sell Somebody Feed Phil. The idea for it came from my love of food and for shows like Anthony Bourdain’s. I would watch him and think he’s amazing, but I’m never doing that. He’s a lot braver than me, and a pioneer. But then I thought, maybe there’s a show for people like me, who love the idea of travelling, but even just getting off the couch is stepping out of their comfort zone, let alone riding in dune buggies and having a chest tattoo pounded into your skin by Borneo tribes. Bourdain inspired many people to travel, many of whom are way more adventurous than me. But the show is a different take on the travel genre that Bourdain reinvented. I’m following in his footsteps, but in my orthopaedic shoes.\n\nEvery city has a fantastic food scene, especially because every city has immigrants from other places. Some of the best shawarma I’ve ever had was in Glasgow. Why? Because a man from Syria moved to Glasgow and opened a shop. And a lot of Chinese people will tell you, the dishes they made in China taste way better in Los Angeles because of the produce available here. So now they have their brilliant recipes with great ingredients. The immigration and the intermingling of the cultures, that’s what elevates everything.\n\nWhere you are, where you’re sitting, the temperature, the people you’re with, what you’re looking at, what you’re feeling at the time… literally affects your taste. For example, I bet you’ve had wine on holiday and thought, this is the best wine I’ve ever had. You’ve bought a case of that wine and save it for a special occasion. The special occasion comes, you open that wine, and… it’s okay. Maybe the first time you tried it you were falling in love or you were with the person you were going to marry. Everything affects how you perceive everything else.\n\nIn Italy, everywhere is beautiful to me. All the food is delicious and everyone is always hugging and kissing you — what’s not to like? I was once in a little skiing town in Cortina, and I went into this little chalet and asked, “What’s the speciality here?” They said, “Pasta with onions.” That doesn’t sound like much, I thought, but it was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. The onions had been simmering for days until they were sweet and velvety, and mixed in with a touch of cream and herbs. If you have great ingredients, it doesn’t need to be fancy.\n\nI ate ants in Tokyo and they tasted just like lemons. I was at a restaurant called Den, and my companion said I should order the salad, but when it came, it had these big black ants on it. I thought, the restaurant has a problem, call the exterminator! I was very nervous, but I was being filmed and the chef was just across the counter. I bit down and it crunched a little. But you know what? It was like someone put a drop of lemon on my tongue. The chef told me that these particular ants, from a particular part of a particular forest in Japan, taste like lemon. I asked, “Who found this out? Who was the guy who tasted all the ants in the forest and said, ‘Mmm, lemon!’?”\n\nShanghai has a fun food scene I’d love to explore. I’ve seen it depicted in movies and shows, and it looks so great and romantic — t­his big Chinese city with dishes from all over the world. I’ve never been to Greece and I can’t wait to go to Turkey. But the new season is coming out in June, and I go to some places I’ve never been, but I can’t tell you what they are yet!\n\nI went to a Palestinian woman’s restaurant in Dubai and she gave me food that made me cry. The world will tell you that we’re not supposed to be friends, right? I’m a Jewish man, this is a Palestinian lady. We bonded instantly. She was so sweet, warm and lovely — it’s in the show, you can see it. She made a raw lamb dish with all kinds of herbs and spices, from her mother’s recipe. We’ve stayed in touch ever since, all through the troubles.\n\nPhil’s European live tour is taking place until 19 April. Max & Helen’s, his new diner in Los Angeles, opens this spring. Season 8 of Somebody Feed Phil is coming soon.",

        "content": "The river flows vast and soundless. It’s December in southern Kazakhstan, and the landscape near the Syr Darya River is smudged in shades of brown and taupe—dormant grasses, silted floodplains, leafless trees. This is not the most picturesque stretch of riverbank, strewn as it is with food wrappers, bottles, a decomposing sedan. Overhead, the sun is obscured by a haze of coal- and woodsmoke. But when it comes to what Bernie Kuhajda is searching for, the spot feels perfect.\n\n“This is the habitat we need,” says Kuhajda, an aquatic conservation biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. He’s hoping to find a species of sturgeon—the Syr Darya—that’s native to these waters but hasn’t been seen since the 1960s, after a series of Soviet dams was built throughout the river system. Those projects blocked access to the fish’s spawning grounds and forever changed the flow of the Syr Darya, which drains from the high peaks of Kyrgyzstan into what is now the remnants of the Aral Sea. If the sturgeon somehow still exists, Kuhajda thinks this silty, shallow expanse of river is where it can be found.\n\n(Critically endangered sturgeons threatened by proposed dams in Caucasus.)\n\nSome months earlier, Kuhajda had been contacted by the conservation organization Re:Wild, which administers a program to search for what it calls lost species—creatures that haven’t been seen for at least a decade and could be extinct, but there’s not enough data to be conclusive. The officials at Re:Wild reached out to Kuhajda knowing that he was one of a very small collection of scientists who have ever laid eyes on the Syr Darya sturgeon. As a graduate student in the 1990s, he visited museums in London, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and videotaped 27 spindled specimens, bleached white from years of storage. “They said, ‘You’re the expert,’ ” Kuhajda says, remembering the call with Re:Wild. “And I said, ‘Well, I’ve seen them dead in a jar.’ ”",

        "title": "Republicans React to Leaked Trump Officials’ Group Chat",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "A bombshell report that top national security officials for President Donald Trump discussed war plans in a private group chat that accidentally included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic has elicited fierce criticism from Democrats and media commentators who have framed it as a scandal for which heads should roll—but it’s largely been dismissed by a number of Republicans. In a story published on Monday, journalist Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz added him last month to a group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, that also included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Vice President J.D. Vance, and other top national security and White House officials. In the chat, the officials deliberated over an attack on the Houthis in Yemen and Hegseth sent operational details of strikes two hours before bombs dropped.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHegseth has suggested the story is fake, calling Goldberg a “deceitful and highly-discredited ‘so-called journalist.’” But National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes confirmed to Goldberg that the messages “appears to be authentic” and the administration is “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.” When asked about the report on Monday, Trump said “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic.” While Politico reported that some in the administration are furious with Waltz and deliberating whether he should resign or be forced out, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump still has “the utmost confidence in his national security team.” The Atlantic report comes days after the Department of Defense announced an investigation into leaks of sensitive information. The revelation of the leaked group chat set off a flurry of criticism from Democrats, including calls for consequences.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement that Hegseth should resign or be fired: “Hegseth—and everyone else involved—put on a stunning display of recklessness and disregard for our national security,” Martin said. “This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called it the “highest level of f--kup imaginable” in a post on X. “Wait. Pete Hegseth hasn’t resigned yet?” posted California Rep. Eric Swalwell. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth posted that Hegseth “should be fired immediately.” In a statement posted on Threads, Illinois Rep. Jonathan Jackson also called for Hegseth’s resignation, adding that the incident is evidence of the Trump Administration prioritizing “ideological attacks over competence and accountability.”\n\nNew York Times columnist David French, a former Army lawyer and self-described evangelical conservative who is a frequent critic of Trump, wrote: “There is not an officer alive whose career would survive a security breach like that.” French suggested that the breach, if committed by another officer, could even be investigated as potentially criminal and that “Nothing destroys a leader’s credibility with soldiers more thoroughly than hypocrisy or double standards. … If [Hegseth] had any honor at all, he would resign.” But some Republicans in Congress, which is meant to act as a check on and exercise oversight of the executive branch, have largely downplayed the incident, offering mild criticism if any. “A mistake was made. It happens,” Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy told reporters, adding that it’s “not keeping the American people up at night. … Trust me, this is not going to lead to the apocalypse.” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said on Fox News: “This is what the leftist media is reduced to ... now we’re griping about who’s on a text message and who’s not. I mean, come on.” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said, “You got to know who you’re sending your text to,” but he also told reporters “it’s a 24-hour news cycle. … I’ve got a lot of confidence in Mike [Waltz]. This doesn’t undermine my belief that he’s a solid pick for the role.” Florida Sen. Rick Scott expressed similarly tepid concerns: “Clearly, they’ve got to, you know, make sure that they’re careful how they do this,” he told reporters when asked about the group chat.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the incident warranted “some kind of internal investigation” to “make corrections,” but Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said a congressional investigation wasn’t needed: “You can’t put just blame on just one person, other than the fact that the person in charge, that the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, he’ll get it corrected. And you know, that’s just part of transition and growing,” Tuberville told CNN. Florida Rep. Brian Mast, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, seemed to echo Tuberville’s sentiment, telling reporters that the issue “wasn’t a systemic thing” and didn’t require a “special investigation.” South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds added that he expected Democrats to raise the incident during an intelligence hearing on Tuesday, and that “some of my Republican colleagues may raise it just as an issue to be very concerned about.” Gabbard and Ratcliffe are among those who were already due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters it was an issue of “systems and process, not personnel,” suggesting that disciplinary action against anyone involved in the chat would be the wrong move. “The administration is addressing what happened,” Johnson said. “Apparently an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They’re gonna track that down and make sure that doesn’t happen again. … Clearly, I think the administration has acknowledged it was a mistake and they’ll tighten up and make sure it doesn’t happen again.” Still, the breach seems to have shaken up many others in the party. Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon spelled out the national security implications of the gaffe, telling reporters, “everybody makes mistakes, texting somebody, we’ve all done it. But you don’t put classified information on unclassified devices like Signal. And there’s no doubt, I’m an intelligence guy, Russia and China are monitoring both their phones, right. So putting out classified information like that endangers our forces, and I can’t believe that they were knowingly putting that kind of classified information on unclassified systems, it’s just wrong.” Texas Sen. John Cornyn said it “sounds like a huge screw up. I mean is there any other way to describe it? I don’t think you should use Signal for classified information.” And New York Rep. Mike Lawler posted on X: “Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels—and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period.”\n\n“We’re just finding out about it. But obviously, we’ve got to run it to ground and figure out what went on there. We’ll have a plan,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters the committee “will be looking into this.” “It’s definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made,” Wicker added, but he said that whether someone should be held accountable depended on the results of an investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Maine Sen. Susan Collins reportedly called the incident an “extremely troubling and serious matter”; Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told a HuffPost reporter, “there needs to be some accountability”; and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy put it most bluntly: “Well, somebody f--ked up.”\n\n—Chad de Guzman contributed reporting.",

        "title": "The Race to Explain Why More Young Adults Are Getting Cancer",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face.\n\nWhen I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point.\n\nAfter her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.”\n\nThe 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "title": "No, Your Email Doesn’t Find Me Well. Why Everyone Is So Tired of Work",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "\"I hope this email finds you well.\" It’s a phrase that lands in inboxes every day—but let’s be honest, how many of us actually feel well? Across industries, burnout and disengagement have become the defining crises of the modern workforce, leaving leaders and employees alike wondering: why is everyone so exhausted? Even those of us who specialize in workplace wellbeing haven’t been immune to the toll. The question isn’t just what’s happening—it’s how we got here and, more importantly, how we fix it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs Industrial-Organizational Psychologists who have studied workplace wellness for decades, we have our theories. We wondered if organizational wellness solutions were misaligned with employee needs or expectations. We also considered whether many companies were following wellness fads or trends without evidence that they actually drive results. But we didn’t only want to know the answer; we also wanted to find solutions. We interviewed and surveyed hundreds of employees to better understand how leaders can take action to improve employee, team, and organizational wellness. What we found was surprising—but also provides clear pathways forward for solving the persistent problem of workplace burnout. First, we found that workplace wellness isn’t what most companies think it is. Step challenges, mindfulness workshops, pizza parties, and lunchtime yoga sessions might look good on paper, but they’re hardly moving the needle. While these programs can make a difference for the few employees who have the time—or energy—to participate, the majority remain stuck in a cycle of overload: too many responsibilities, toxic work environments, and a culture that expects them to be “on” around the clock.\n\nSo, what’s the real secret to keeping employees well, energized, and productive? Surprisingly, it has little to do with perks, and everything to do with leadership. When we spoke to employees thriving in their roles, one factor stood out: their leader’s behavior. More specifically, after rigorously analyzing over a thousand pages of interview transcripts and open-ended survey responses gathered from hundreds of employees, we found that participants almost unanimously reported that their leader—not a wellness program or initiative—was integral to driving their health and well-being at work. The evidence is clear—if organizations want to boost engagement and performance, they need to stop focusing on quick-fix wellness programs and start investing in better leadership. Read More: The Plague of Mediocre Leadership Our research revealed core strategies that set exceptional leaders—whom we call “Generators”—apart. These leaders consistently drive results without burning out their teams or themselves. One of their most impactful strategies? Vulnerability and authenticity.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but employees aren’t looking for superhero leaders. They want real people—leaders who show up as their true selves, flaws and all. This kind of authenticity builds trust, and trust creates an environment where employees feel safe sharing their challenges. With that openness comes an opportunity for meaningful support. When employees get the help they need, they tackle real problems and genuine solutions emerge. Productivity follows in due course. Consider a personal example of a Generator in action. Early in my career, I (Patricia) had the privilege of working for Jill, a leader who embodied the Generator mindset. I had just started in a high-pressure, client-facing role that required frequent travel and presenting to executives. The onboarding process was intense, with rigorous training focused on presentation skills—complete with nerve-wracking practice sessions and relentless feedback.\n\nJill prepared me for it in a way that stuck with me. She shared her own struggles during presentation training, admitting she hadn’t been a natural at first either. Her openness made all the difference. Instead of feeling overwhelmed or defeated, I trusted her enough to be honest about where I was struggling. That trust created a space where I could improve faster than I ever expected. Jill’s vulnerability wasn’t a weakness; it was the key to unlocking my potential. Another strategy Generators deploy is supporting employees as individuals with unique needs and personal lives. They see employees as whole people and work to build quick relationships to understand their needs. As part of that, they serve as boundary bouncers—helping employees set boundaries important to them, enforcing those boundaries, and blocking employees from people or situations that violate their boundaries. Going back to Jill, she did a great job of supporting each of the team member’s needs and being a boundary bouncer. I distinctly remember a situation where a client needed someone to come onsite and the person assigned to the account was unable to go. I raised my hand and told Jill that I was happy to help and step in - since I didn’t have kids, I figured I had less responsibility than my colleagues and should volunteer. Jill took me aside and told me that my personal boundaries and needs mattered just as much as those who have kids. She said I could, of course, step in to help if I actually had the time. But she also urged me to stick to my own boundaries.\n\nAfter that conversation, I really thought about my boundaries, shared them with her, and we worked together to protect them. Jill saw me as a whole person with a valuable personal life that deserved protection.\n\nFrom our research and our personal experience, we can confidently say that these types of behaviors truly support employee wellness while leading to great results. Our study participants all shared that they worked harder with better leadership, and that investing in leaders isn’t just good for wellness—it’s good for business.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has made good on his promise of revoking security clearance for former President Joe Biden. Issued late on Friday night, a memo titled “Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified Information from Specified Individuals” laid out Trump’s instructions for Biden, several members of the Biden Administration, and other political rivals to have their security clearances rescinded. Trump determined it was “no longer in the national interest” for said individuals to still hold “any active security clearance” or “unescorted” access to government facilities. “This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals’ previous tenure in the Congress,” the memo reads.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead More: Schumer Says He’s 'Not Stepping Down,' Calls Trump a 'Lawless, Angry Man' The action was applied to Biden and “any other member of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family.” Joining the former President on the list was his former Vice President, and Trump’s one-time opponent in the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris. Trump’s 2016 opponent and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also listed, alongside former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan, and former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. In addition, New York Attorney General Letitia James and the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg—both of whom prosecuted Trump—as well as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger—Republicans and former Representatives who served on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—were added to the list of people who will have such privileges rescinded.\n\nThe memo also includes whistleblower lawyer Mark Zaid and Fiona Hill, Trump’s former Russia analyst who testified during Trump’s first impeachment hearing. Norman Eisen, an attorney leading various lawsuits against the Trump Administration, also joined attorney Andrew Weissmann and Alexander Vindman, the former Director for European Affairs for the National Security Council, on the list. Read More: Is Trump Set to Impose a New Travel Ban? Here Are the Countries That Could Be at Risk In an emailed statement sent to TIME, Zaid says: “There are many of us who will not be bullied or intimidated, notwithstanding the continued attacks on lawyers.” “Lawyers are the first line of defense against authoritarianism, which is why Shakespeare's “Dick the Butcher” [character] wants to kill us in Henry VI [Part 2]” he says. “It looks like President Trump has found a more effective way of eliminating those he fears might challenge him.”\n\nAccording to Congress, there are three different levels of security clearance: “Confidential,” “Secret,” and “Top Secret.” Former Presidents and other previously-serving officials are often given access to classified information as a courtesy, even after they leave office. In 2021, though, Biden took away Trump’s security clearance—citing what he said was Trump’s “erratic behavior” around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Trump had earlier announced his intention to revoke Biden’s security clearance on Feb. 7, posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, about his decision. \"There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s Security Clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings,” Trump said. “I will always protect our National Security — JOE, YOU'RE FIRED.” Meanwhile, on March 17, Trump announced he was revoking Secret Service protection for Biden’s adult children, and earlier this year, the Administration reportedly took away security details for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nBrooklyn Law School professor Heidi Gilchrist, a former CIA analyst and expert on national security, says that for some in government, losing security clearance means “losing your livelihood,” and government officials may well begin thinking about the potential political fallout of their actions with the President.\n\nShe notes that Trump does have “broad authority” as President to revoke clearances, but believes that there is a “strong argument here” that the First Amendment is being violated by revoking clearance for political opponents. In fact, she believes there may even be an “opening” for the courts to get involved.\n\n“Courts generally will not review security clearance decisions, as they just defer to the executive branch in matters of national security,” Gilchrist says. “But this [instance] is not based on any sort of national security expertise or rationale… this could be a clear opening for courts to review clearance decisions which they've stayed away from in the past.”",

        "title": "This Tech Hack Can Help You Communicate More Efficiently",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In today’s fast-paced world, many of us rush to deliver our messages without taking the time to tailor or test them. At work, we rely on boilerplate presentations, or “Frankendecks,” consisting of slides we have “borrowed” from previous presentations or hastily composed emails and memos that lack focus and relevance. This approach leads to confusion, lost engagement, missed opportunities, and a lot of time cleaning up the mess of misunderstandings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, the tech industry can teach us a way to predictably increase the fidelity of how we communicate while remaining time efficient. Just as product designers use the Minimally Viable Product (MVP) approach to quickly test, refine, and improve their offerings, we can apply similar principles to communication. The concept of MVP emphasizes launching a simplified version of a product to test its core value with real users. Similarly, we can leverage Minimally Viable Communication (MVC) to generate and iterate on meaningful, memorable messages that are audience-centric and clear. Imagine opening a bakery with a dream of crafting elaborate wedding cakes. The MVP approach would recommend starting small with mini cupcakes. After all, cupcakes are less time-intensive, more cost-effective, and easier for customers to sample and give feedback on—and feedback is invaluable for a new business. Learning what works and what doesn't early can direct potential improvements before diving into larger, resource-intensive efforts (like wedding cakes).\n\nMVC works the same way. Rather than crafting the full message from the start, we develop a “minimally viable” version to gauge audience reaction, gather insights, and iterate. By aligning our communication steps with those of MVP, we ensure our messages are clear, effective, and relevant. Here’s how the key steps of MVP map onto MVC, providing a framework for impactful communication. Minimally Viable Product and Minimally Viable Communication Several parallels can be found between product development and message development. Both journeys begin with user understanding, which translates to audience insight in the realm of MVC. Just as the MVP framework focuses on assessing user needs to ensure relevance, an MVC framework starts by getting to know the audience’s knowledge, attitudes, concerns, and expectations. This MVC structure then employs clear message structures such as “Problem-Solution-Benefit” or “What-So What-Now What” formats, which help communicate core ideas without overwhelming the audience.\n\nMVC thinking also emphasizes context awareness to ensure the message we communicate fits the setting we are communicating in. In business, market analysis, a staple of MVP, shapes product timing and scope, whereas context awareness involves considering timing, the most effective communication channel for delivery, and messaging sequence. To measure the success of these efforts, MVC should have a clear, succinct goal of ideal audience impact—similar to how MVP measures achievements through predefined metrics. The best way to focus messaging from the beginning (and assess its impact at the end) is to establish what audiences should know, feel, and do with the information. Finally, the iterative process, which is crucial when considering MVP, also applies to the MVC framework. Just as MVP thinking helps tech teams refine their offerings based on feedback, MVC thinking helps us adapt our messages through audience input, allowing for continual refinement that enhances clarity and impact.\n\nThe MVC process consists of five steps. Step 1: Audience insight The most common mistake in communication is starting from a place of \"What do I want to say?\" rather than \"What does my audience need to hear?\" Just as product developers rely on user data to understand preferences and pain points, prioritizing MVC requires reconnaissance, reflection, and research. Through this process, there are several critical audience questions to consider: Are you addressing an audience that’s well-versed or completely new to your topic? Adjust your language and approach accordingly. Starting too broad or going too deep too quickly can lead to confusion or boredom.\n\n\n\nIs your audience inclined to support or oppose your message? Acknowledge your audience’s position and build from there. Tailor your content based on whether you need to influence, inform, or inspire them to move in your direction.\n\n\n\nWhat barriers might your audience face in accepting your message? Perhaps they are concerned about cost, time, or effort. Everything they hear or read from you is filtered through these concerns, so take these hesitations seriously. Acknowledge and address them thoroughly and empathetically—avoid dismissing them outright.\n\n\n\nWhat drives your audience? Are there specific goals or values you can tap into? Call out and link your message to what they care about. This should increase engagement, retention, and willingness to act.\n\nStep 2: Context awareness In MVP design, context may involve market timing, competition, fit, and delivery channels. In MVC design, context includes factors like timing, channel, and sequence. Consider, for example, how people tend to be more collaborative in the morning due to higher dopamine and serotonin levels. In contrast, by late afternoon, energy and attention can wane. Keep this in mind, and plan any collaborative sessions for when your audience will be most engaged.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, think about what your audience may have encountered before your message. If they just received bad news, they could be less receptive. Just as you’d be mindful of the market environment when launching a product, consider the sequence in which your message will be received to ensure optimal impact. Step 3: Communication goal Effective communication needs a goal, just as a product needs a purpose. With the MVC method, goals are composed of three components: information, emotion, and action.\n\nIn turn, these three variables help us answer three questions: What do I want my audience to know? How do I want them to feel? What do I want them to do? Setting a clear goal not only keeps your communication focused but also provides a benchmark for success. When your audience \"knows,\" \"feels,\" and \"does\" what you intended, you have succeeded. Step 4: Message structure Much like a product wireframe or a process framework, MVC uses a clear structure to enhance understanding, retention, and fidelity. Many message structures exist. One effective structure is known as the “What, So What, Now What” structure. The “What” is your main point which you should start with. What are you trying to convey? The “So what” of your message should communicate why your message matters. This is the relevance and salience for your audience. And finally, the “Now what” of your message should convey the next steps. This is where you add momentum, driving next steps and action from your message.\n\nLike all structures, the “What, So What, Now What” structure can help keep your message organized, concise, and memorable. And when you communicate in a structured way, you make it easier for your audience to digest your message. Step 5: Feedback and iteration Both MVP and MVC frameworks rely on feedback to refine and hone their results. In product design, prototypes are created to be tested and improved upon. Similarly, the MVC method takes the initial structures and tests them. Quick ways to gain feedback might include sharing an early draft, conducting a brief poll to gauge reactions, or getting insights from generative AI. When we rush communication, we risk costly misinterpretations that require a lot of effort and time to correct. Being purposeful and process-focused upfront can prevent misunderstandings and save time in the long run. Feedback also helps us adapt to different audience needs, allowing us to optimize the \"user experience\" of our message.\n\nThe five steps of MVC —audience, context, goal, structure, and feedback—provide a powerful process for crafting focused, audience-centered communication. By applying the iterative principles of MVC, we create clarity and relevance, and enhance remembering. Our tailored messages are more likely to cut through the clutter and have an impact.",

        "content": "The genetic testing and information company, 23andMe, announced on March 23 that it has filed for bankruptcy, after years of financial struggles and data privacy concerns. Filing for bankruptcy will allow the company “to facilitate a sale process to maximize the value of its business,” 23andMe said in a press release. The news also comes amid management changes; according to the press release, Chief Executive Officer Anne Wojcicki is stepping down from her role, effective immediately, but will continue to serve as a board member. The company’s board selected Chief Financial and Accounting Officer Joe Selsavage to serve as the interim CEO.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the press release, 23andMe said it “intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the sale process. There are no changes to the way the Company stores, manages, or protects customer data.” “We are committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction,” Mark Jensen, chair and member of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, said in the press release. Still, some officials are urging customers to consider deleting their data. Just a few days before the bankruptcy announcement, on March 21, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a consumer alert to 23andMe customers, advising them to consider deleting their data from the company’s website. “Given 23andMe’s reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” Bonta said in a press release.\n\nRead More: Want to Live Long? Lifestyle Matters More Than Genes Some technology experts also encouraged 23andMe users to delete their data. Meredith Whittaker, the president of the messaging app Signal, said in a post on X: \"It's not just you. If anyone in your FAMILY gave their DNA to 23&me, for all of your sakes, close your/their account now. This won't solve the issue, but they will (they claim) delete some of your data.\" In October 2024, NPR reported on customers' concerns over what could happen to their private data amid the company's financial challenges. A 23andMe spokesperson told NPR that the company was committed to privacy, but wouldn't answer questions about what the company might do with customer data. Legal experts said that there are few federal protections for customers, and worried that the sensitive data could potentially be sold off or even accessed by law enforcement, NPR reported.\n\nThe California Attorney General’s Office outlined in its press release on March 21 the steps customers need to take to delete their genetic data from 23andMe: After logging into your account, click on “Settings” and scroll to the bottom of the page to a section called “23andMe Data”; click “View”; then you can download your data; scroll to the “Delete Data” section and click “Permanently Delete Data.” You’ll receive an email from 23andMe after that, and you can follow the link in the email to confirm your request to delete your data. If you had previously allowed 23andMe to store a saliva sample and DNA, you can change that preference by going to the “Settings” page on your account, under “Preferences.” If you had previously allowed 23andMe and third-party researchers to use your genetic data and sample for research purposes, you can also revoke that consent from the “Settings” page, under “Research and Product Consents.”\n\nIn addition to years of financial challenges, 23andMe dealt with the fallout from a data breach in 2023 that affected almost 7 million customers.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

We asked several former TIME editors-in-chief how they remember their time working with D.W.\n\nEdward Felsenthal\n\nD.W. is far more than TIME’s creative director—though of course that’s no small job in itself. He’s a maestro of visual storytelling who has played an integral role in TIME’s transformation. As its name implies, TIME is not static. It’s constantly evolving to reflect the world it chronicles. And in an era of instant news, vastly altering the role of a magazine, D.W. has been instrumental in ensuring TIME’s enduring impact.\n\nYou can see that in the almost magical ambition he brings to what’s possible in a small print or digital frame—like the public artist JR’s Guns in America cover, which brought together 245 people on all sides of the gun debate—and then off the page in the form of a multimedia experience that traveled the country. Or Japanese artist Toshihiko Hosaka’s How Earth Survived, a life-size sand sculpture created over 14 days to convey the shared work of addressing climate change. Or replacing the TIME logo —for the very first time—with the word vote ahead of the 2020 presidential election on a Shepard Fairey image, under-scoring the imperative to exercise our democratic right.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's nominee to be ambassador to Israel will face a confirmation hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill as U.S. and Arab mediators struggle to get a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas back on track after Israeli forces resumed the war in Gaza last week with a surprise wave of deadly airstrikes. Trump nominated Mike Huckabee, a well-known evangelical Christian and vehement supporter of Israel, to take on the critical post in Jerusalem days after he won reelection on a campaign promise to end the now 17-month war.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf Huckabee, a Republican, is confirmed by the Senate, his posting will likely complicate an already unstable situation in the Middle East as the former governor of Arkansas has taken stances on the conflict that sharply contradict longstanding U.S. policy in the region. Huckabee, a one-time presidential hopeful, has spoken favorably in the past about Israel’s right to annex the West Bank and incorporate its Palestinian population into Israel. He has repeatedly backed referring to the West Bank by its biblical name of “Judea and Samaria,” a term that right-wing Israeli politicians and activists have thus far fruitlessly pushed the U.S. to accept. Most notably, Huckabee has long been opposed to the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian people. In an interview last year, he went even further, saying that he doesn't even believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as “Palestinians.”\n\n“There really isn’t such a thing,” he said on the podcast show “Think Twice” with Jonathan Tobin. “It’s a term that was co-opted by Yasser Arafat in 1962,” referring to one of the early leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization. During the same interview, Huckabee described himself as an “unapologetic, unreformed Zionist.” As the situation in Gaza has deteriorated with the recent collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli officials have begun to talk more seriously about re-occupation of the territory, something to which the Biden administration had been adamantly opposed. Trump has made his own proposals about a potential U.S. takeover of Gaza, which have attracted attention as well as strong criticism from Arab nations and others. Huckabee will likely be asked about all of these points in addition to ongoing Israeli military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon and persistent threats to the country from Iran and Iranian-backed proxy groups, like the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nIn remarks prepared for his testimony, obtained by The Associated Press, Huckabee does not specifically mention either annexation or Trump’s Gaza plan. But he can be expected to offer qualified praise of both, given that he blasts many past Mideast policies as “failed” and speaks of the need to look “at entirely new ways” of promoting peace. He plans to reaffirm his strong endorsement of Trump's policies toward Israel during his first term in office, notably his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, his decision to move the U.S. embassy to the holy city from Tel Aviv, his recognition of the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory and his sealing of the Abraham Accords, in which several Arab nations normalized relations with Israel, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. “President Trump’s first term was the most consequential for Israel and the Middle East ever with his historic Abraham Accords, and finally moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the ancient, indigenous and biblical eternal capital of the Jewish people,” Huckabee’s prepared remarks say.\n\nTrump's pick for ambassador to Panama also testifying Another nominee testifying before the committee on Tuesday is Kevin Cabrera, Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Panama, a country that has bristled at the Republican president’s repeated calls for the U.S. to retake control of the Panama Canal for national security reasons due to potential threats from China. The status of the canal was one of the top items on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s agenda when he visited Panama City on his first trip as America's top diplomat in February. “One of the key aspects of our cooperation is ensuring the security of the Panama Canal, a critical international waterway that facilitates global trade and economic growth,” Cabrera will say according to remarks prepared for the hearing. He plans to praise decisions by the Panamanian government to withdraw from China’s Belt and Road Initiative and to review contracts with a China-based company that is running ports at both ends of the canal. The company has preliminarily agreed to sell its interests in the subsidiaries that run the ports, but the deal is not yet complete.\n\n___\n\nAmiri reported from New York.",

        "title": "AI May Make it Even Harder to Find a Job",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Entering 2025, underlying the calm surface of the U.S. labor market were currents of anxiety, dissatisfaction, and stagnation. Companies were taking longer to fill open roles, and a growing numbers of employees were disengaged but staying in their roles out of concern it would be difficult to find something better. Now, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their Department of Government Efficiency have laid off thousands of federal employees. These workers are now re-entering the job market. Plus, companies and employees alike are trying to anticipate the impact of rollicking financial markets thanks to constant changes in tariffs. This economic tumult is bringing the stormy currents of the labor market to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the face of these challenges, many job seekers are turning to new AI-powered apps meant to help them find jobs. But ironically, these tools are likely to exacerbate the present challenges and make it harder, not easier, to find jobs. To understand why AI tools designed to help individuals apply to jobs will make the job market more challenging to navigate, it helps to understand the history of those tools and how companies actually hire people today. AI isn’t a new phenomenon in the job-application process. Its mainstream use began on the employer side when companies deployed AI-powered tools in the 2010s to filter through the hundreds of job applications they were receiving for open online job postings. The AI tools baked into these applicant tracking systems—software that companies use to manage the hiring process—looked for matches between the words on incoming resumes and those in job descriptions. If there was enough of a match, then a job seeker’s resume likely made it through the filter.\n\nOn its face, this seemed to offer an advantage to companies over job seekers. In reality, although companies did use these tools to winnow their hiring funnels, most actual hires weren’t made from the pool of people applying online without a connection to the hiring manager. Instead, despite the democratization of job postings online, estimates suggest that well over half of jobs—and perhaps as high as 85%—are still found through personal connections. This is due in no small part to a lack of trust that job seekers and companies have in each other when interacting online. Online job descriptions today have become a long list of skills, qualifications, and platitudes about work style and culture cribbed from past job descriptions, competitors’ postings, and requirements for pay and title grading at the desired level of the role. They have become so vague and meaningless that roles can be impossible to fill as described. Think of the myriad entry-level postings that call for “two years of experience,” for example. Or all the job descriptions that require college degrees—even when current employees in the same roles lack them. Indeed, if you peruse enough job postings, you sometimes get the feeling that employers are seeking employees who do not exist.\n\nSimultaneously, as AI-powered applicant tracking systems sort out individuals that don’t match the desired skills, experiences, and characteristics listed in these job descriptions, prospective employees have learned to embellish their resume and make themselves look like superheroes. In order to get past AI-powered gatekeepers, it has become common for applicants to exaggerate their experiences. This cycle has generated mistrust in the resumes and cover letters coming in from the internet. As a result, managers often prefer to source candidates through a referral they can trust from someone they know. Sure, that might mean it takes longer to fill open roles. But the delay can be worth it from a company’s perspective if it results in a better match. The consequence of this dynamic is that as job seekers begin using AI tools to apply to jobs online, it’s unlikely to help them. It’s actually likely to send the job market into an AI-driven hiring doom loop—the result of which will be employers relying on their personal networks for hiring even more.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Canva, 45% of global job seekers use AI to create and fine-tune their resumes and cover letters. And a growing number of job seekers are doing something more radical: They are using AI-powered tools like LazyApply and JobCopilot to apply directly to open jobs on their behalf. But unfortunately, positive experiences with these AI-powered apps tend to be the exception, not the rule. As more job seekers leverage these automated application tools, it may become even more difficult for job seekers to find a job online because they will flood hiring managers with more applications than they could ever consider. Employers that were receiving hundreds of applications for open roles already tell us that they now receive thousands. With even less trust in the AI-tailored resumes pouring in, companies are likely to rely on personal connections even more to help them find employees.\n\nHiring processes that overly rely on personal connections creates problems—both for companies and job seekers. Companies seeking to boost the diversity of their funnel by gathering large numbers of applicants will likely continue to end up with new hires in similar social circles as their existing employees. Network-based hiring has downsides for job seekers as well. If getting a job is all about who you know, those with limited networks are often left out. As Harvard University’s Raj Chetty’s Opportunity Insights research has shown, networks are strongly based in class—particularly at the top. This means that individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds often have significantly fewer high-income connections. And given the number of jobs filled by who you know, that means that low-income Americans are less connected to higher paying opportunities in the workforce. If these personal connections become even more important when looking for a job, individuals must beef up their networks—not just on social media or with AI bots, but in real life.\n\nTo be sure, networking can “feel dirty,” but as AI makes the job search process more difficult, it will be increasingly critical. So what to do? Rather than connecting with a potential member of your network with the explicit goal of asking for a job, make a habit of being curious about the work other professionals do. Talk with people who hold roles that interest you to learn about what they do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis. The focus, in other words, should be about learning and growth. Over time, you will expand your network and learn about the roles that are good fits for you, your unique skills and experience, and the types of work that energize you. The goal should be to become a self-aware individual who understands what opportunities are out there, recognizes what they bring to the table, and demonstrates real interest in others. That will, in turn, set you apart as someone worth recommending by those that others trust—which is something AI can’t do.\n\nMichael B.

        "content": "What a difference mere weeks have made in Canada. As the new year came and went, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ruling Liberal Party, after nearly a decade in power, were trailing the Conservatives by 25 points—and facing electoral oblivion. An election was due by fall. It was looking like it might come earlier. The opposition parties in the House of Commons were working to bring down the government. Today, Canada is in the midst of that early election, but the circumstances are night and day. Trudeau is gone, replaced by former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. And it was Carney himself who called a snap election for April 28. Most surprising of all, the Liberals are back up in the polls—and now favored to win. And it’s all thanks to a brash American in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe last three months have embodied the old maxim that “events, dear boy, events” can upset the odds in short order. After Donald Trump was elected in November, Canadians became nervous about what his second term might mean for the country. That it wouldn’t be anything good was obvious as early as December when Trump bullied Trudeau, vowed sweeping tariffs, and even threatened annexation to make Canada the “cherished 51st state.” With Trump’s taunts, the pressure on the highly unpopular Trudeau to step aside only grew. Canada needed a new, full-time and focused leader, with plenty of runway to deal with Trump and his bid for hemispheric dominance. So Trudeau announced his resignation on Jan. 6, the date Trump’s win was certified. A short Liberal leadership race followed in March, and Carney became Prime Minister. On Sunday, he called a snap election as voters are rallying around the flag and the incumbent Liberals, and against the Yankee menace.\n\nWith Canada’s economy, defense, and even sovereignty on the line, it’s no surprise that the election is about Trump and who can best handle him—and how. But it’s still a shock to witness the ultra-rapid revival of a Liberal Party that was written off as moribund not so long ago.\n\nIf the Liberals do indeed survive and hold on to power come April 28, they will have Trump to thank—but they’ll also have him to deal with.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Warning: Spoilers ahead for Severance Ever since Helly and Mark stumbled upon a room filled with goats in Season 1 of Severance, fans have been wondering why Lumon is raising these animals in their walls. In the Season 2 finale, we finally get an answer. The goats are being raised for ritual sacrifice. Grim, we know. Earlier this season, Severance introduced Gwendoline Christie's Lorne, the head Goat Herder (unclear if that's her official title) in a department called Mammalians Nurturable. In Episode 3, Helly and Mark return to the goat room while searching for Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) and learn that the humans in the walled-in pasture are a particularly feral bunch of innies who are extremely protective of their flock.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLorne returns at the end of Season 2, when she brings a baby goat (named Emile! Cute!) to Mr. Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), the imposing Kier acolyte who spars with both Helena (Britt Lower) and Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) in the outie world. \"Mammalians Nurturable brings an offering,\" says Lorne, as she ushers in the adorable goat. \"Has it verve?\" asks Mr. Drummond. \"It does.\" \"Wiles?\" \"The most of its flock.\" \"This beast will be entombed with a cherished woman whose spirit it must guide to Kier's door. Is it up to the task?\" \"It is.\" At this point Mr. Drummond pulls out a gun. So, yes, the goats are being killed as part of Kier's bizarre religion to which the severed people in Mammalians Nurturable apparently adhere.\n\nSeverance's Adam Scott and Britt Lower Discuss On Major Season 2 Episode\n\nLike most revelations in Severance, learning about the fate of the goats only raises more questions about Lumon, its strange cult, and its ultimate objective. Why do they have to kill the goal with a gun? It seems there would be less cruel ways to carry out the sacrifice. Even assuming the Egans don't care about animal cruelty, there must be less risky ways to carry out the sacrifice just in case, I don't know, the innie to whom you hand the gun decides to rebel. And why is this sacrifice only taking place in front of one person? Isn't the point of ritual sacrifice for it to be performed in front of adherents to the religion as a twisted bonding experience and proof of faith in the higher power? For that matter, why would Lumon program a group of innies to care deeply about these baby goats they have to sacrificially kill? Wouldn't that seed resentment and the beginnings of the exact rebellion that takes place?\n\nAs she prepares to kill the baby goat, Lorne asks, \"How many more must I give?\" Her question implies that many baby goats have died before this one. Does that mean that Lumon has been experimenting on many more people the way they have been experimenting on Gemma? Or do they bury every innie who dies in Lumon with a goat? How many have there been? Do people not notice mass disappearances of Lumon employees?\n\nAnyway, this all seems like a major distraction for Mr. Drummond, whose real work is completing the Cold Harbor project. He ought to be off perfecting the science of severance by ensuring Gemma cannot feel a trace of her real-world trauma as she deconstructs a crib identical to the one she built for the child she and Mark never had. Pulling off that experiment—which is apparently so important that Lumon's entire future depends on its outcome—seems slightly more important than overseeing the murder of a goat.",

        "title": "South Africa Leader Says Persecution of Whites 'False Narrative'",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday the claim that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative.” It was his latest attempt to push back against allegations made by U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and some white minority groups in South Africa. South African-born Musk, who has regularly accused South Africa's Black-led government of being anti-white, repeated a claim this weekend in a social media post that some of the country's political figures are “actively promoting white genocide.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRamaphosa said in his weekly message to the nation that South Africans “should not allow events beyond our shores to divide us or turn us against each other.” “In particular, we should challenge the completely false narrative that our country is a place in which people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution.” Ramaphosa did not mention names, but his denial was a reference to the allegations by Trump and others that South Africa is deliberately mistreating a white minority group known as Afrikaners by encouraging violent attacks on their farms and introducing a law designed to seize their land. The allegations were central to an executive order issued by Trump last month cutting funding to South Africa to punish the government, while offering Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. Afrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa more than 300 years ago. They were at the heart of the apartheid government that systematically oppressed non-whites, although South Africa has been largely successful at reconciling its many racial groups after apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn his post on X, influential Trump adviser Musk cited a political rally last Friday in South Africa where Black leaders of a far-left opposition party sang a song that has the lyrics “Kill the Boer, the farmer.” Boer is a word that refers to an Afrikaner. “Very few people know that there is a major political party in South Africa that is actively promoting white genocide,” Musk wrote. He linked to a video of the rally. Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X late Monday that the song “is a chant that incites violence. South Africa’s leaders and politicians must take action to protect Afrikaner and other disfavored minorities. The United States is proud to offer those individuals who qualify for admission to our nation amid this continued horrible threat of violence.” The party in question, the Economic Freedom Fighters, is the fourth biggest in Parliament and a political opponent of Ramaphosa's African National Congress. It won 9.5% of the vote in last year's national election. It has come under scrutiny for stirring racial tensions before and for singing the song, which was used during apartheid as a call to fight against government oppression.\n\nThe song's modern-day use has been criticized by some in South Africa, including by other political parties, and a group representing Afrikaners challenged its use in court. It was ruled hate speech and effectively banned by a court more than a decade ago. But it was the subject of several other legal cases before a 2022 ruling found that it was not hate speech and protected under freedom of speech because there was no proof it incited violence. The EFF says it is a historic chant that shouldn’t be taken literally and has sometimes changed the lyrics to \"kiss the Boer.\" Since Trump's executive order, the South African government has sought to dispel what it says is misinformation over white farmers, who are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes. The government has condemned the attacks, but experts say there is no evidence of any widespread targeting of whites and they are in fact part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates, which affect all races.\n\nThe group representing Afrikaners says the police have sometimes undercounted farm homicides in official statistics. It recently said it had figures showing there were eight farm homicides in the three-month period between October and December last year when police only recorded one.\n\nThere were a total of 6,953 homicides across South Africa during that same time period, according to the police statistics.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Why You Should Write Your Own Eulogy",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Have you ever lost a loved one who left important words unsaid? Did you wonder if they really loved you, or did you have an argument with them right before they died? As a hospice nurse and the founder of Doulagivers Institute, and as someone who has been at the bedside of over 1,000 dying patients, I know how important it is to say everything you need to say at the end of life. That’s why I recommend that everyone, young and old, sick or healthy, write their own eulogy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday, many are rethinking what a funeral service needs to look like. Some are looking back to older traditions by readopting the practice of home wakes and funerals. Others are creating new traditions, showing that there are so many more ways to celebrate a life well-lived than the conventional options. Turning the traditional eulogy into a personally written goodbye can be an empowering and beautiful way to say “I love you” one more time. A eulogy is usually a heartfelt tribute that someone else delivers at the funeral or memorial service. Sometimes, it’s a family member or close friend, but often, it’s a clergy member who may not even know us well. As a death doula, I’ve attended many funerals. But I have never felt more love and healing at one than when a first-person eulogy is read. It’s powerful. Everyone in the room feels they get to have one last conversation with the person they’ve lost. When that conversation is filled with love, it’s the best possible salve for grief. It doesn’t mean others can’t say their own eulogies, but there’s something special about hearing directly from the person everyone misses so much.\n\nRead More: What a Hospice Nurse Wants You to Know About Death When you write your own eulogy to be read after you’re gone, it’s wonderful to know that you’ve left behind a message for everyone you love to help them get through the loss. Even if you aren’t ill and even if you’re still young, you will feel a sense of relief in knowing your eulogy is ready just in case. Of course, none of us wants to think about our death. It can be scary. But I've learned that we can release some of that fear by taking back our control—when we take care of our final plans in advance, we can feel more at ease and at peace, rather than afraid of the unknown. It can also be an opportunity to communicate life lessons you’ve amassed along the way, especially if you’re leaving behind young children or grandchildren. I know someone who wrote about working too much in his younger days before he finally learned that it was more important to spend valuable time with his family. He talked about this in his eulogy, recounting some of the memories he had with his children, wife, and parents that he wouldn’t have had if he’d been working overtime. It meant less money for exotic vacations, but as he put it, “seeing the Great Wall of China will never compare to watching my five-year-old perform in a kindergarten play.”\n\nA first-person eulogy is the perfect place to say apologies you’ve never been able to say face-to-face and bury the hatchet on any arguments before your death. For estranged relationships or those that ended in conflict, a pre-written eulogy can offer comforting closure. It can turn a sad occasion into a powerful, healing experience. Read More: Let’s Talk About Our Grief Some people use their eulogy as a chance to apologize for their very human shortcomings, assuring their loved ones that they did their best even when they fell short and that they hope the people left behind will be able to remember the good times more often than the painful ones. Most importantly, your eulogy is your occasion to express your caring and appreciation for the people you love. You can let them know how important they have been to you, what you admire about them, and what they’ve done for you that has been enormously valuable in your life. Even if you’ve already said it to them directly, saying it to them one more time after you’re gone will be enormously meaningful to them.\n\nIf you have children, telling them how proud you are will stay with them forever. I recommend being specific about it. Speak to each child about their individual strengths that you admire, and provide encouragement and confidence that they can take with them. It’s your opportunity to tell them how much you believe in them and the life they can create, despite whatever challenges they might have experienced. If your child is struggling, this can be a remarkable boost for them as they grieve.\n\nYou can’t always count on being able to say goodbye to those you love. Even in the case of a prolonged illness, you might be unconscious or too weak to do it. By writing your own first-person eulogy ahead of time, you get to say goodbye to everyone who has had an impact on you—not just family members and close friends, but also coworkers, mentors, and community members you want to remember and convey your feelings about. When you write while you’re still feeling healthy, you’ll be less likely to forget anyone, and you can always add to the list as necessary. Doing this in advance is an incredibly empowering and comforting experience that will allow you to leave nothing unsaid.",

Instead, as the televised briefing began, Zelensky reached for another one of his gifts. It was a folder containing a series of gruesome photographs, showing Ukrainian prisoners of war after their time in Russian captivity. Some of their bodies were grotesquely emaciated. Others showed signs of torture. “That’s tough stuff,” Trump said, his face leaden, as he took the photos from Zelensky and began leafing through them.\n\nThose pictures, according to some U.S. officials, marked the point when the meeting went wrong. Had Zelensky offered the championship belt, the gesture might have lightened the mood. The photos had the opposite effect. They seemed to get Trump’s guard up, as though he were being blamed for the suffering of those soldiers. Still, even today, Zelensky does not regret his decision to present these images. He had been trying to reach beyond Trump’s transactional instincts, beyond his need for flattery, and appeal to Trump as a human being. “He has family, loved ones, children. He has to feel the things that every person feels,” Zelensky says. “What I wanted to show were my values. But then, well, the conversation went in another direction.”",

        "title": "Is Trump On a Collision Course with Energy Companies?",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "When oil and gas executives first began using the phrase “all of the above” more than a decade ago, it was their pitch that climate advocates and sympathetic policymakers should keep natural gas alongside renewables in their vision of a new energy future. The grid needs abundant, reliable natural gas as back up when the wind isn’t blowing, they argued. This year, the tables have turned. With renewable energy in the Trump Administration’s crosshairs, energy industry big wigs have come to use “all of the above” as a reminder that renewable energy—particularly solar—has an important role to play in keeping the lights on.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We believe in all forms of energy,” said John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy, the world’s most valuable electricity company, at a CERAWeek side event. “When we go to customers, we don't really care if we're selling wind turbines or gas turbines, we want to give them the lowest cost solution.” To hear some activists talk about the new Trump Administration, the president blindly does the bidding of his fossil fuel benefactors. And, in public, many top executives are keen to praise Trump and show close relations with the White House. But behind the scenes many in the industry are more measured, and even critical. Projections of soaring power demand in the U.S. have led utility executives to turn to whatever power source is available—including wind and solar—even as the Trump Administration tries to diminish renewables. Tariffs have threatened the bottomline. And oil executives have woken up to the reality that Trump’s vision of low oil prices doesn’t align with increased domestic production—or industry profits.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that these tensions remain under wraps. Corporate executives are not inclined to cross Trump, and market forces may be strong enough to keep the energy sector humming along mostly in line with expectations. Nonetheless, understanding the complicated nuance—which in many ways is counterintuitive—is important to grappling with the opportunities to minimize emissions in the coming years. There is no better place to digest energy industry sentiments and trends than the annual CERAWeek conference by S&P Global in Houston. The conference, held last week, draws energy executives and government officials from around the world. This year’s conference, which I attended for part of last week, offered a prime example of the phrase “two things can be true at once.” Industry officials widely praised some of the new administration’s deregulatory moves, but at the same time many expressed deep concerns about the uncertainty that Trump has created.\n\n\"Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,\" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on the CERAWeek main stage. \"We have allocated capital that's out there for decades, and so we really need consistent and durable policy.\" Jack Fusco, CEO of natural gas company Cheniere, praised the administration for pivoting the “regulatory machine” in a direction that’s “fair and transparent.” But he followed his praise with a hint of apprehension, saying he hoped the agenda would “hold up in a rule of law”—an acknowledgement of the litigation and uncertainty that surrounds much of Trump’s policy agenda. Even attacks on the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate change law, have some corners of the industry worried. Oil and gas companies had planned to pursue tax incentives for technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage—and dedicated billions in capital to doing so. “We're looking for the continuation of 45Q,” said Vicki Hollub, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, referring to a tax credit for carbon capture on the conference main stage. “To accelerate the technology at the pace that the U.S. needs it to accelerate, to start having the positive impact on our energy independence, we need 45Q to happen and to stay in place.” (The provision is thought to be one of the credits most likely to survive though everything will be in play during negotiations).\n\nBehind the scenes many executives offered more vocal concern. As stocks plummeted on the conference’s opening day, executives stewed over tariffs that Trump imposed on Canada’s energy sector, which is highly integrated with the U.S. And Trump’s unpredictable approach more broadly drew concern. In the long term, different views on the price of oil may represent the biggest potential collision. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would like to see the price of oil come down as low as $50/barrel. (Right now the U.S. benchmark for crude oil is around $72/barrel). Voters love low energy prices because it means affordable gas at the pump. But oil companies hate when prices sink too low because it’s harder to turn a profit. For utility executives, the complication of rising power demand remains top of mind. Analysts have predicted soaring demand for electricity as technology companies grow their data center footprint in response to artificial intelligence. That has led the industry to pursue whatever electricity it can build quickly—a lot of natural gas, yes, but also a lot of solar.\n\nAs I’ve written before, the dynamic nature of the Trump Administration’s policymaking makes it difficult for companies to plan. And predicting what comes next is folly. But whatever happens it’s safe to say that the convenient narrative of a Trump Administration moving in lockstep with the energy sector is, at the very least, missing several puzzle pieces.\n\nIt also means, oddly, that the most influential advocates in Washington for some decarbonization provisions—like carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, and hydrogen—may be energy executives embracing the “all of the above” mantra. But even that may not be enough to save climate-friendly tax incentives.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here\n\nTIME receives support for climate coverage from the Outrider Foundation.TIME is solely responsible for all content.",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "content": "The budget vote was seen as a key test for Netanyahu’s coalition, which is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties who had demanded and largely received hefty sums for their constituents in exchange for support for the funding package. By law, the government would fall and elections triggered if a budget weren't passed by March 31.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s parliament on Tuesday passed a state budget, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.\n\nWith its passing, Netanyahu buys himself what’s likely to be more than a year of political quiet that could see his government coast through to the end of its term in late 2026, a rare occurrence in Israel’s fractious politics. It’s a political win for Netanyahu, who faces mass protests over his decision to resume the war in Gaza while hostages still remain in Hamas' hands, and over his government’s recent moves to fire top legal and security chiefs.\n\nThe budget vote could also have implications on the war in Gaza. Netanyahu could feel free to move toward a lasting ceasefire with Hamas since his political allies, who oppose ending the war, have little incentive to trigger new elections while their polling numbers are down, said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nBut the vote doesn't mean Netanyahu will move in the direction to end the war, she said. She expected him to further his ultranationalist partners’ agenda to keep them as loyal allies and galvanize the nationalist right ahead of any future vote.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "title": "Why K-Pop's NewJeans—Or NJZ—Is Fighting an Industry Giant",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The year 2024 left K-pop idol Lee Hyein, in a word, confused. In just months, she and her bandmates in NewJeans went from being one of the industry’s biggest-selling acts to a group of renegade artists in a controversial dispute with the label they abruptly left. “Some people would conveniently switch their perspective, treating me as a kid when it suited them and then expecting me to act like an adult when it was more convenient for them,” said Hyein, 16, through an interpreter during a video interview with TIME in early March. “It was really tough—definitely one of the hardest times for me.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLast November, Hyein, along with bandmates Minji (Kim Minji), Danielle (Danielle Marsh), Haerin (Kang Haerin), and Hanni (Phạm Ngọc Hân), unilaterally terminated their contract with former label and management company ADOR—a subsidiary of K-pop juggernaut HYBE, the firm behind BTS. It was a rare revolt that sent jitters across the South Korean entertainment industry, as the group’s members have accused their former label of “unfair treatment,” “discrimination,” and workplace harrassment—all of which ADOR has denied. To everyone’s surprise, in February, the members, who are all under 21, revealed they have taken on a different group name—NJZ—with a performance comeback set for March 23, at the ComplexCon festival in Hong Kong. Haerin says in Korean that nothing about the group has “fundamentally changed,” but in rebranding as NJZ, “we now have greater creative freedom and a broader artistic scope.”\n\nIn an exclusive statement to TIME, the five said they were “disappointed” in the court decision, but added that they didn’t expect the issues in the K-pop industry to change overnight. “Compared to everything we’ve been through so far, this is just another step in our journey,” they said. “Maybe this is just the current reality in Korea. But that’s exactly why we believe change and growth are necessary. It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”\n\nK-pop has, for many years, faced accusations of agencies failing to treat their employees and artists with sensitivity. The industry is further plagued by the high incidence of idol suicides and grueling work conditions required for success. Some idols have broken free from their labels for a greater share of independence and a little more breathing room. “There's just a very structural problem in K-pop in general, where companies don't really view their artists as actual human beings and rather see them as products,” Hanni said. NJZ’s accusations of mistreatment in particular have been raised multiple times. The group’s legal representatives pointed to some instances in an email to TIME. These include claims that a HYBE PR representative called a local reporter to “downplay” the group’s achievements, that a manager allegedly ordered members of another band to ignore Hanni as the latter greeted them (in line with accusations from the group that HYBE higher-ups including Chairman Bang Si-hyuk ignored them), and HYBE’s “media manipulation” just days before their April 2024 comeback. During the group’s interview with TIME, Minji also pointed to how HYBE tried to stop them from wearing memorial ribbons to honor victims of the December 2024 Jeju Air crash.\n\nIn October, Hanni faced South Korea’s lawmakers at the National Assembly to testify on the workplace harassment she said she felt at HYBE. ADOR’s replacement CEO, Kim Joo-young, was also present—she said, “I wonder if there was more I could have done.” Fans of NewJeans have also filed a petition claiming workplace harassment on Hanni’s behalf, though the South Korean labor ministry eventually rejected it, issuing the controversial reason that under the law, artists aren’t legally classified as workers. Feeling backed into a corner, the quintet set a press conference for Nov. 28. “We did not predict any of this was going to happen,” Hanni says. Minji, who had strong words for Chairperson Bang in their November press conference, told TIME in Korean: “Since our debut, we have faced so many obstacles and interference from them. And only now are we finally able to speak about it.”\n\nIn the middle of our conversation, Danielle breaks into tears. “There are probably so many situations similar to ours,” she says. “It's truly heartbreaking to think that anyone would have to go through a situation like this.”\n\nA separate hearing on the validity of the five’s contract with ADOR, which is set to expire in 2029, is scheduled for April 3, and the process may take years. Some in the industry sounded alarms that a potential legal victory for NJZ could harm the industry by rattling future investments into idols since they could set a precedent for unilaterally canceling contracts. These industry leaders say that agencies are getting the short end of the stick, given their investments in their talents. ADOR invested some 21 billion Korean won (around $14 million) for the group to debut, and argued in court that over 12 billion won (around $8 million) has been paid out to NewJeans members in settlement, since October 2023. ADOR, in a statement to TIME, said that their aim is “not to hinder the artists' careers, but to ensure that they can continue their activities under our existing contractual agreement.”\n\nBut damage to agencies is not what NJZ’s legal representatives are seeking with a favorable ruling—only for the five to “break free” from “unfair constraints” they say their previous label has set and to be able to pursue their music independently. “It will not have any negative impact [on] other entertainment companies or artists,” they said in their email to TIME. “If a company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and properly protected its artists, there would be no grounds for the artist to win a lawsuit against them.” Minji, in particular, tells TIME that their demands from HYBE and ADOR weren’t ​​”anything extraordinary or unreasonable.” Legal experts have expressed varying opinions as to what the outcome could be. Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo cites one lawyer who believes HYBE’s reported plan to abandon NewJeans makes for a “strong case” on the group’s behalf to unilaterally end its contract, while another says there may not be sufficient grounds for such a termination. NJZ could lose a lot of money if it loses in court: experts say the penalty for breaching their contract with ADOR could go up to 620 billion won (around $420 million).\n\nADOR, in its statements to TIME, said that it “regret[s] the escalation of this matter to court,” and said that any “misunderstandings,” which it blamed on the label’s previous management, “can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members’ return to the label.” But the relationship between NJZ and ADOR may be beyond repair, given how the group is taking on business matters on its own. Hanni disputed rumors that they have signed with a new label, but says, “We are looking for an agency to help us… a third party to help us in between to communicate with other people.” They’re also putting all their efforts into what their comeback will look like. As NewJeans, the five members became known for exuding a Y2K vibe in their music and fashion, but as NJZ, they’re saying they have more room to experiment. They held off on saying how exactly they would change things up, with Danielle saying fans will have to find out by watching their Hong Kong performance live: “We want it to be like, BAM!, like, just in that moment.”\n\nLegal issues aside, the five got excited and jittery while speaking about what’s to come for their craft, as they fight for their independence and creative freedom. They also expressed gratitude to the fans—whom they still call “Bunnies”—and to their families, who have backed them throughout the feud. “At first, when this situation happened, my initial thought was, ‘Why does this have to happen to me?’\" Minji says of their ordeal. “But now, I realize that I’ve grown through this experience and have met so many incredible people along the way.” Back in 2023, Hanni told TIME that it would be hard to predict the future of K-pop. Less than two years later, she says she didn’t expect to be at the heart of K-pop’s latest workplace-related controversy. “We don't know what's going to happen in the future,” her bandmate Danielle echoes, adding that it was not the group’s intention to be embroiled in such a mess, but she regarded their ordeal as an “important experience” for themselves as artists.\n\nAnd while the outcome could have far-reaching consequences, Hanni and the girls are choosing not to worry about what those might be right now. “If it changes the K-pop industry, it does. If it doesn't, it just won't, and that's what it will be,” she says. “Whether it changes the K-pop industry or not, I think we are really proud of ourselves.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If there’s one thing you can say about Americans at this point in time, it’s that we’re stressed—and we’re constantly told by health experts to reduce or manage our stress because it’s killing us. But what if I told you that stress can actually be good for you—and that, sometimes, more stress is actually helpful. As a doctor and researcher in stress and healthy aging, I know that sounds nonsensical or, at best, counterintuitive, but that’s exactly what the fascinating new science of hormesis, or “good stress,” shows. Certain kinds of stress are not only beneficial; they are essential. They build resilience, support brain and metabolic health, and even promote longevity. This new approach to stress is one of the most exciting and upcoming areas of longevity and wellness research.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile it is unquestionable that chronic stress from situations like caregiving, unmanageable workloads, chronic illness, difficult relationships, and financial hardship can harm your health, so-called hormetic stressors are different. They are intermittent, acute bursts of stress, such as periods of fasting, vigorous exercise, or learning a new skill. From the Greek “to excite,” hormetic stressors activate your body’s innate ability to grow stronger and more mentally and physically resilient. Leveraging good stress—and learning the difference between “stress” and being “stressed out”—may be the most transformative and accessible self-help tool we have today. And perhaps also the most fun. The science of good stress So, what exactly is stress? Stress is any challenge that disrupts our body’s natural balance, or homeostasis. An intriguing discovery in stress biology is that recovery from stress doesn’t simply restore us to our previous state. In the process of re-establishing balance, we either net harm—which is the case with chronic stress—or we overcompensate and gain resilience, which underlies the health-enhancing benefits of hormetic stress. All stress leaves long-lasting effects that shape-shift our biology. But while chronic stress leaves us less resilient, good stress makes us stronger.\n\nStress ripples down to the level of our cells. Hormetic stressors—such as eating plant-based phytochemicals, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), cold and heat exposure, intermittent fasting that optimizes circadian rhythms, and intentional mental and emotional challenges—activate a highly conserved set of genes crucial for our survival called vitagenes (short for vitality genes). These genes carry the code that heals, repairs, and regenerates our body. They ramp up our antioxidant capacity, regulate inflammation, repair damaged DNA and proteins, recycle old and dysfunctional cells, and increase the energy-making mitochondria that make up our life force. You may be wondering why all this matters. The most common symptoms I encounter in my medical practice, including fatigue, brain fog, digestive issues, mood imbalances, and pain, are manifestations of cellular damage. They stem from damaged DNA, impaired mitochondria, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and improperly folded or clumped proteins. Over time, cellular damage leads to chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, dementia, depression, and cancer. Even the alarming decline in life expectancy can be traced to how our modern environments and lifestyles are harming our cells.\n\nGood stress, on the other hand, is the gateway to making our cells more stress-resilient and efficient. Since cells are our body’s most fundamental building block, self-engineering healthier cells is a systems biology way of reaching our fullest potential for health, longevity, and limitless possibility. Read More: Why Zero Stress Shouldn’t Be Your Goal A good stress prescription While most of our current stress management advice is about drawing boundaries, hormesis is about pushing beyond them. Stepping outside your comfort zone might sound daunting, but challenging yourself doesn’t need to be extreme to be effective. In fact, it shouldn’t be. Eating more plants is a simple (and delicious) example. When plants face stress in their environment, they produce phytochemicals that, when we in turn consume them, activate our good stress defenses. For example, resveratrol in grapes, pistachios, and dark chocolate turns on sirtuins, master regulators of new mitochondria creation. Sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts, cabbage, and kale activates phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidants that rapidly break down toxins and fight oxidative stress. A rule of thumb: the more vibrant the color and flavor of the plant, the richer it is in stress-enhancing phytochemicals.\n\nExtending an overnight fast beyond twelve hours is another hormetic habit. Perceived stress from nutrient deprivation turns off mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), a cellular switch that initiates autophagy, our body’s method of cleaning up damaged cells and recycling their components. Incorporating a HIIT workout, which alternates between intense bursts of near all-out effort and rest, is particularly beneficial. It rapidly depletes energy stores, sending a strong stress signal that powers up the production of energy-producing mitochondria, effectively upgrading our cellular engines. Then there’s cold and heat exposure. Yes, cold plunges are trendy (and pricey), but you don’t need high-end equipment to get the benefits. A 30-second blast of cold at the end of your shower or even turning the thermostat down to 60°F taps into the same ancient stress-response pathways that increase motivation, mood, and metabolism.\n\nHeat exposure may be a more relaxing and enjoyable alternative. Saunas or hot baths trigger heat shock proteins (HSPs), which help repair damaged proteins, reduce inflammation, and enhance cellular resilience. Just 20 minutes in a sauna mimics the effects of exercise, raising heart rate and activating stress-response pathways that improve cardiovascular health, brain function, and longevity. Even cognitive and emotional challenges—in a Goldilocks “just right” hormetic amount—stimulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that builds new connections between brain cells and strengthens existing ones through neuroplasticity. Upgrading our brain's hardware makes it more resilient and capable of greater creativity, big-picture thinking, and mood regulation. And here’s the coolest part: phytochemicals, fasting, HIIT, and sauna also raise BDNF, meaning that training your body to handle stress makes your brain more adaptable, too. This phenomenon of cross-adaptation—where stress from any hormetic stressor builds resilience against others—is the quintessential mind-body medicine. We can challenge our bodies to strengthen our emotional resilience, and vice versa.\n\nRead More: Why Intentional Discomfort Is Actually Good For You\n\nTrading comfort for strategic stress\n\nDeliberately adding good stress is not biohacking—it’s recognizing that good stress is essential for our physiology. For certain, our Paleolithic genes aren’t well-suited to cope with processed food, sedentary lifestyles, and chronic stress. Yet, they also aren’t designed to deal with a lack of hormetic stress—which has become a stealthy risk factor widely overlooked in our modern world of comfort.

        "content": "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti liked automobiles, particularly his four-cylinder Fiat sports car. For him, the car represented innovation and vitality, even violence. Most of all, it signified the future. An Italian poet, performer, and pamphleteer, Marinetti was a reactionary; he loathed egalitarianism and democracy. He also wasn’t a conservative in any traditional sense, for there was little that he, and others in the Futurist art movement that he founded, wished to conserve. In his 1909 treatise, Founding and Manifesto of Futurism, he wrote, “We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.” A precursor to the fascism that would envelop Europe, Marinetti was an influence on Benito Mussolini, and that ideology, which would soon fulfill that dark promise of destroying Europe’s museums, libraries, and academies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMarinetti’s stronghold over Mussolini has striking parallels to America today—particularly with the rise of the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and its most vocal steward: software engineer and blogger Curtis Yarvin. Largely ignored by academic philosophers, the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and Yarvin have curried favor and influence with tech executives in recent years. A software engineer by training, Yarvin has become a kind of official philosopher for tech leaders like PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Mosaic founder Marc Andreessen. Not unlike the Futurists, Yarvin advocates for replacing democracy with a kind of techno-feudal state—for the government to be run like a corporation, with the president as its “CEO.” This new system is elitist—“humans fit into dominance-submission structures” Yarvin wrote in 2008; and it’s authoritarian—“If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia,” he said in 2012. There are shades of Yarvin’s philosophy in Thiel’s 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, where he wrote “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” And Thiel, through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in the blogger’s startup company Urbit. As for Yarvin’s controversial opinions and whether or not Thiel holds them, Yarvin has said that his patron is “fully enlightened,” as he had been “coaching Thiel.” What’s more, in a recent interview with the Hoover Institution, Andreessen quoted Yarvin and called him a “friend.”\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is that Yarvin’s outsize influence on tech executives has now made its way to Washington. The signs are everywhere: Yarvin was a feted guest at Trump’s so-called “Coronation Ball” in January 2025. Vice President J.D. Vance, a protegee of Thiel’s, spoke admiringly of the blogger’s influence on his thinking when interviewed on a podcast in July 2024. And while Andreessen’s role in the Trump White House is unofficial, The Washington Post reported in January 2025 that the executive “has been quietly and successfully recruiting candidates for positions across Trump’s Washington.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, though not outwardly tipping his hat to Yarvin, seemingly has a similar philosophy: In 2020, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that the “government is simply the largest corporation.” Five years later, Musk has been using his position as an unofficial advisor to the second Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to operationalize what Yarvin has called “a hard reboot” of the government.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington As such, it behooves us to be more familiar with Yarvin and other associated figureheads of this far-right philosophy. Understanding their motivations is essential to understanding what the stakes currently are—and how history can repeat itself. Much can be gleaned about the attractions of this ideology to many of those in power from simply parsing the name of the movement. “Dark Enlightenment” portends the upending of the liberal order that has defined democratic aspirations for nearly three centuries. Where the Enlightenment promised liberty, emancipation, equality, and solidarity, “Dark Enlightenment” offers servitude, hierarchy, bondage, and ruthlessness. The movement is most often associated with the British philosopher Nick Land. Land was a founder of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom until 1995 when his own increasingly erratic behavior had him expelled. Land is actively anti-democratic, desiring a system where great men (guided by algorithms and artificial intelligence) steer the ship of state. This is an explicitly nihilistic vision—“Nothing human makes it out of the near-future,” wrote Land in 1994—an ideology combining technological utopianism with deep misanthropy, a variant of what the historian Jeffrey Herf described as “reactionary modernism,” but which we might as well call cybernetic authoritarianism or technological fascism.\n\nThis leads us to Yarvin. A polemical blogger, Yarvin wrote for years under the goofy name “Mencius Moldbug” where he advocated for his own form of techno-authoritarianism in opposition to democracy. Like Marinetti, Yarvin expressed disdain for those symbols of American culture that he sees as oppositional to “Dark Enlightenment”—from free voting to free inquiry, a vibrant media to the open university. Yarvin, writing in 2021, posited (with significantly less poetry than the Futurists), “Because the university is the heart of the old regime, it is absolutely essential to the success of any regime change that all accredited universities be both physically and economically liquidated.” Yarvin speaks disparagingly of something that he calls “The Cathedral,” a nexus of educational, media, and nonprofit organizations that he believes sets the tenor for discourse, but that also impedes the liberty of executives to do what they will. Rather his aspiration is, as he wrote in 2007, that “the state is simply a real estate business on a very large scale.”\n\nUsing a variety of mixed metaphors, Yarvin advocates for a “Butterfly Revolution,” a “full power start” to the U.S. government accomplished by “giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization.\" This is imagined as an internal coup meant to privatize the government and replace democracy with complete executive authority. Two years ago, Yarvin laid out his strategic program with the acronym “RAGE,” or “Retire all government employees.” Yarvin argued that a hypothetical future Trump administration should terminate all nonpolitical federal workers to have them be replaced by loyalists. The government’s coffers must then be impounded and redirected, according to the blogger. When courts prevent unconstitutional orders, Yarvin says that they should just be ignored. After that, the free press and universities must be curtailed, as well—Yarvin said no later than April after the inauguration.\n\nThat so much of this seems to mirror the actions of the Trump administration and DOGE may not be a coincidence. So far, some 30,000 federal employees—across departments as varied as the FDA, the National Park Service, and the FAA—have been fired by DOGE in the name of government efficiency. Yarvin’s musings in 2009 that the “definition of a sovereign is that a sovereign is above the law,” hold a mirror to Trump’s February tweet that “He who save his country, violates no law.”\n\nYarvin’s claim that “No brand or building can survive” is perfectly congruent with the tech industry’s notorious ethos to “Move fast and break things.” But what’s also being seemingly witnessed is a harbinger of the “monarchism” that Yarvin desires. On February 19, Trump posted a doctored image of himself in a crown with the caption “Long Live the King!” on his social media app Truth Social.\n\nAs is so often the case with Trump, pundits have a tendency to assume a lack of seriousness or intention with what the president says. The same dismissiveness sometimes accompanied the Futurists, and Mussolini’s fascists for that matter, when they were ascendant. Now, as Trump threatens longtime American allies from Panama to Mexico, Canada to Denmark, a belief of the Futurists even more disturbing than their worship of technology should be remembered: Marinetti’s claim that “War is the hygiene of the world.”",

        "title": "Developing Countries Chart New Climate Path as Trump Returns",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley has become a leading champion of small economies in global climate discussions. And so I took note at last year’s United Nations climate conference when she said she thought countries should engage then-President elect Trump to try to explain the importance of climate work. “I am not one of those who will come out and say immediately that with the election of President Trump all is gloom and doom,” she said at a fireside chat last November. “We need to find mechanisms… to have the conversations.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMottley’s position has evolved since then. Trump entered office in January with an aggressive agenda to attack clean energy and end collaboration on climate change. Last week, as delegates from around the world gathered in Barbados for a sustainable energy conference, Mottley instead insisted that small countries would need to find their own way forward. “You don't spend time or energy praying over what could have been,” she said. “But we deal with the world as it is.” Across three days of talks at the SEforAll Global Forum in Barbados, Trump barely came up explicitly. It’s not that anyone there underestimated the consequences of his election for global climate progress. Rather, his election has finally sunk in, and attention has turned to paving a path forward—without the U.S. It’s a telling glimpse at how climate discussions may be shifting. The gravitational pull of the U.S. should not be dismissed; some countries will inevitably follow his lead. Nonetheless, if the conversations in Barbados provide any indication, many emerging and developing economies remain eager to forge their own clean energy path.\n\nThe U.S. shadow has always loomed large over international climate collaboration. As the world’s largest economy and only superpower, climate negotiators had to adjust language carefully to respond to the U.S. political context. With the Paris Agreement in place, conversations have largely focused on finance—getting money flowing to energy transition projects, particularly in developing and emerging economies. But despite the central role the U.S. played in setting up the system, U.S. public money never came to represent the lifeblood of international climate finance—even as developing countries and climate advocates insisted that the country owed it to the rest of the world to pay up because of its historical emissions. Even in the climate-friendly Biden Administration, it took significant wrangling for the White House to commit to $11 billion in annual international climate finance. To put that in perspective, developing countries left last year’s U.N. climate talks disappointed that their wealthier counterparts committed only to a total $300 billion in annual climate finance.\n\nIn other words, on the finance front, the U.S. isn’t leaving that big of a gap to fill. So where will the money come from? One key area under discussion at the SEforAll forum, where I spoke with officials in the public and private sectors based everywhere from Fiji to Sierra Leone, was so-called south-south collaboration. Instead of looking to the U.S. and Europe to pony up capital, developing and emerging market countries can work together—providing the goods and finance without the help of their wealthier counterparts. According to research from the Brookings Institution, trade between Global South countries recently surpassed trade between Global North countries. “This is a great signal of progress,” Arancha González, a former foreign minister of Spain who is now the dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po, told me on a panel I moderated at the forum. “It tells us that there is a new world out there.”\n\nPotential sources of finance include development banks located in large emerging economies like Brazil and South Africa. Institutions like the New Development Bank, formed in 2014 by the BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have financed billions in clean energy development. And, of course, it’s impossible to talk about this financial picture without talking about China. The country’s Belt and Road Initiative has been a source of more than $1 trillion in capital for infrastructure since its inception in 2013. In recent years, the country has increasingly focused its funding on green projects. Many developing countries have also focused on raising capital locally to fund projects—pushing savings and pension fund money to invest in the local market rather than looking abroad for higher returns. And then there are the new methods of what is often called blended finance. Traditionally, the term refers to a combination of public and private capital where the public money lowers the risk for private investors. More recently, philanthropy has entered the blended finance conversation, playing an increasingly important role providing money\n\n“We have what we call strange bedfellows, where… institutional investors are partnering with a philanthropic organization, and together coming up with a blended finance solution that is innovative in approach,” says Ije Ikoku Okeke, who runs catalytic climate capital for the Global South at RMI, a clean energy non-profit. A right-wing populist might not object to this new dynamic. In such a world view, American money should support Americans—leaving other countries to their own devices. But is the U.S. really better off if the rest of the world builds a coalition with Americans on the sidelines? Putting U.S. strategic interests aside, it is a little refreshing to hear a conversation about clean energy in the Global South that doesn’t get bogged down in whether the U.S. is going to live up to its moral responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter and instead focuses on solutions.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.\n\nTIME receives support for climate coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "content": "'It didn't express the real horror': The true story of The Great Escape\n\n1 day ago Share Save Aine Quinn Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOn 24 March 1944, 76 allied officers broke out of a German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag Luft III – a mission that was memorialised in a classic film, The Great Escape. In 1977, a key member of the escape team, Ley Kenyon, was interviewed on the BBC's Nationwide.\n\nOn a snowy moonless night in 1944, more than 200 allied officers attempted to break out of a German prisoner-of-war camp. It was the culmination of an incredibly ambitious plan that entailed more than a year of bribes, tunnelling, and the assembly-line production of equipment, uniforms and documents, all of which had to be painstakingly hidden from the camp's guards and spies.\n\nThe Great Escape, John Sturges's 1963 film about the breakout, is a much-loved classic starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough and James Garner. But it contains many inaccuracies. Jem Duducu, historian and presenter of the Condensed History podcast, described it in an interview in Metro as \"a strange mixture of fastidious creation and pure Hollywood fantasy\".\n\nWATCH: 'That tunnel was flooded, but the drawings survived'.\n\nThe story was first told by Paul Brickhill, one of the people who helped with the escape attempt, in his 1950 book, The Great Escape. He describes Ley Kenyon, who illustrated the book, as the mission's \"star counterfeiter\". Discussing the film with Dilys Morgan on the BBC's Nationwide in 1977, Kenyon said: \"It was good entertainment, but it certainly didn't express the real horror of being a prisoner of war, the horror being, of course, in one's personal feelings about being behind barbed wire – the boredom, the hunger. The hunger was pretty grim.\"\n\nOther ex-prisoners had a different view of the film. Charles Clarke, who was in the camp at the time, and had aided the plot as a look-out, told the BBC in a 2019 radio interview: \"Even after all these years, I've always thought what a remarkable film it was.\"\n\nOne major change that the film made was to the personnel involved. While the events of The Great Escape are mostly rooted in fact, names were changed, and various people were combined into composite characters. At the time of the escape, no Americans remained in the compound, and the man who was said to be the model for McQueen's Virgil Hilts, William Ash, did not take part. The plan was spearheaded by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell – who in the film was renamed Bartlett, and played by Attenborough. First captured in 1940 after being shot down, Bushell had an impressive record of escape attempts, once getting within 100 yards of neutral Switzerland.\n\nStalag Luft III was the Germans' attempt at an escape-proof camp, specifically for air force officers from the UK, Canada, Australia, Poland and other allied countries. It was built and run by the Luftwaffe as a secure place to hold people they believed were escape risks. What they had not done, however, was consider the ramifications of trapping so many escape experts in one place.\n\nMonths of preparation\n\nThe camp was built over sandy soil that was difficult to tunnel through. This subsoil was also lighter and more yellow than the dark topsoil, making it obvious if any appeared on the ground of the camp. Huts were perched on brick legs to make tunnels down from them obvious. Brickhill describes in his book a \"double barbed wire fence nine-feet (2.75m) high\", just outside of which were 15-ft (4.5m) high \"goon-boxes\" every 100 yards or so, manned by sentries with searchlights and machine-guns. Additionally, microphones were buried in the ground around the wire so that they could pick up the sounds of any tunnelling.\n\nAs you might expect from a plan hatched by soldiers, the tunnel-digging enterprise was run with military efficiency. Bushell – also known as \"Big X\" – was in charge, and delegated certain parts of the organisation to other men. The planning began even before Stalag Luft III was built: Bushell and others knew it was coming, and volunteered to help build it. As a result, they were able to map it out and pick the best spots for a tunnel. Bushell had the idea that they would dig not one tunnel but three simultaneously. The logic was that if the Germans found one of them, they would never suspect that there were two others. They were to be referred to only by their codenames of Tom, Dick and Harry. Bushell threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word \"tunnel\".\n\nAlamy In The Great Escape, Donald Pleasence's character (pictured centre) is a counterfeiting expert, loosely based on Ley Kenyon (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe aim was for 200 men to escape. This was a colossal undertaking. Each man needed a set of civilian clothes, forged passes, a compass, food, and more. Some passes needed photographs, so a camera was smuggled in by a guard who had been bribed. In the film, Donald Pleasence's character is in charge of the forgery. In reality, Kenyon was one of the forgers who had to counterfeit the thousands of pieces of paperwork necessary. In the Nationwide interview, he recalled how they made it happen: \"We made a printing press, for one thing, and each letter had to be hand-carved out of rubber which we got from the cobbler – rubber heels – or bits of wood cut with razor blades.\" Every document had to be perfect. They replicated passes and paperwork that they had either stolen from the guards or persuaded the guards to show them. \"Something like 7 or 8,000 pieces of paper were produced,\" he said.\n\nThe tunnels themselves were also miracles of engineering and ingenuity. An air pump was made with kit-bags and wood, and air was pumped through a line made of empty milk tins that had been sent by the Red Cross. A major issue was the dispersal of the soil that had been dug up, so bags that hung inside trousers were fashioned from long underwear and used to drop the sand around the camp, where it could be kicked into the ground.\n\nIn History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\nOf the three tunnels, Tom was discovered by the guards only a short while before it would have been completed. After a break, the decision was made to continue only with Harry. This tunnel was finished in the winter of 1943, and sealed up until conditions were suitable for a breakout. That time finally came on the night of 24 March 1944. Many things went wrong, but ultimately, of the 220 people chosen, 76 made it out before the 77th was spotted by a guard.\n\nA massive operation was mobilised to recapture the 76. They all knew that it was likely that they would be caught, but many viewed it as their duty to attempt escape. Another goal of the men was to make the Germans pull resources from their war effort to guard and search for them. According to Brickhill, five million Germans were involved in the search for the escaped prisoners. All but three of the 76 were recaptured. Two managed to make it to Sweden, and one to Spain.\n\nHitler wanted all 73 of the recaptured prisoners to be shot. Those around him managed to talk him out of it – after all, the British held German prisoners of war, and would not take kindly to the massacre of their officers. Still, Hitler declared that 50 of them should die. Ken Rees, who was in the tunnel when it was discovered, recounted hearing that those murdered were \"taken out in twos and threes, and shot\", in a BBC Witness History podcast in 2010.\n\nBrought to justice\n\nIn the fictionalised version, all of the men are driven to a field and shot by a machine-gun, but the reality involved more deceitful measures. Brickhill's book notes that the men were taken in small groups in the direction of the original camp and shot on the way. He wrote, \"The shootings will be explained by the fact that the recaptured officers were shot while trying to escape, or because they offered resistance, so that nothing can be proved later.\" All of the bodies were cremated, and, as Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden pointed out in a parliamentary speech given in June 1944, the only reason for this would have been to hide the manner of death.\n\nBushell was one of the men caught and murdered. He died aged 33. Details of his death came out in the investigation afterwards: along with his escape partner, he was shot in the back by Gestapo officers. His ashes were returned to the camp with the rest of the dead, but, according to his niece, the casket was broken when armies advanced on the camp, and so, more than 80 years later, he remains there.\n\nTwo of the men who managed to avoid execution were Jimmy James and Sydney Dowse. In a 2012 documentary, Dowse gave his perspective as a survivor. \"You rather wonder why the hell you yourself weren't shot. That's what Jimmy and I felt, anyway. Why we weren't shot. We could have been. It was just luck. And… pretty terrible.\"\n\nThe execution of 50 prisoners of war caused outrage in the UK. Eden said in his speech to Parliament: \"His Majesty's Government must, therefore, record their solemn protest against these cold-blooded acts of butchery. They will never cease in their efforts to collect the evidence to identify all those responsible. They are firmly resolved that these foul criminals shall be tracked down to the last man wherever they may take refuge. When the war is over they will be brought to exemplary justice.\" After the war, a huge effort was put into investigating the killings. As a result, the details emerged, and 13 Gestapo officers were hanged for their part in the executions.\n\nIt was only six years after the escape, in 1950, that Brickhill published his account of it, which was subsequently adapted into the famous film. When Charles Clarke was asked about his opinion of the Hollywood version of events, he said, \"Without the film, who would remember what a magnificent achievement it was?\"\n\n--\n\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come.\n\nLanding on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.\n\nOur taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. \"No building can be higher than a coconut tree,\" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.\n\nWe soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. \"People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,\" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). \"Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.\"\n\nGetty Images The Cook Islands' population of 21,000 is spread over 15 islands (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own Māori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.\n\n\"For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditional Ra'ui System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,\" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. \"The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.\"\n\nThoughtul Travel Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\n\nThis philosophy persists today – and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.\n\nOn arrival at The Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm \"Kia Orana\", a greeting that translates to \"may you live long\". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.\n\nPamela and Gary Baker The popular Muri Night Market offers a Rent-a-Plate project to reduce disposable plastic (Credit: Pamela and Gary Baker)\n\nAs the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At the Muri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes like ika mata (raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) and rukau rukau (taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market's Rent-a-Plate project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.\n\nHow to play your part 1. Support the Cook Islands economy by buying local crafts, clothing and food. Attend a cultural tour or show and embrace the traditions, customs and lifestyle. 2. Take shorter showers to save the islands' limited water supply and minimise electricity use. 3. Volunteer with Muri Environment Care Group. Every Wednesday and Thursday, visitors can join efforts to protect Muri Lagoon by participating in soil restoration projects and planting native trees near streams to control sediment flow into the lagoon. 4. Choose eco-friendly experiences and products, use reef-safe sunscreen and avoid single-use plastics.\n\nBeyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established the Marae Moana Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.\n\n\"Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,\" said Eggelton.\n\nAlso offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here the Pacific Resort Aitutaki has launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.\n\n\"The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,\" explains Goodwin. \"Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose.\" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. \"The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.\"\n\nGetty Images Cook Island locals are committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.\n\nAt Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, the Te Ara O Te Onu (Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through the Citizen Science Project by taking photos and sending them into the programme.\n\nBy the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. \"It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,\" said Eggelton.\n\nGoodwin echoed the sentiment: This is our little paradise; if we all look after it, she will look after us.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "How long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\n\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\n\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\n\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\n\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\n\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\n\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\n\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\n\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\n\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\n\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\n\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\n\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\n\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\n\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\n\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\n\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\n\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know – it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come – I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\n\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\n\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\n\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\n\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\n\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"",

This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.\n\nThe reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.\n\nPerhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.\n\nSouthgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.\n\nBut, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.\n\nFor Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.\n\nCertain clues from training have also proved red herrings. For example, Morgan Rogers and Anthony Gordon featured heavily in shape training the day before the Albania game, causing many in camp to believe the pair would start the game.\n\nYet both started on the bench - though Rogers was named in the XI against Latvia.\n\nNot that the uncertainty over team selection appears to have hindered the players.\n\nSix points, five goals and two clean sheets represents an encouraging start for Tuchel.",

        "content": "The UN has declared 2025 as the year of glacier preservation. Here's how to visit one safely\n\n4 days ago Share Save Anna Fiorentino Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nWith glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late.\n\nOn an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day.\n\n\"Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,\" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.\n\nThe reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 – and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.\n\n\"Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,\" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nSadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center.\n\nAlamy Italy's Marmolada glacier could disappear by 2040 as temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThese slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nBut travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely – they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming.\n\nWhile 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution.\n\nColumbia Icefield, Alberta, Canada\n\nMountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs.\n\nShaun King Columbia Icefield visitors can walk on the glacier and learn about its geological features (Credit: Shaun King)\n\nIf you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny.\n\n\"The primary danger is crevasses – deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,\" says de Montigny. \"Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments.\"\n\nMendenhall, Alaska\n\nMendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the \"Glacier State\". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.\n\nSince it has been melting excessively in recent years, you'll need to join a helicopter tour to get more than a look out at the glacier; to hike it (or fly over it) try Alaska Shore Excursions. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.)\n\nAlamy Mendenhall is one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle (Credit: Alamy)\n\nNote: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.\n\nMarmolada, Italian Dolomites\n\nIt's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the \"Queen of the Dolomites\", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier \"Ice City\".\n\nCrevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial – Andrea Milani\n\nIf you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. \"Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.\n\n\"Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,\" he adds. \"If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones – don't hang around under them longer than necessary.\"\n\nMer de Glace, France\n\nIt's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier – transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours – has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year.\n\nAlamy The Mer de Glace ice cave has to be dug out each summer since the glacier shifts as much as 70m every year (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSince last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through – originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\n\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Your feet are home to billions of bacteria. How often should you wash them?\n\n1 day ago Share Save Jasmin Fox-Skelly Share Save\n\nGorka Olmo/BBC (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)\n\nSome people scrub them every day while others say letting water run over them in the shower is enough. So are you cleaning these important appendages enough?\n\nWhen you jump into the shower and reach for the soap and loofah, it's fair to say that certain body parts probably receive more attention than others. The underarm region no doubt gets the full lather, rinse, repeat treatment. Your feet, by virtue of being located at the end of your body, can be easy to overlook. However, according to some experts, your feet are just as, if not more, deserving of attention.\n\nBoth the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and US Centre for Disease Control (CDC), for example, advise washing feet daily with soap and water. One reason for this meticulous care is to prevent odour. The soles of the foot contain 600 sweat glands per square centimetre of skin, more than any other region of the body. Although sweat itself doesn't smell, it contains a nutritious broth of salts, glucose, vitamins and amino acids, which serves as an all-you-can-eat buffet for bacteria that live there. And there a lot of bacteria.\n\n\"The foot – especially between the toes – is quite a moist, humid, and warm environment, so it can be a breeding ground for microbes,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull in the UK. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people encase their feet in socks and shoes, trapping the moisture inside.\n\nThis is probably a good reason to clean your feet. In one study, researchers swabbed the soles of 40 volunteers. They found that foot washing had a significant impact on bacteria numbers. People who washed their feet twice a day had around 8,800 bacteria living in each square centimetre of skin. Those who reported washing every other day had over one million bacteria per square centimetre.\n\nHowever just because the soles of your feet are brimming with microbial life, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily smelly or that there is anything to worry about. As always, it's not just the number, but the type of bacteria that's important.\n\nThe human foot contains a greater biodiversity of fungal species than any other body region\n\nStaphylococcus are the key players when it comes to producing the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) responsible for foot odour. Sweat glands on the skin of the feet release a heady mix of electrolytes, amino acids, urea and lactic acid. The Staphylococcus bacteria consider this a veritable feast and, in the process of feeding, convert amino acids into VFAs. The main chemical culprit is isovaleric acid, which has an unpleasant odour which has been described as having a \"distinct cheesy/acidic note\". The comparison is apt, as many cheeses contain a similar mix of volatile chemicals.\n\nIn one 2014 study, researchers swabbed the feet of 16 subjects and found that 98.6% of the bacteria present on the soles of the feet were Staphylococci. The levels of VFAs, including the key foot odour compound isovaleric acid, were also significantly increased on the sole of the foot compared to the bridge (top) of the foot. Overall, the study concluded that the intensity of foot malodour was correlated to the total number of Staphylococcus present – another reason to reach for the soap.\n\nHowever, washing your feet isn't just about preventing cheesy foot odour. Many diseases and foot problems can be prevented through good foot hygiene.\n\n\"Because of the small space between the toes, these areas are particularly at risk for microbial infections,\" says Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \"This can lead to itching, swelling, and a foul smell. As the skin barrier becomes disrupted, this can also increase the risk of microorganisms invading the skin and causing more significant soft tissue infections known as cellulitis,\" he says.\n\nAccording to Zeichner, the most common problem is the development of athlete's foot, which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet. The fungi that cause athlete's foot thrive in warm, dark, and moist environments – hence why this condition most commonly affects the spaces in-between the toes. Keep this area clean and dry and you deprive the fungi of their perfect home. This is a good thing, as athlete's foot can cause a series of unpleasant symptoms such as itchiness, a scaly rash, flaky skin and cracking on the soles of your feet and between your toes.\n\nGorka Olmo/BBC Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)\n\nKeeping your feet clean could also prevent skin infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas bacteria. While these bacteria exist naturally on your skin, if they get into your bloodstream via a cut then it can lead to a serious infection. Even a minor staph infection can lead to boils – bumps of pus that form under the skin around hair follicles or oil glands.\n\n\"The feet are more prone to infections because there's quite a lot of biomass of bacteria there, and also if you do have cracks or injuries to your feet, it tends to heal much more slowly than other areas of the body,\" says Wilkinson. \"In a situation like that, there's a greater chance that if you have an injury, pathogens could get into that wound, populate and overgrow.\"\n\nYou might also like:\n\nWhile skin infections can still occur if you have good foot hygiene, regularly washing your feet reduces the number of bacteria present. So, if you happen to get a cut, there will be less microbes around to get into the bloodstream.\n\nFrequent foot washing is especially important if you suffer from diabetes, a condition that makes people prone to ulcers and skin infections. Research has shown the feet of diabetic patients contains a higher proportion of pathogenic bacteria residing on the skin.\n\n\"They are there waiting for an opportunity to cause an infection. So, it's really important that people with diabetes are keeping on top of their foot hygiene, because they're at more risk of developing infection because of that,\" says Wilkinson.\n\nTo make matters worse, people with diabetes also have an impaired immune response, so if they do get an infection, their body can't fight it off. Diabetes patients are also prone to cuts, wounds, and sores in the feet that don't heal. If these aren't caught early, then toes, feet, or even limbs may need to be amputated.\n\n\"If you have uncontrolled diabetes, you may have damage to the nerves in your feet, so you can't feel your feet properly,\" says Wilkinson. \"Just the act of washing allows you to properly check your feet for any minor abrasions or dryness that might contribute to having an infection.\"\n\nA lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – Holly Wilkinson\n\nFor that reason, Wilkinson – and charities such as Diabetes UK – recommend that diabetes patients wash their feet every day.\n\nBut what about everyone else? Some experts argue that for most people, washing the feet every day has little health benefit, and can even raise the risk of skin problems.\n\nAfter all, the skin relies on its community of helpful microbes to perform essential functions. They repel harmful bacteria, produce lipids that keep the skin hydrated and supple, and even help repair wounds. Intensive washing and scrubbing can remove these beneficial species, especially if the water is hot. As a result, skin can become dry, irritated, or itchy. Cracked skin may allow bacteria to breach the usually impenetrable skin barrier, increasing the likelihood of infections.\n\n\"Overwashing the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, stripping the skin of natural oils, contributing to dryness and inflammation,\" says Zeichner. This leads to itchy, dry skin and can exacerbate conditions like eczema.\n\n\"It is also important not to overly scrub or exfoliate the skin on the feet,\" says Zeichner. \"Calluses develop because of daily trauma. But they actually protect the feet from the environment. Removing calluses takes away that protection.\"\n\nThere is also a concern that antibacterial soaps could upset the delicate balance of microorganisms on the skin, killing the beneficial species and allowing the emergence of hardier, pathogenic strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Finally, our immune system needs to be challenged to a certain extent by microbes in order to do its job. If we don't come into contact with a steady stream of bacteria and viruses in childhood, then our bodies don't learn how to properly respond to attack. Some experts believe that bathing or showering too frequently could actually be counterproductive for you for this very reason.\n\nGorka Olmo/BBC The microbes that live on our feet are actually serve an important purpose, helping to repel harmful bacteria (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)\n\nSo that leaves us with the perennial question, how often should we wash our feet? The answer depends to some extent on the individual.\n\n\"For people with diabetes, it is 100% advised that you wash your feet every day,\" says Wilkinson. \"But if you don't have any underlying conditions, then dermatologists tend to advise that every couple of days is more than enough to maintain good hygiene, without stripping too much of the natural oils on your skin.\"\n\nHowever, Wilkinson points out that if you're somebody likes to run or work out at the gym, then you will obviously need to wash your feet more regularly than somebody who is less active. It's also not just the frequency of washing that's important either. How you wash and dry your feet also has health implications.\n\n\"A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – you need to actually physically wash your feet with soapy water,\" says Wilkinson.\n\nHowever, according to Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol in the UK, the most important thing he stresses to patients is to make sure you dry your feet properly. \"When you've got wetness or dampness in between the toes that's allowed to just remain there in a warm environment, that's when you're prone to developing things like athlete's foot and other fungal infections,\" says Baumgardt.\n\n--\n\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.",

        "content": "The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\n1 day ago Share Save Rebecca Treon Share Save\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy\n\nIt's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\n\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\n\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Jalal Antone came up with a twist on a classic sandwich to encourage people to come to his Middle Eastern import store (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\n\nSome of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants – Megha McSwain\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Antone’s po’ boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone’s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\n\nWhere to try Houston's most iconic sandwich\n\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on. Antone's Famous Po' Boys still has two locations in Houston – one inside The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the Heights neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\n\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including H-E-B, Randall's, Kroger, and Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like Baylor and The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Visitors to Houston can find jars of Antone's chow chow in local supermarkets (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot – a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Om Ali: An 'unforgettable' sweet with a sinister history\n\n14 March 2025 Share Save Soumya Gayatri Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\n\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Lost manuscript of Merlin and King Arthur legend read for the first time after centuries hidden inside another book\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Donna Ferguson Share Save\n\nCambridge University Library (Credit: Cambridge University Library)\n\nAn intriguing sequel to the tale of Merlin has sat unseen within the bindings of an Elizabethan deeds register for nearly 400 years. Researchers have finally been able to reveal it with cutting-edge techniques.\n\nIt is the only surviving fragment of a lost medieval manuscript telling the tale of Merlin and the early heroic years of King Arthur's court.\n\nIn it, the magician becomes a blind harpist who later vanishes into thin air. He will then reappear as a balding child who issues edicts to King Arthur wearing no underwear.\n\nThe shape-shifting Merlin – whose powers apparently stem from being the son of a woman impregnated by the devil – asks to bear Arthur's standard (a flag bearing his coat of arms) on the battlefield. The king agrees – a good decision it turns out – for Merlin is destined to turn up with a handy secret weapon: a magic, fire-breathing dragon.\n\nFor over 400 years, this fragile remnant of a celebrated medieval story lay undisturbed and unnoticed, repurposed as a book cover by Elizabethans to help protect an archival register of property deeds.\n\nNow, the 700-year-old fragment of Suite Vulgate du Merlin – an Old French manuscript so rare there are less than 40 surviving copies in the world – has been discovered by an archivist in Cambridge University Library, folded and stitched into the binding of the 16th-Century register.\n\nUsing groundbreaking new technology, researchers at the library were able to digitally capture the most inaccessible parts of the fragile parchment without unfolding or unstitching it. This preserved the manuscript in situ and avoided irreparable damage – while simultaneously allowing the heavily faded fragment to be virtually unfolded, digitally enhanced and read for the first time in centuries.\n\nPreviously, it was catalogued as the story of Gawain. \"It wasn't properly inventoried,\" says Irene Fabry-Tehranchi, the French specialist at the library. \"No one had even recorded that it was in French.\"\n\nCambridge University Library The ancient text was found stitched into the binding of a manuscript from the 16th Century (Credit: Cambridge University Library)\n\nWhen she and her colleagues realised the fragment told a story about Merlin and his ability to change shape \"we were really excited,\" she says.\n\nThe Suite Vulgate du Merlin was originally written around 1230, a time when Arthurian romances were particularly popular among noblewomen, although the fragment is from a lost copy dated to around 1300. \"We don't know who wrote the text,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"We think it was probably a collaborative exercise.\"\n\nIt is positioned as a sequel to an earlier text, written around 1200, in which Merlin is born a child prodigy gifted with foresight and casts a spell to facilitate the birth of King Arthur, who proves his divine right to rule by pulling the sword from the stone.\n\n\"The Suite Vulgate du Merlin tells us about Arthur's early reign, his relationship with the knights of the round table and his heroic fight with the Saxons. It really shows Arthur in a positive light – he's this young hero who marries Guinevere, invents the Round Table and has a good relationship with Merlin, his advisor,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi.\n\nStylistic evidence in the text indicates the fragment was written by an unknown scribe in a northern French dialect understood by English aristocrats\n\nIt is thanks to the sequel, she says, that the story of the Holy Grail – and Merlin's place in that story – could be retold in a coherent way from beginning to end. \"If the sequel was written to facilitate that, it was successful. That became the main way the story was transmitted.\"\n\nStylistic evidence in the text indicates the fragment was written by an unknown scribe in a northern French dialect understood by English aristocrats. \"These are Celtic and English legends, which had circulated orally across the British Isles. But the language used when they are written down is Old French, because of the Norman Conquest.\"\n\nBy the 16th Century, however, Old French had fallen out of favour in England. \"There was a linguistic shift to English among readers of Arthurian literature,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. This may be why the fragment ended up as the book binding of an archival register: \"The text had lost its appeal, so they wanted to reuse it.\"\n\nCambridge University Library The new technology available has allowed scholars like Błażej Mikuła and Amélie Deblauwe to investigate manuscripts without damaging them (Credit: Cambridge University Library)\n\nThe library wanted to preserve the register, which was created in 1580 to record the property of Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, as evidence of 16th-Century archival binding practices in England.\n\nPreviously, it would have been necessary to cut this binding to access the parts of the folded fragment, and the heavily faded areas of the texts would have remained illegible.\n\nToday, multispectral imaging (MSI), CT scanning and 3D modelling has enabled scholars to not only read the faded and hidden texts of the fragment, but to understand exactly how it was folded and sewn into the register. The Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory team at Cambridge University Library has even been able to analyse the different threads used by the Elizabethan bookbinders and the different decoration pigments used by the medieval illuminator, whose job it was to \"illuminate\" manuscripts with decorative illustrations and rich colours.\n\nDown in the basement of the library, in a small photographic studio dominated by a multispectral camera that cost over £100,000 ($125,000), the lab's chief photographic technician Amélie Deblauwe says: \"The specialist imaging techniques that were employed on the Merlin fragment revealed details that would not be visible to the naked eye.\"\n\nDifferent inks and different papers react differently to different lights – Amélie Deblauwe\n\nThe camera takes 49 images of each page using different combinations of light panels emitting different wavelengths of light into both sides of the paper. Starting with invisible ultraviolet light, it moves right through the visible spectrum – \"all the colours of the rainbow\" – to invisible infrared light, she says. \"All of these are measured in nanometres. So we very accurately know what we are doing to the page with these lights, we are really in control of what we're bombarding it with.\"\n\nUsing a range of light colour bands meant that even the tiniest residue of ink, which had chemically degraded over time, could be made to stand out clearly in images. Technicians made the writing more legible by processing the image data using geospatial and open source software. \"That's because different inks and different papers react differently to different lights,\" Deblauwe says. While some lights are absorbed by the parchment and the ink, others are deflected, illuminating different details.\n\nThe camera can even reveal tiny scratches on the parchment by sending light towards the paper at different angles, creating \"surface shadows\". \"We call it 'raking light',\" says Deblauwe.\n\nAn unexpected discovery came when the images revealed that the parchment was significantly lighter in the middle. \"That was an amazing moment for me,\" says Deblauwe. \"It was a little bit noticeable in the colour image, but it became really apparent in the MSI.\"\n\nCambridge University Library Using a range of light colour bands means researchers could discern long-faded residues of inks (Credit: Cambridge University Library)\n\nAfter she saw these images, she realised the parchment was also shinier in the middle and had a waxier feel to it. This indicates that a leather strap had probably once been tied around the middle of the book to hold it together more firmly and, over time, rubbed some of the parchment's fibres away. \"Sometimes you have a bit of a lightbulb moment, and that gives you a greater understanding of the history of the item,\" says Deblauwe. \"This is next level study of manuscript material.\"\n\nOne of the \"trickiest\" challenges the team faced was how to access the text hidden by folds, says Fabry-Tehranchi. The solution was for conservators to carefully handle the parchment while technicians inserted a \"very narrow\" macro probe lens into the darkest crevices of the hidden areas via any part of the parchment that was still accessible.\n\n\"The lens can get very close to an object,\" says chief photographic technician Błażej Władysław Mikuła. \"We take multiple shots, and we stitch the images together.\"\n\nThe result was hundreds of images of Old French words and letters – all handwritten by a medieval scribe – which needed to be put together like a jigsaw. To add a further layer of complexity, some of the images were taken using mirrors to reflect otherwise inaccessible areas of the text, so the images were curved or needed to be rotated or flipped.\n\nFiguring out where a particular image belonged was a painstaking process, but it was ultimately very satisfying, says Fabry-Tehranchi. Only a few square centimetres of the text remain unseen, due to the placement of the thread, but otherwise the fragment has been forced to give up all its secrets.\n\nUsing a CT scanner, which can distinguish between different materials, the team was even able to digitally remove the thread from the spine of the book in a new process which allowed the stitches and materials used by the Elizabethan bookbinders to be analysed. \"We never knew that we would obtain such a good quality image of the structure of the binding,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"It's amazing.\"\n\nMikuła sometimes wonders what these Elizabethans would have made of all his efforts to analyse the fragment. \"They saw it as a piece of rubbish. It could never have crossed their minds what we would do to it.\" He suspects there may be other such manuscripts out there. \"This library is full of treasure that needs to be discovered.\"\n\n--",

This is work for them, but they're also beside themselves with anticipation. \"I am so excited about watching this film!\" says the boss. It's going to be \"perfect\".\n\nMany critics have responded similarly to the series featuring this scene, Apple TV+'s film industry satire The Studio, which has generated major buzz before it even begins this week. One reviewer has called it \"2025's best new show to date\". Another said it was \"the most entertaining and spot-on depiction of Hollywood since Robert Altman's The Player\", hailing its \"stellar scripts and an ensemble of actors who are having an utter blast\". Yet another praises it as \"a love letter to the art of filmmaking\".\n\nApple TV+ Seth Rogen plays a fraught studio head trying to negotiate relationships with film-makers including Olivia Wilde (Credit: Apple TV+)\n\nThe 10-part comedy stars Seth Rogen as Matt Remick, the beleaguered head of a struggling film studio whose efforts to balance commercial viability with artistic integrity invariably cause problems. The Studio is sharp, funny, stylishly filmed and Rogen is a major draw in his own right, but another reason for the excitement surrounding the show is its extraordinary array of Hollywood A-listers playing themselves. They include, among others, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Adam Scott, Olivia Wilde, Zoë Kravitz, Anthony Mackie, Charlize Theron, Steve Buscemi, Ice Cube, Zac Efron and Dave Franco.\n\nEvan Goldberg, who co-created, co-directed and co-wrote the series with his childhood friend and long-time creative partner Rogen, says in the production notes for the show that, except for two who remain nameless, every actor or director they approached to play themselves was up for it: \"People's only real question was, 'What's my joke?' 'What do I get to do?'.\" The stars taking part do have some excellent jokes and several of these big names are sending themselves up mercilessly. If there was an Emmy for \"best sport\", Kravitz would be a shoo-in for her antics in one episode when she accidentally gets high on drugs.\n\nThe hero's dilemma\n\nRogen's Remick is an executive who has worked at the fictional Continental Studios for 22 years. He's a movie nerd; the sort of cinephile who will bend your ear about the incredible funeral shot in 1960s political epic Soy Cuba or wax lyrical about the \"magical\" properties of real film stock. He relaxes by watching Goodfellas for the millionth time. He yearns to make the next Annie Hall or Rosemary's Baby. He loves being around actors and directors and is desperate for their approval but as a studio guy – a suit, a bean-counter – the creatives only ever want to keep him at arm's length. Instead of hanging out with Hollywood's coolest, he has to take meetings with the Rubik's Cube people and the Jenga people because Continental is focused on making trashy popcorn movies with \"known brands\".\n\nThere are enough easter eggs and in-jokes to delight the most knowledgeable of film fans\n\nWhen the Continental head is fired after a string of box office bombs, the unpredictable CEO, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston), selects Matt to replace her. Mill has secured the movie rights to Kool-Aid, the soft-drink mix. He reasons that if a Barbie film can make a billion dollars for Warner Bros, Matt should be able to make money from a movie about the Kool Aid man, the drink's animated marketing mascot. Matt sets to work in the belief that prestige films and box office hits are not mutually exclusive but in a world where TikTok trends dictate film-making decisions, he's quickly forced to question that ideal.\n\nHe has a major problem in that he can't square his admiration for cinema legends with the need to make hard-nosed business decisions. He can't bring himself to tell Ron Howard that the last act of his latest movie sucks. He can't break it to Martin Scorsese that the studio won't be making his script about cult leader Jim Jones.\n\nApple TV+ Kathryn Hahn and Chase Sui Wonders play members of Rogen's team – all 'lovable dolts' (Credit: Apple TV+)\n\nThe Studio is actually exactly the sort of show that a movie nut like Matt would love watching. There are enough easter eggs and in-jokes to delight the most knowledgeable of film fans. For example, the episode about Olivia Wilde making a neo-noir detective film which one character says \"sounds like a rip-off of Chinatown\" features several references to the Roman Polanski classic. The instalment that revolves around director Sarah Polley's attempt to capture an elaborate \"oner\" – a long, single shot – is itself cleverly shot to look like one long take; indeed, much of the series is shot in long takes, giving it a fly-on-the-wall feel. Griffin Mill is also the name of the main character in another Hollywood satire, Robert Altman's aforementioned 1992 film The Player.\n\nThe inspiration for the show\n\nIt was while rewatching beloved TV series during lockdown that Rogen had the idea for a series similar in tone and style to the hit 90s sitcom The Larry Sanders Show, which was set behind the scenes of a late-night talk show, but about the film industry rather than television. Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the writing team (Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory and Frida Perez) drew on their own experiences in the business as fuel for the storylines. According to the production notes, key to Matt's character was Rogen and Goldberg's memory of a studio executive telling them: \"I got into this business because I love movies, and now my job is to ruin them\" – a line that has made it into the show almost unchanged.\n\nAnother classic show Rogen rewatched during lockdown was The Sopranos. Matt Remick does not have a huge amount in common with mob boss Tony Soprano but they do share one thing – a fear that they've arrived at the party too late. In the opening episode of The Sopranos, Tony, who has been suffering from panic attacks, tells his therapist of his \"work\": \"Lately, I've been feeling that I came in at the end. That the best is over.\" Similarly Matt worries that the golden age of cinema has passed. In episode one, he tells the boss he's replaced, Patty (Catherine O'Hara): \"I'm anxious, I'm stressed out, panicking pretty much all the time.\" The Continental office was built as a temple to cinema but, says Matt, \"it feels much more like tomb\". Matt's film-loving assistant Quinn (Chase Sui Wonders) thinks she's \"30 years too late\" to the industry.\n\nThe decline of cinema in the form of the old-school film studios, as the streaming services become ever more successful, is an underlying theme throughout the series. There's a danger that Continental is going to be bought by Amazon. Ted Sarandos, the co-head of Netflix, has a cameo, stealing the limelight at an awards ceremony. An exasperated Scorsese wants Matt to give him back his script so he can go sell it to Apple \"the way I should have done in the first place\".\n\nOf course, the demise of Hollywood has been predicted almost since the first studio opened its doors. Legendary screenwriter Ben Hecht recalled walking around Hollywood in 1951 with David Selznick, the movie mogul who made Gone with the Wind, as Selznick insisted that movies were over and done with. \"Hollywood's like Egypt,\" he told Hecht. \"Full of crumbled pyramids. It'll never come back.\" And yet three quarters of a century later, it's still there. Several of The Studio's exterior scenes pointedly frame the iconic Hollywood sign in the background of the shot.\n\nApple TV+ Martin Scorsese appears, trying to get a script about cult leader Jim Jones off the ground (Credit: Apple TV+)\n\nHecht had been lured to Hollywood from New York by his friend Herman Mankiewicz, the screenwriter of Citizen Kane, who telegraphed him to say: \"Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots.\"\n\nThe Studio leans into the notion that idiots are over-represented in Tinseltown. Matt's team – Quinn, studio exec Sal Saperstein (Ike Barinholtz), and marketing maven Maya Mason (Kathryn Hahn) – are all lovable dolts. Griffin Mill is a lunatic of the first order.\n\nBut Hollywood has always been happy to poke fun at itself. Barton Fink (1991), The Player and Get Shorty (1995) are among the hits that have sent up Tinseltown. HBO's show Entourage satirised the industry and The Studio comes hard on the heels of another HBO series, The Franchise, about the making of a Marvel Cinematic Universe-style movie. However, The Franchise, although hilarious, was scathing and it was cancelled after just one season. It's difficult to know exactly why it failed to connect with a large enough audience although one reviewer found the show's \"constant cynicism\" very wearing. In contrast, The Studio is affectionate. It has us rooting for Matt and Continental and maybe even for film-making as an artistic endeavour.\n\nAfter all, as Patty tells Matt: \"One week you're looking your idol in the eye and breaking his heart and the next week you're writing a blank cheque for some entitled nepo baby in a beanie. But when it all comes together, and you make a good movie… it's good forever.\" You could say the same for TV shows.\n\nThe Studio begins on Apple TV+ on March 26\n\n--",

        "content": "The art curator saving the world's rarest fruit\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Lucy Lovell Share Save\n\nLucy Lovell (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nFormer Tate Modern director Vicente Todolí founded Todolí Citrus Fundació to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\n\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Buddha's Hand is named for its resemblance to the fingers shown on many Buddha representations (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\n\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\n\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\n\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

More than 64% of the world's travellers are women, with 82% responsible for making a family's travel decisions, according to Skift Research's 2024 The Woman Traveler report. Not only that, but women are also travelling in more ways and to more places than ever before.\n\nSolo female travel is particularly on the rise, with nearly 40% of women travellers planning a solo trip in 2025, according to Skift. This trend also increases with age, as 21% of female travellers aged 55 and up prefer solo travel versus travelling with a spouse or children.\n\n\"Solo travel as a woman feels like a quiet act of rebellion. It is a radical form of self-care, a bold claim to joy and a path to self-actualisation,\" said Lauran Peoples, a director at Richmond Region Tourism in Canada. \"Solo travel allows me to move through the world for no one's benefit but my own. Every time I return, I feel more capable than I give myself credit for. I come back cooler. I come back braver. I come back more in tune with who I truly am.\"\n\nWith their growing financial resources, women are also discerning, choosing destinations with safety, freedom and welcoming cultures in mind.

But compared to men, women have slightly different concerns when planning holidays: safety and cultural attitudes continue to rank top of mind.\n\nAccording to Solo Female Travellers – a company empowering women to travel solo – 66% of female travellers mark safety as their top concern; a figure unchanged since 2020.\n\nThe company's index of more than 200 countries (based on current US/UK advisories, the current Global Peace Index and a survey ranking how solo women travellers viewed their risk while travelling) finds a few places consistently topping the list, including Spain, Australia, the Nordic countries, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan. Japan, which has one of the world's lowest crime rates, ranked number one for safety and stands out as a memorable destination for many solo female travellers.\n\n\"Japan was by far the easiest country I have ever traveled in solo,\" said Georgia Fowkes, a travel expert at Altezza Travel. \"I felt this peculiar but wonderful mix of excitement and utter ease when I arrived in Tokyo. Whether in Shinjuku's buzzing chaos or Kyoto's quiet corners, the streets felt unbelievably safe, even at night.\"\n\nShe found particular ease in women-only train cars and female-focussed capsule hotels. \"It all adds up to a place where you can truly let your guard down and soak it all in,\" she said.\n\nFiona Spinks, who writes the blog Following Fiona, echoes the survey's finding about how female travellers feel welcome in New Zealand. \"Here, it wasn't just about the views (although they're unreal). What stood out most was the people and the way travel in New Zealand often became a real community experience,\" she says. \"When I hiked through the Abel Tasman track, total strangers ended up sharing stories and food. Kiwis love chatting, and you'll gain so much insight from local conversations.\"\n\nTo help support other women-owned businesses on their solo adventures Wanderful, a leading women's travel community, recently launched a map highlighting city guides around the world with women-owned shops, cafes and hotels.\n\nWomen-only group trips\n\n\"Maybe it's the wine, but I laugh more when I travel with women,\" said Kimberlee Lauer, a New Orleans-based senior account executive who travels frequently with her female friends. \"We can be spontaneous and silly together, and we find joy in our shared travel experiences, even when they go awry. I have travelled with my significant others in the past, but I don't really enjoy travelling with men nearly as much as my girlfriends!\"\n\nWhether a girls' getaway or a \"solo-but-not-alone\" trip, group travel built exclusively for women is skyrocketing. Nearly 14% of women are planning a women-only trip in 2025, according to Solo Female Travellers. The survey also found that 36% of women travelled solo on a small group trip, with 8% joining a trip with girlfriends. Road Scholar saw its enrollment in senior-focused women-only tours double in recent years.\n\nMegan Vila, Innovation Manager for TourAxis, recommends women seek out smaller groups and female-led guides. \"Smaller group tours create a more intimate experience and offer a great way to form friendships with other travellers,\" she said. She also recommends itineraries that combine guided activities with plenty of free time. \"Women value expert guidance but also enjoy exploring at their own pace.\"\n\nCruises have emerged as a holiday popular for women, whether already in a group or looking to make new friends. Uniworld recently launched their first women's-only river cruise departing in August 2025 throughout France.\n\n\"Group tours provide something like a tasting menu of different places, so I can see a bit of each city and decide for myself which ones I may want to come back to in the future. I can travel alone, but I'm not actually by myself,\" explained New York resident and frequent group traveller Jessie Parker. \"Get to know the other people in your tour group. There's an instant connection in your choosing the same trip at the same time, so be open to connecting with them as well, not just the location.\"\n\nNatural Habitat Adventures also expanded its women-only itineraries by 75% in 2025, noting that 30% of travellers are women travelling solo. The small, women-led group tours cover destinations like Greenland, Alaska and Costa Rica, focusing on wildlife viewing and highlighting women's history in each destination. Adventure travel continues to be a female-majority space – with women comprising 57% of all adventure travellers.\n\nGetty Images Fit, flush and adventurous, women travellers over 50 seek out set-jetting and bucket list holidays (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSenior travel\n\nWhile solo travel might have once conjured an image of a young, nomadic backpacker, The Woman Traveler Report by Skift recently busted that myth. Only 4% of adults aged 18-24 planned on embarking on solo trips, while nearly 25% of those aged 65 and above planned a similar journey.\n\nAccording to the report's findings, as women reach retirement age, they look forward to travelling to enjoy freedom and flexibility, escape their routines and challenge themselves. According to a 2023 study by Road Scholar, 85% of the operator's solo travellers are women, and 69% of their overall travellers are women. Barring health or mobility issues, many baby boomer women also set their sights on \"bucket list\" travel.\n\n\"With retirement came the precious gift of time, a treasure to be cherished; immersing myself in the moments that fill my heart and nourish my spirit,\" said Venida Hudley, who solo travelled to 12 African countries in 11 months and chronicled her adventures at Venida Discovers Africa. \"My passion was innovation, so I looked for out-of-the-box volunteer opportunities that fed my spirit like volunteering with an innovative fashion designer in Gaborone, Botswana, and volunteering with a business that creatively improves the environment like Gjenge Makers in Nairobi, Kenya.\"\n\nA 2025 AARP report cited Europe as the most popular destination for international baby boomer travel, with Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain and Ireland in the top positions. At Scotland-based small-group tour company Rabbie's, seniors aged 60 and over receive discounted prices, and they've seen senior women most interested in \"set-jetting\", checking out the Downton Abbey Castle or Outlander filming locations in Scotland. \"The real-life history behind these famous locations is often just as captivating as the fictional storylines they have watched on screen,” says Rabbie's CEO Hazel Rickett. \"Take Doune Castle, for example. Known to Outlander fans as Castle Leoch, it has centuries of its own stories to tell. Some driver-guides were even extras in the series, so they offer first-hand insights.\"\n\nGetty Images Cross-generational travel can be a wonderful way to reconnect and create new moments (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nMulti-generational travel\n\nAnother growing trend has been the emergence of cross-generational travel, driven in large part by millennials and Gen-Z parents who are including both their children and their own parents on their travels. According to American Express Travel's 2025 Global Travel Trends, 58% of millennials and Gen-Z parents plan to bring their extended family on trips in 2025, up from just more than 30% of Gen-X and baby boomers.\n\nFemale-focused tour operator Pink Girls Run the World sees a high percentage of its travellers embark as multigenerational trips. \"Plan experiences that can be shared across multiple generations, like afternoon teas,\" suggests founder Tashieka Brewer. \"Over Mother's Day weekend, we're planning a special multi-generational weekend in Bristol, Virginia and we're planning for a unique wine tasting experience at a local vineyard.\"\n\nStephanie Webb of Seesight Tours echoes the sentiment. \"Some of my most meaningful trips have been with family. I took my mom to Italy, where she finally got to see the Amalfi Coast after dreaming about it for years,\" she said. \"Travelling across generations teaches you patience and appreciation. It's about slowing down, choosing activities that suit everyone's energy levels, and focusing on shared experiences rather than just checking off a bucket list. These trips remind me that travel isn't just about the places we see, but the moments we create together.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine\n\n7 March 2025 Share Save Tristan Rutherford Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\n\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The European nation where horses roam free\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Lynn Brown Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOnce considered a nuisance, herds of semi-wild horses roaming the countryside in Bosnia-Herzegovina are now drawing tourists.\n\nThe rock-strewn valleys and rugged mountains of western Bosnia and Herzegovina conceal an elusive and extraordinary sight: herds of semi-wild horses roaming freely across the landscape.\n\nCurrently totalling around 1,000 horses, these herds wander the Cincar Mountains and other areas between the towns of Livno, whose stone-built homes and mosques at the base of Mount Krug are a testament to 400 years of Ottoman rule, and Kupres, the highest city in the country. They're Bosnian Mountain Horses, descendants of domesticated horses that were released into the wild due to various reasons, from war to industrialisation, and have since been saved from extinction.\n\n\"Horses like this were once the backbone of the agricultural industry here,\" BBC Travel Show host Rajan Datar said in a recent episode on the region. \"But once tractors and modern machinery arrived, many farmers set their horses free to fend for themselves in the wild.\"\n\nRajan Datar explores a secret tunnel that protected citizens during the seige of Sarajevo.\n\nBecause of their domesticated roots, the horses are less wary of humans than true wild horses, which has made them a draw for tourists but also a source of tension. In winter, they can often be found licking salt from roads in the winter, becoming a danger both to drivers and themselves. They have also been known to raid local farms for food, destroying crops and stealing water from livestock. Many locals see them as a nuisance, and some farmers have even gone so far as to kill horses found on their land. A 2009 decision to protect the herds was rescinded in 2017 due to the overwhelming cost of the damage claims.\n\nAlamy Wild horses Livno Bosnia Herzegovina: Tourism has helped both Livno’s wild horses and the town itself thrive (Credit: Alamy)\n\nYet, in recent years, attitudes have begun to shift. As tourism to the country has increased in the past two decades, so has visitor interest in the animals. Their nomadic nature means that local guides are necessary to view the horses, and a host of local tourism businesses have cropped up to meet this demand, creating a significant economic impact in this rural region.\n\nLocal community organisations, such as the Environmental Association of Borova Glava, have also stepped in to help care for the animals and mitigate conflicts. For volunteers like Zeljko Kristo, a spokesperson for the organisation, the horses also serve as a symbol of how the country has healed from the war, which raged from 1992 to 1995 following the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n\"Besides humans, horses also found themselves in an awkward situation because [of the war],\" he explained. \"Looking back, years have passed, and we managed to save them – but at the same time, we saved ourselves.\"\n\nFor travellers interested in seeing the horses, Livno is the best place to start. The animals are commonly found roaming the hills and valleys around this part of the country, but their movements can be unpredictable. To increase the chance of seeing them, it's highly recommended that visitors hire a guide, who will be more knowledgeable about the horses' movements and habits. Local tour companies also provide transportation from town to the more remote areas where the herds can be found. What's more, many of these businesses donate some of the proceeds from their tours to the care of the animals, ensuring they can continue to roam these wild landscapes for years to come.\n\n--",

        "content": "There's an AI physio seeing patients in the UK. Can it fix my back?\n\n1 day ago Share Save Scott Nover Share Save\n\nEstudio Santa Rita/ BBC (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)\n\nBack pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up?\n\nWhen I hurt my back in October 2024, the cause wasn't immediately clear. Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.\n\nWhatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.\n\nBy mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of \"lumbar radiculopathy\". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process – I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common – and debilitating – as lower back pain.\n\nSince early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.\n\nI specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.\n\nThe service, provided by a company called Flok Health, is the first artificial intelligence clinic – of any kind – to be trialled by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It's been approved for use by the country’s Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, and began seeing patients – just like me – at the end of 2024.\n\nFlok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate. It's a noble mission, but I had one question: Was AI really the answer?\n\nEstudio Santa Rita/BBC By guiding users through a series of stretches and movements, the app is designed to help patients manage their own pain (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)\n\nIn addition to being a trained doctor, Finn Stevenson spent time as a professional rower in Great Britain's Olympic development programme. Anyone who has rowed before – or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym – knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.\n\n\"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people,\" says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. \"In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio. If I was struggling, other people probably were too.\"\n\nStevenson and Ric da Silva, now his co-founder and Flok's chief technology officer, met when they were early employees at a company called CMR Surgical, a British startup where the pair worked on building robotics for soft-tissue surgery.\n\nBut with Flok, they are aiming to provide treatment to people who don't need surgery. They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases.\n\n\"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication,\" says da Silva. \"What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem.\"\n\nThe idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.\n\nThis AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion intervention combinations\n\nWhen I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.\n\nBut rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers.\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. \"We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning,\" says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the next word in a sequence, there isn't a risk of the so-called hallucination problem in AI where an algorithm makes things up – a major concern about AI in the medical field.\n\nInstead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion \"intervention combinations\", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.\n\nIt's a \"perfect software problem\", says Stevenson. \"Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way.\"\n\nEstudio Santa Rita/BBC Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of disability around the world (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)\n\nFlok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health.\n\nBut it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing clinical trials in the US as an add-on to more typical care services.\n\nNot entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that it can help to reduce pain among those who use it. But a recent trial found slow adoption rates – nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care not as a replacement.\n\nEven so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a potentially promising approach to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.\n\n\"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of,\" says Stuart. \"We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions.\"\n\nStuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. \"With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting,\" she says.\n\nShe contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, \"changing under the hood\" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says.\n\nPranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. \"What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a clear division of labor,\" he says. \"When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their combined accuracy is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. Clean separation of responsibilities side steps these issues.\"\n\nHer pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches – they rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss\n\nIn Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.\n\nRajpurkar predicts that eventually \"we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains\". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.\n\n\"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered,\" says Rajpurkar.\n\nIn our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways – following her careful lead on the screen – in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable.\n\nThis isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong – which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions – a real voice behind the curtain.\n\nMy back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times – if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future – but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "A network of progressive non-profits has quietly spent years pushing the IRS’s new “Direct File” service.\n\nProgressive supporters of Direct File claim to advocate for low-income taxpayers. Research shows that key organizations promoting Direct File are closely tied to Arabella Advisors and its billion-dollar network of left-leaning dark money groups.\n\nOne Arabella-backed organization, the Economic Security Project (ESP), has funded advertising and research in support of Direct File. Last year, the group received a $752,197 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to “conduct research on the impact and usage” of Direct File.\n\nThat work culminated in a media blitz encouraging largely low-income taxpayers to adopt Direct File, which was first made available as a pilot program in 2024 for taxpayers across a dozen states. Last year, the IRS agreed to make the program permanent, but it has since come under fire from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump-appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed to temporarily keep the program through the 2025 tax season, earning him praise from progressive groups including ESP.\n\nESP is fiscally sponsored by the Hopewell Fund, a nonprofit managed by Arabella Advisors. The arrangement allows ESP to operate as a project of the Hopewell Fund, taking advantage of Hopewell’s nonprofit status without having to register with the IRS or publicly disclose its own finances.\n\nESP’s goal isn’t simply to make filing taxes easier. Adam Ruben, a former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who is now managing outreach for the group, called Direct File “[o]ne of the best tools we have to create the infrastructure for guaranteed income in this country” and said Direct File “is a huge opportunity for economic security and racial equity.”\n\nGroundwork Collaborative, another non-profit receiving funding through the Arabella Network, has led its own media blitz supporting Direct File. Groundwork Action, the group’s advocacy arm, funded a “Better IRS” ad campaign promoting direct file and attacking private-sector tax preparers. Like ESP, Groundwork is led by a former policy advisor to Elizabeth Warren.\n\nESP and Groundwork help fund and operate The Coalition for Free and Fair Filing, which “supports the Internal Revenue Service’s efforts to create a free online direct tax filing tool,” according to the group’s website. “The coalition is composed of organizations committed to racial and economic justice, consumer protection, the advancement of civic technology and the promotion of equity in tax administration.”\n\nSupporters of Direct File frame it, in part, as an effort to help low-income tax filers and also as a better way to ensure collection of higher tax revenues by the IRS.\n\nCritics of Direct File highlight the inherent conflict of interest in having the IRS prepare people’s tax returns. Last year, a group of Republican Senators challenged the IRS’s ability to unilaterally launch such a program, saying “[s]erious legal questions exist about the IRS Direct File launch,” which was undertaken without Congressional approval.\n\nThe IRS initially received funding for a pilot program for an in-house tax filing tool through the Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Direct File was made available to users in 12 states. For 2025, availability has expanded to 32 million taxpayers in 25 states.\n\nJacob McLeod is a researcher and writer focusing primarily on corruption in politics.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The Nation justice correspondent Elie Mystal said Monday on “Morning Joe” that when in power, Democrat lawmakers should change the law so “if you’re eligible to vote, you should be automatically registered to vote.”\n\nMystal said, “We could eliminate all voter registration laws. See, when Democrats get in charge, we try to protect voting rights. We don’t make voting easier. Now, I’m all for voter eligibility requirements. We might disagree about what those requirements should be, but you know, I’m going to say that, like, there should be an age limit to vote. I might say 16, you might say 18, but I’m not going to say 8, right? So we’re going to agree that there should be voter eligibility requirements.”\n\nHe continued, “But once you’re eligible, why do you have to pre-register? why why is that even a thing? It wasn’t a thing in this country at the founding. We didn’t have voter registration in 1787. We didn’t have voter registration in 1821. We only started having voter registration generally speaking, after the Civil War. Why do you think that is? It’s because a bunch of freed African slaves were migrating up north, and all of a sudden New York was like, we need some registration up in here, right? A bunch of immigrants from Europe, mainly Ireland and Italy, were coming to New York. People were like, oh, we need some registration in here. If you’re eligible to vote, you should be automatically registered to vote. That is how they do it everywhere else but us. Everywhere else but us either has automatic registration or some other form of forced registration for everybody, so that you don’t have this disconnect between eligible voters and registered voters.”\n\nMystal added, “That’s the first law in the book that we could change and see how that’s different than just saying we have to protect voting rights. No, we don’t have to protect voting rights. We have to expand voting rights so that the 90 million people that sat on the couch and sat out this last election between democracy and fascism, so that maybe they have a little bit of an easier time to get up off the couch and come participate in the democracy.”\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

        "content": "On Monday’s broadcast of WBUR’s “Here and Now,” Columbia University Professor Reinhold Martin, who also serves as President of Columbia’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, but was speaking for only himself, reacted to pushes by the Trump administration over campus antisemitism by stating that “We’re in New York in 2025 with echoes of Frankfurt and Berlin in 1933. That’s the context in which we need to understand this.”\n\nCo-host Scott Tong asked, [relevant exchange begins around 3:25] “Professor, as you know, this administration has warned some 60 other universities that their federal funding could be withheld if they don’t address what the administration considers antisemitic harassment on campus. What are you watching at campuses across the country now?”\n\nMartin responded, “Right. Well, this is where I think we’re seeing, already, faculty standing up. And I know, from expressions of solidarity that we’ve received from all over the country that eyes are on Columbia, understandably so. But we can’t do this alone. Faculties and students around the country who are concerned about these attacks need to stand up together. That’s happening, and I think you’ll see more of it. Because Columbia cannot be the first domino to fall.”\n\nTong then asked what kind of help Martin needs.\n\nMartin responded, “We need a little more robust public and political action on the part of public officials, on the part of academic administrators. Right now, our public officials have not been especially robust in defending the institutions of higher education to which they send — many of them send their children. So, this is a moment of truth. We’re in New York in 2025 with echoes of Frankfurt and Berlin in 1933. That’s the context in which we need to understand this. … And so, we need to understand this as a concerted assault that was scripted in Project 2025 and elsewhere, and now it’s being executed on the institution of higher education in the United States, not just one institution, Columbia, but universities and colleges as such.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione’s lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.\n\nDefense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there’s “no connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.”\n\nMangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.\n\nMangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn’t entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson’s death.\n\nThompson’s killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.\n\nBut at the same time, the case channeled some Americans’ frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione’s writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.\n\nSome people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.\n\nThrough his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.\n\nIf he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday’s filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.\n\nOtherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren’t enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

Today they announced two board members, Bashar-al-Assad and Skeletor.” John Mulaney: “Welcome to the Kennedy Center, or as it will be known next week, the Roy Cohn Pavilion for big strong men.” Sarah Silverman: “I just really miss the days when you were America’s only orange asshole.”\n\nTriumph the Insult Comic Dog emceed the evening, greeting the audience with, “Thank you all for coming, and shame on you for being here.”\n\nThat was a reference to all of the artists who have allegedly canceled shows at the Kennedy Center in protest, including the producers of Hamilton.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Trump announced last month he had appointed himself Chairman of the Kennedy Center, adding he had cleaned house of several members of the Board of Trustees.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump revealed plans to “make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN,” adding he was making changes, such as bringing an end to drag shows featured at the Kennedy Center “targeting” children.\n\nTrump described the Kennedy Center as being “an American Jewel,” adding it “must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage.”",

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) denied playing any role in promoting the violence waged against Elon Musk’s brand, Tesla.\n\nThe Texas Democrat acknowledged participating in the so-called “Tesla takedown,” which she maintained was a “large protest.”\n\n“So, I’m actually going to say that I participated in a Tesla takedown,” she said. “That is the name of the website. And it was all about this large protest that they’re calling for. And this is a nonviolent protest that they’re calling for. And in fact, when I was on there, which is why the attorney general had to say that I wasn’t calling for violence, and it’s ridiculous that I even have to say something like that. But because they are trying to twist our words, one of the things that I told people to do is make sure you are adhering to the laws in your area. Make sure you know what it looks like to protest and to be able to raise your voices and to exercise your constitutional right to free speech. And what we see is that they want to dull our free speech rights. They want to make sure that those that are participating in the press—because we saw that there have been recent attacks specifically on this news organization—they want y’all to kind of tamp down what you say and hopefully buy into the lies instead of going out there and just telling the truth.”\n\nCrockett continued, “And so, yeah, I’m excited to see that Elon Musk, that his money as it relates to Tesla, well, Tesla’s tanking right now. And I’m OK with that. So, just in case the slow people listening decide to clip this up later, I just want to say that I have never promoted violence whatsoever, yet I’ve also never made excuses for those violent actors such as the ones on January 6. So, Pam Bondi, if you have an issue with terrorism, maybe you should talk to your boss about locking back up those guys that he let out that participated in January 6.”\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on X @jeff_poor",

Trump also spoke about how his administration was finding “fraudulent contracts,” and noted that Musk and his team at DOGE had “caught” many fraudulent contracts.\n\n“A case of fraud was with the Small Business Administration, where they were handing out loans — $330 million worth of loans to people under the age of 11,” Musk revealed. “I think the youngest, Kelly, was a nine-month year old who got a $100,000 loan. That’s a very precocious baby we’re talking about here.”\n\nIn a post on X, Musk responded to a post from the DOGE account which revealed that the SBA was now requiring “date of birth collection for all direct loan applications,” and was pausing “the direct loan process for those under 18 and above 120 years old.”\n\n“No more loans to babies or people too old to be alive,” Musk wrote in his post.\n\nBreitbart News’s Hannah Knudsen reported on Friday that DOGE revealed it had cancelled “105 more contracts, with a ceiling value of $935 million.”\n\nThe DOGE website currently states that roughly 6,637 contracts have been terminated, totaling “$20B in savings.”\n\nPer DOGE’s website:\n\nThe contracts listed below have been posted publicly on fpds.gov. FPDS posting of the contract termination notices can have up to a 1 month lag. There may be discrepencies [sic] between FPDS / USAspending and the posted numbers, the latter of which originate directly from agency contracting and grant officials.\n\nDuring the cabinet meeting, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins revealed that the USDA had “cancelled a $300,000 contract educating on food justice for queer and transgender farmers in San Francisco,” among other things.\n\n“A similar contract we cancelled in New York — again, educating transgender and queer farmers on food justice and food equality,” Rollins added. “I’m not even sure what that means, but apparently the last administration wanted to put our taxpayer dollars towards that.”",

        "content": "During an interview with ABC News on Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reacted to a report on members of the Trump administration allegedly sharing sensitive details on strikes in Yemen on a group chat that had Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg mistakenly on it by stating that “this was obviously a mess, to add a reporter to this Signal chain. And I feel confident it’s not something that will happen again.” And responded to a question on whether he’d support Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) call for an investigation into the matter by stating that Schumer is engaging in “political attacks.”\n\nCruz said, “Well, listen, this was obviously a mess, to add a reporter to this Signal chain. And I feel confident it’s not something that will happen again.”\n\nCruz then praised the Trump administration for taking action against the Houthis.\n\nHost Linsey Davis then asked, “Minority Leader Schumer has called for an investigation into how this could have happened. Would you support one?”\n\nCruz responded, “Well, listen, it doesn’t surprise me that Chuck Schumer’s immediate response is [to] engage in political attacks. That’s, apparently, all the Democrats are about today is political attacks, and Schumer has a real incentive to do that, because his left flank, he’s got AOC threatening to primary him right now, and he’s worried about his left flank. I’ve got to say, I’m curious why Schumer and the Democrats are not concerned about the fact that, for the last four years, the Houthis have been allowed to engage in terrorism against America, against America’s allies, to drive up costs for consumers.”\n\nHe added, “[I]t was clearly a screw-up. It was obvious that including Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertent, and that was a mess and an embarrassing mess. But I will say, there’s a big difference, in that, immediately, the Trump White House took responsibility, they said this was genuine, this was a real exchange, and it was a mistake. And that taking responsibility, that was the right thing to do. It’s very different from [what] Hillary Clinton and the Democrats did, where they obfuscated, they denied, they tried to hide the thing for months upon months upon months.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

        "title": "Pollak: Klein and Thompson’s ‘Abundance’ Offers Democrats Criticism — and More Utopian Thinking",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s new book, Abundance, is gaining attention because it includes an unusually frank admission that Democrats have failed because they have placed other priorities ahead of economic growth.\n\nThe book, however, repeats the central mistake of liberalism under the Democratic Party, which is to presume that the role of government is to move the country towards utopia, rather than to protect its citizens from basic dangers and disaster.\n\nKlein and Thompson’s criticisms matter because they are decidedly on the left of the political spectrum. Klein played a particularly important role in pushing for Obamacare during the heated debates of 2009-10.\n\nThat utopian policy — universal health care! — failed to reduce the cost of health insurance, or to preserve patient choice, as advertised. It did expand insurance coverage, but largely by expanding Medicaid — an expansion that continues in some Democrat-run states to the point of insolvency.\n\nCalifornia, for example, has to borrow over $6 billion this month alone to cover shortfalls in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. The reason: California expanded Medi-Cal to illegal aliens.\n\nKlein and Thompson dismiss concerns about migration, but it is a major reason Democrat-run governments are failing.\n\nFor all their truth-telling, Obamacare merits one mention — one! — in the book: “The Affordable Care Act subsidizes insurance that people can use to pay for health care.”\n\nThe authors deserve credit for admitting that deep-blue cities and states are failing. They note, for example, that Democrats often undermine their own policies by insisting that major public infrastructure projects also satisfy a long list of criteria (union labor, climate offsets, minority contracts) that prevents them from being built on time, under budget, or at all.\n\nThe conservatives may not be right about everything, but they have a point, the authors admit.\n\nCrucially, Klein and Thompson also argue that today’s liberals have adopted an unnecessary and artificial presumption of scarcity. They seem to know that this is because of the religious dogma of climate change, which they share. They try to reform that orthodoxy, emphasizing investment rather than regulation, and technology that could unite “the life Americans want with the clean energy the planet could tolerate.”\n\nLiberals need to reject scarcity, and embrace abundance, they argue.\n\nThis sounds new, but in fact it shares much with the original spirit of “democratic socialism” in the United States, which argues that an economic system that has failed in every other country where it has been tried will succeed in America because of the great abundance of wealth that generations of capitalism have produced.\n\nKlein and Thompson share something else with socialism — namely, the belief that society can be pushed, or at least nudged, by a wise and powerful government toward an ideal condition.\n\nIt is difficult to take that proposition seriously, especially reading the book — as I did last weekend — from the home to which my family and I have been relocated due to the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles in January.\n\nOur state, the fifth-richest economy in the world and home to the most advanced technology humanity has ever invented, failed to provide the water, or the men, necessary to fight the fires.\n\nNever mind utopia; we don’t get the basics right here.\n\nSpeaking of the Golden State, Klein and Thompson let Governor Gavin Newsom off the hook. The authors almost laud Newsom for his willingness to admit that there is a problem with Democratic governance. They note that he wisely ended the doomed high-speed rail system that was to have connected San Francisco and L.A. But they blame “negotiating” for the delays in building Newsom’s scaled-down, rural version of the project.\n\nThey admit that the high-speed rail project would never have been built at all, had it been proposed in its present form — then lament that it is taking so long.\n\nAt some point, harder questions have to be asked about leadership, about competence — and about corruption. Indeed, President Donald Trump is auditing California’s high-speed rail project to understand where all the money went.\n\nCalifornia’s failures matter, because Newsom is likely running for president in 2028 — hence his turn to podcasting, as his state burns. He is running on cultural issues, not on his record, because after a lifetime in office, he has no record. Over his tenure, California has neglected forestry, policing, infrastructure, water storage, elementary education — the first priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the state is burning — so badly, and so frequently, that it is losing six times more carbon from federal land than any other state.\n\nThe cost of utopia, for my neighbors, is the destruction of thousands of individual dreams.\n\nWe have “abundance.” We lack the basics. Write a book for Democrats about that.\n\nJoel B.

Here are the facts about his latest story: 1. No “war plans” were discussed. 2. No classified material was sent to the thread. 3. The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump’s top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible. As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective.

The APD reportedly labeled the devices as being “incendiary.”\n\nFox News reported that the police issued a statement that the devices “were taken into police custody without incident.”\n\n“This is an open and ongoing investigation,” the statement added, according to the outlet.\n\nBreitbart News’s Lucas Nolan previously reported that due to the ongoing attacks on Tesla vehicles and dealerships throughout the nation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning calling for people to “report any suspicious activity,” they see.\n\nThe Boston Hearld reports that the FBI has released an alert following a spate of incidents involving Tesla electric vehicles and dealerships nationwide. The bureau reported that since January 2025, at least nine states, including Massachusetts, have seen instances of arson, gunfire, and vandalism targeting Elon Musk’s EV company. According to the FBI, the public should be on the lookout for suspicious activity near Tesla dealerships, storage lots, and charging stations. The incidents have involved lone offenders using rudimentary tactics such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, often occurring at night with apparently little planning.\n\nLast week, two Tesla dealerships in Las Vegas, Nevada and Kansas City, Missouri were attacked, with vehicles being damaged and set ablaze.\n\nPrior to this, an arsonist in Seattle “doused a Tesla EV with gasoline and set it on fire.”\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, at the beginning of January, a Tesla Cybertruck sitting outside of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas was seen engulfed in flames.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently purchased a Tesla from Elon Musk as part of “a show of confidence and support” for Musk, as he has continued to face attacks.",

        "content": "The editor-in-chief of the anti-Trump The Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg was reportedly added to a group chat with Trump cabinet members and other top officials that was created by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to coordinate potential United States military strikes against Houthis two days before they happened, according to the magazine.\n\nAccording to The Atlantic, Waltz reportedly set up the group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal on March 13 to coordinate the strikes, and appeared to have accidentally added Goldberg to it.\n\nThe 18 members of the group chat included Waltz, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, someone believed to be Homeland Security Advisor and White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, and others.\n\nThe group chat was called “Houthi PC small group,” with PC meaning “Principles Committee” — a reference to the group of top decision-makers from each agency during National Security Council meetings.\n\nWaltz reportedly sent the following message on March 13:\n\nTeam — establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening. Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.\n\nMembers of the group chat then sent names for points of contact for them on the strikes.\n\nThe next day, Waltz told the group they should have received messages in their classified computer and communications systems regarding taskings.\n\nGoldberg said a “fascinating policy discussion commenced.”\n\nVance said regarding the strikes, “I think we are making a mistake,” adding, “3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\n“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.,” he argued.\n\nA person identified as former CIA official and retired Green Beret Chief Warrant Officer 2 Joe Kent, Trump’s nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center, wrote, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nRatcliffe then reportedly sent a message that “contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.”\n\nHegseth reportedly wrote, “VP: I understand your concerns — and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what — nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nHe reportedly added, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first — or Gaza cease fire falls apart — and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC—operations security. I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nWaltz then reportedly posted a “lengthy note” about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies.\n\n“Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans,” Waltz said.\n\nVance then reportedly wrote to Hegseth, “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”\n\nHegseth responded: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nThe person identified as potentially Miller wrote, “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nHegseth reportedly responded, “Agree.”\n\nOn the morning of the strikes, Hegseth reportedly posted an update that allegedly contained operational details of the forthcoming strikes against the Houthis that included targets, types of weapons, and attack sequencing.\n\nVance reportedly responded, “I will say a prayer for victory,” and two others added a prayer emoji.\n\nGoldberg said two hours later, explosions were being heard across the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.\n\nThe group chat members then congratulated Hegseth and the military and discussed assessments of the damage, including the likely death of a specific individual.\n\nGoldberg said he then removed himself from the chat and then sent several of its members questions.\n\nBrian Hughes, National Security Council spokesman, responded two hours later, confirming the group chat was real.\n\n“This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” he said. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said, “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations.”\n\nHe added, “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump was asked about the report, to which he responded, “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business… You’re telling me about it for the first time.”\n\nGoldberg is the journalist who published a hoax story claiming Trump called slain U.S. veterans “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X”, Truth Social, or on Facebook.",

        "content": "An investigation into an alleged cartel training ground and killing field in western Mexico has led authorities to uncover how one of the world’s most violent cartels used TikTok to recruit its gunmen.\n\nThis week, Mexico’s Public Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch revealed details about the March 20 arrest of Jose Gregorio “Comandante Lastra” Lastra Hermida, one of the lead recruiters for Cartel Jalisco New Generation. Lastra was directly under Gonzalo “El 90 or El Sapo” Mendoza Gaytan, the regional leader for CJNG in the states of Jalisco, Nayarit, and Zacatecas.\n\nAccording to Harfuch, Lastra and his associates used more than 39 TikTok accounts to reach out to hundreds of individuals and lure them with false job offers. The group offered the candidates between 4,000 and 12,000 pesos per week.\n\nThose who accepted the offers were then asked to meet at bus stations, from where CJNG gunmen would take them to Rancho Izaguirre. Once there, the individuals had their phones taken and were provided with tactical gear and clothing for a month-long training session as CJNG gunmen. After the training, the gunmen were sent to various parts of Mexico to bolster the organization’s ranks.\n\nAs Breitbart Texas reported, Rancho Izaguirre has sparked international outrage after activists reported discovering hundreds of shoes and other personal items from the property, which was reportedly used as a cartel killing field, incineration site, and mass grave.\n\nAs part of the ongoing investigations into Rancho Izaguirre, authorities reported the arrest of Comandante Lastra and 48 others tied to CJNG recruiting and training operations. According to Harfuch, Lastra was the head of recruiting and training from May 2024 until this month’s arrest.\n\nEditor’s Note: Breitbart News Foundation traveled to Mexico City and the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The following content is sponsored by Pinpoint Policy Institute.\n\nThere are only a few weeks left for Congress to overturn President Joe Biden’s overdraft fee cap rule, which would debank low-income Americans.\n\nOne of Biden’s parting gifts was to pull a rug out from under low-income bank customers’ feet. By finalizing a rule that effectively ends the use of overdraft, Americans lose a banking service without receiving any perceptible benefit.\n\nOut of all of Biden’s egregious ideas, one of the most deleterious is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) rule to cap overdraft fees—effectively killing the service altogether. The CFPB’s arbitrary overdraft rule allows the CFPB to dictate overdraft fees by capping them at $5.00. This is a government-mandated price control that removes any incentive for banks to offer the service to customers—effectively eliminating a banking service for Americans. Congress acknowledges that price controls are regressive and create shortages. In this case the shortage is the availability to overdraw a bank account when an emergency arises.\n\nLow-income Americans aim to lose the most if the overdraft rule is finalized. Imposing a government-mandated price control will prevent American families from being able to maintain a bank account. A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concludes that an overdraft fee cap results in a loss of overdraft coverage “and a decline in account ownership among low-income households.” Biden’s overdraft rule harms the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nFormer CFPB director Rohit Chopra, a protégé of radical liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), finalized the overdraft rule just a few weeks before President Donald Trump was sworn into office. Chopra clearly frontloaded the rule before Trump took office—an eleventh-hour shenanigan aimed at undermining Trump’s pro-growth agenda.\n\nFortunately, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. French Hill (R-AR) are leading the charge to repeal the overdraft rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). If Congress passes the joint resolution of disapproval, and President Trump signs it, lower income families throughout the country will continue to have options when it comes to banking, and the administrative state will not be able to produce substantially similar rules in the future.\n\nThe overdraft rule is a symptom of a larger issue, the existence of the CFPB itself. Time and again the CFPB has attempted to expand its own power without Congress’s approval. Left-wing unelected bureaucrats have run the CFPB since its inception and have issued rule-makings that would ruin America’s economic growth. Examples of this include rules that prohibit consideration of medical debt in credit reports, rules to control data brokers, and rules that would allow the agency to scrutinize your Venmo account. All these actions impinge on Americans’ freedoms and civil liberties.\n\nConservatives strongly oppose the CFPB and its actions. Elon Musk and DOGE have gutted the agency while Vivek Ramaswamy explicitly called on Trump to “nullify” the overdraft rule. Additionally, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced legislation to zero out the CFPB’s funding, codifying the abolishment of the agency.\n\nThe radical left is intent on controlling Americans by telling them what they think is best. Paternalism at its finest. Congress has a chance to reject liberal policies by overturning the Biden administration’s overdraft rule. But the clock is ticking. There are only a few weeks left for the Senate to use the CRA’s fast-track rules to repeal Biden-era rules that were finalized toward the end of 2024. The fast-track rules allow the Senate to pass a disapproval resolution with only a simple majority, instead of the usual 60 vote threshold. The House Committee on Financial Services already passed the joint resolution to repeal the overdraft rule, but now the full House of Representatives must pass the resolution and send it to the Senate.\n\nAmericans should be given more banking options, not less. The government mandate on overdraft is a disaster waiting to happen. Members of Congress have a chance to act quickly and protect their constituents from a radical left-wing takeover of their bank accounts. Time is of the essence.",

In comparison, at the same time last year, 4,306 had illegally crossed the waterway. By March 22nd of 2023, 3,683 illegals had crossed the Channel, and in 2022, 3,836 reached Britain via the illegal migrant route.\n\nThe 28 per cent increase in illegal crossings over last year may cast further doubt on Prime Minsiter Sir Keir Starmer’s promise to end the crisis.\n\nRather than simply returning illegal boat migrants to France, Starmer’s government has instead ploughed £150 million into schemes to “smash the gangs” of people smuggling networks facilitating the passage of illegal migrants across the Channel.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: “The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice.”\n\nIn another apparent failure to fulfil commitments made to the public by the Labour government, a document released from the Treasury has found that 8,000 more alleged asylum seekers are living in hotels than when Prime Minister Starmer came into office, the Times of London reported.\n\nDespite Starmer vowing during the campaign to “end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds”, the Treasury document predicted that due to “global instability”, illegal migrants will continue to pour into the country, and therefore, the scheme of putting them up in hotels will continue for years.\n\nAt present, over 38,000 illegals are being housed at taxpayer expense in hotels across the country at an average cost of £145 per night, or £5.5 million per day.\n\nThis has been a major driver of the increased cost to the government for asylum seekers, with the average cost soaring per migrant from £17,000 to £41,000 since 2020.\n\nIn addition to the hotel migrants, around 65,700 migrants are also being put up in what are called “dispersal accommodations,” such as houses or apartments across the country, at a cost of around £14 per person per night, or around £920,000 in total every day.\n\nIn a tacit admission of a critique long levied by sceptics of mass migration—that vast areas of the countryside will need to be paved over to make room for migrants—the Treasury document surmised that the leftist government’s plans to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 may help alleviate the need to use hotels to house asylum seekers.",

        "content": "The United States Senate on Monday afternoon confirmed businessman John Phelan as the 79th Secretary of the United States Navy in a bipartisan 62-30 vote.\n\nAll 51 Republican senators voted for Phelan, as well as 11 Democrat senators, including the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed (RI) — a notable feat during a time of heightened political contentiousness between Democrats and the Trump administration.\n\nPhelan is a Harvard Business School graduate and the founder and chairman of the private investment firm Rugger Management LLC, and previously was the co-founding partner and chief investment officer of MSD Capital, a private investment firm managing the capital of Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies.\n\nAlthough Phelan did not serve in the military, he is expected to bring his vast business expertise and acumen to help fix the Navy’s most pressing problems in ship building and maintenance, particularly as China seeks to build a navy rivaling the U.S.’s.\n\nAt his February 27 confirmation hearing, Phelan said the Navy was at a “crossroads,” with extended deployments, inadequate maintenance, huge cost overruns, delayed ship building, failed audits, subpar housing and record-high suicide rates.\n\n“These are systemic failures that have gone unaddressed for far too long. Frankly, this is unacceptable,” he said. “The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks. … My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it, step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.”\n\nPhelan, a Floridian and personal friend of Trump’s, was the first of all the service secretaries to be nominated and the second to be confirmed after Army Secretary Dan Driscoll. Phelan will be sworn into office in the next few days.\n\nIn his nomination announcement on November 26, Trump said of Phelan:\n\nIt is my great honor to announce John Phelan as our next United States Secretary of the Navy! John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision. He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else.\n\nJohn has excelled in every endeavor, from founding and leading Rugger Management LLC, to co-founding MSD Capital, LP, the Private Investment Firm for Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies. His Record of Success speaks for itself – A true Champion of American Enterprise and Ingenuity! John’s intelligence and leadership are unmatched. John holds an MBA from the Harvard Business School, and is a truly brilliant guy! His incredible knowledge and experience will elevate the lives of the brave Americans who serve our Nation. John will deliver real results for our Navy and our Country. I look forward to working with him. Congratulations, John – Together, we will MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!\n\nCongratulations poured in for Phelan after his confirmation.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X, “Congratulations John Phelan on being Confirmed as the 79th Secretary of the Navy! Looking forward to supporting our warfighters together.”\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) posted, “Our incredible @USNavy is second to none! As Secretary of the Navy, John Phelan will build a lethal force to defend our interests around the world. I look forward to working with him to ensure our Sailors and Marines have the resources they need to meet pressing and evolving threats.\n\nNavy veteran Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) posted, “CONFIRMED: Secretary of the Navy John Phelan. As our military faces increasingly complicated challenges, John will bring an entrepreneurial skillset and fresh thinking to the Navy.”\n\nSen. Ashley Moody (R-FL), who replaced Secretary of State Marco Rubio, posted, “John Phelan is an excellent pick to lead the @USNavy. He has committed to returning our military to the lethal fighting force that it is meant to be. I am proud to have supported this fellow Floridian on his confirmation this evening.”\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) posted:\n\nCongratulations to John Phelan on his Senate confirmation to be Secretary of the Navy. John will become Secretary of the Navy at a crucial time in our naval history. I am committed to working closely with him to revitalize American shipbuilding, bolster the size of our Naval fleet, and improve the readiness of our Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nAnother Navy veteran, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), posted, “Proud to vote yes to confirm my friend John Phelan as Secretary of the Navy. John knows what it takes to turn an organization around, and I have no doubt that he will work with President Trump to increase lethality with incredible ships, and take care of our Sailors and Marines.”\n\n\n\nAerospace Industries Association President and CEO Eric Fanning, who served as Army Secretary under the Obama administration, also congratulated him.\n\n“The Aerospace Industries Association congratulates the new Secretary of the Navy, John Phelan, on his confirmation today. Secretary Phelan’s business acumen will infuse the Navy with a strategic approach to expanding our fleet to meet deterrence needs across the world, especially in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.\n\n“His commitment to readiness, effectiveness, and efficiency aligns seamlessly with our industry’s priorities. We look forward to collaborating with Secretary Phelan to ensure our Sailors are equipped with the finest equipment in the world.”\n\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X”, Truth Social, or on Facebook.",

It’s more than just a gripping story. a serious blunder. the article raises serious legal implications for all of these national security officials.”\n\nShe asked, “Did this group chat break the law?”\n\nRaskin said, “Most certainly it did and it reflects a general sloppiness and negligence in the whole approach of the administration. As they’ve gotten started here they’ve been struck down more than 40 different times by federal courts with temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, because they’ve acted in such a cavalier disregard of what the rule of law requires.”\n\nHe continued, “And this example you’re pointing to, Kasie, obviously, is with respect to operational implementation of some plans. But if you look at what the underlying plan was, it’s Congress that declares war on Venezuela or on Yemen. It’s not the President of the United States. So it’s both this tremendous operational negligence and sloppiness that has been shown, but also the idea that they act in complete defiance of what the Constitution says and what the rule of law stands for.”\n\nRaskin added, “Our democracy is under siege and as we’ve seen, dozens of actions by the Trump administration have been struck down in federal court as a violation of the Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nHe concluded, “We’re really in the fight of our lives right now.”\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

        "title": "Report: U.S. Warns Egypt to Accept Gazans or Lose Billions in Aid",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s administration has delivered a “final offer” to Egypt to accept up to 700,000 Gazans, according to a new report which says the proposal includes billions of dollars in economic aid and a warning that the same deal will be offered elsewhere if Cairo refuses.\n\nOn Monday, the U.K.-based and Qatari-owned Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that the U.S. message was relayed through U.A.E. President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during a visit to Cairo over the weekend.\n\nAccording to the Arab outlet, Washington’s proposal would see Egypt receive a major financial package in exchange for absorbing 500,000 to 700,000 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe report cited a source familiar with the discussions, who claimed that the United States not only offered massive aid to bolster Egypt’s struggling economy but also issued a stark ultimatum: If Egypt rejects the proposal, both the financial support and refugee resettlement deal will be transferred to another willing nation.\n\nThe same source reportedly said that a refusal could result in the loss of existing U.S. aid to Egypt, which totals over $1.5 billion annually, including $1.3 billion towards military assistance. Cairo has so far resisted efforts to resettle displaced Gazans.\n\nThe matter comes as Israel remains locked in conflict with Hamas following the October 7 massacre — the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history, which saw thousands of terrorists burst into Israel from Gaza and gun down participants of an outdoor music festival. Other terrorists simultaneously went door to door in local towns hunting for Jewish men, women, and children who were then subject to kidnapping, torture, rape, execution, and immolation.\n\nLast month, President Trump unveiled his vision for the Gaza Strip during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His plan calls for resettling the strip’s population and rebuilding the territory into a thriving economic hub, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy and setting the stage for a bold new strategy in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael has since announced a new department to oversee the voluntary relocation of Gaza residents to third-party countries, a move ordered by Defense Minister Israel Katz. The plan aligns with Trump’s approach, emphasizing regional solutions over past failed policies.\n\n“I welcome President Trump’s bold initiative,” Katz stated, calling it an opportunity for Gazans to seek a better future while ensuring Israel’s security.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Jerusalem Post, Israel plans to use its renewed ground offensive to advance the Gaza Strip emigration plan, as Hamas remains “unwilling to compromise” in hostage talks.\n\nPreviously, Breitbart News reported that President Trump’s plan to rebuild Gaza by resettling its inhabitants has significant support among many Gazans and is the “only solution” for struggling civilians, according to the Center for Peace Communications. The center says it is fighting for Gaza Strip residents to be given a chance to leave the war-torn enclave “to find a better life” for themselves and their families “before it’s too late.”\n\nThe growing movement of Gazans speaking out comes as critics and mainstream media label President Trump’s plan unethical, while overlooking the real humanitarian crisis — people who want to leave the territory but remain trapped under Hamas rule.\n\nAccording to a fresh Gallup poll of Gaza’s residents, a majority of Palestinians would leave the coastal enclave if they were able to. The findings revealed that a striking 52% of Gazans expressed a desire to relocate, with 14% saying they would leave permanently and 38% seeking temporary refuge abroad.\n\nFor U.S. interests, a potential outflow from the Gaza Strip could ease military tensions, reduce the influence of Hamas, and shift the regional burden of humanitarian care to wealthier Arab states and Western allies. It may also open new avenues for cooperation with Israel, Egypt, and the Gulf states on long-term stabilization.",

        "title": "Canada’s Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Canada’s conservative leader wants to win the nation’s April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau’s replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians.\n\nThe Conservative Party candidate is Pierre Poilievre. He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party.\n\nThe two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy.\n\nIn 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States.\n\nThat huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians.\n\nIt cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments.\n\nBut the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy.\n\nHowever, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers.\n\nIn the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist:\n\nI will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up.\n\nPoilievre also promised lower migration:\n\nI want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula. The numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people.\n\nThat focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime.\n\nPoilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21.\n\nWiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business:\n\n“We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow.\n\nIn May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying:\n\nLarger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on.\n\nWiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said:\n\nWe look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it.\n\nMayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups.\n\nSince November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration.\n\nMore Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.”\n\nCarney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians:\n\nBut he is being forced to talk about immigration.\n\nOn March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered:\n\nYeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration. [But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor:",

That was something they want to do, and they know where they live isn’t. They’ve seen factories close. So, we need to keep our eyes laser beam focused on how do we expand opportunity.”\n\nNPR Correspondent Barbara Sprunt then said, “She says Democrats haven’t messaged clear enough plans on how to grow the economy.”\n\nSprunt then played a clip where Kaptur said, “I have different mottos I live by, and one of them is, economics is not destiny, but it is 85% of it.

        "content": "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be eliminated.\n\nDuring a Trump administration cabinet meeting at the White House, Noem spoke about how DHS had increased deportations by 50 percent, and praised the United States Coast Guard for doing “phenomenal work” and breaking “historic records in the amount of drug interdictions” they have “brought in.”\n\n“We are, in the month of March — the last couple of weeks, increased our deportations by 50 percent,” Noem said. “So, we’re now not even just getting the worst of the worst out, we’re making sure that there’s consequences for being here and committing crimes in our communities. And, the numbers are continuing to escalate and to go up…….this week I’m headed down to El Salvador. I’ll be in the prison where we sent TdA members, I’ll be meeting with the president and also Columbia and Mexico and talking about building these relations so that we can continue to get people out of this country that don’t belong here and take them home.”\n\nWATCH — FEMA Administrator Reveals 20 Homes “Were Skipped” in Hurricane Aftermath:\n\nNoem added that the U.S. Coast Guard’s fleet had been “repositioned” in order to address the fentanyl crisis and to also “go after the southern border” and to secure it.\n\n“The Coast Guard has done phenomenal work — I don’t know if you all have reported on it, but we have broken historic records in the amount of drug interdictions that they have brought in,” Noem added. “We’ve repositioned the fleet to go after the fentanyl crisis and go after the southern border and securing it, and they’ve done amazing work as far as that.”\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, during an interview on CNN in February, Noem was asked what she would say if President Donald Trump asked her if he should get rid of FEMA. Noem responded by stating that she “would say, yes, get rid of FEMA the way it exists today,” and described FEMA as being a “bureaucracy that’s picking and choosing winners”:\n\nNoem said, “I would say, yes, get rid of FEMA the way it exists today, we still need the resources and the funds and the finances to go to people that have these types of disasters, like Hurricane Helene and the fires in California but you need to let the local officials make the decisions on how that is deployed, so it can be deployed much quicker. And we don’t need this bureaucracy that’s picking and choosing winners.”\n\nIn January, during an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity, Trump criticized FEMA for complicating “everything,” and added that the agency “has not done their job for the last four years.”\n\nTrump added that he would “rather see the states take care of their own problems.”",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "A senior colleague in the Ukrainian President’s Servant of the People Party accused President Donald Trump ally Steve Witkoff of “shameful and shocking statements” and called for his dismissal.\n\nSteve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy who has rapidly become his de facto Moscow envoy as well, as Trump bids to get the participants in the Ukraine war to the negotiating table — and keep them there — has been accused of being an agent for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOleksandr Merezkho, chairman of Ukraine’s foreign affairs committee, who is a Member of Parliament from Zelensky’s Servant of the People Party, reacted with hostility to an interview of Witkoff by Tucker Carlson. During the conversation the businessman-turned-negotiator expressed that in deal making, what’s agreed has to work for all parties, and spoke of the referendums held in Russian-annexed regions without also criticising them, something which Ukraine finds unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Liberty, Zelensky ally Merezkho thundered in response: “Let’s call a spade a spade, these are just shameful, shocking statements… He is relaying Russian propaganda. And I have a question, who is he? Is he a Trump envoy, or maybe he is a Putin envoy?”.\n\nMerezkho questioned whether Witkoff’s comments were informed by “ignorance, naivety, unprofessionalism”, and called on President Trump to “disavow these statements” and to remote Witkoff from the American delegation to the ceasefire talks altogether.\n\nHe said: “Of course, we cannot dictate to our American friends who should represent them, but this person should be removed from this delegation, he should not be the president’s representative. Because he is either completely unprofessional or simply repeats Putin’s narratives”.\n\nThe Trump White House to date has pursued a policy of seeking to enable Ukraine War ceasefire talks and a possible future peace by treating Russia not, as European capitals generally do — as an unmitigated evil to be defeated — but rather as a nation that can be negotiated with. Hearing this articulated in conversation is obviously jarring to European ears, and most of all to Ukraine, which obviously treats any and all Russian claims to U.N.-recognised Ukrainian territory as absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIndeed, Witkoff told Carlson in the interview: “I’m always trying to put myself in the shoes of the other person, because a good deal has to work for everybody.”\n\nAnd indeed, it does appear possible that eventual peace negotiations may involve an exchange of land. Ukraine has tacitly acknowledged that day would come for almost a year with its counter-invasion of Russia, seizing territory in the Kursk Oblast to use as a bargaining chip in future talks. President Trump, amid ongoing talks in Saudi Arabia with the United States in shuttle diplomacy mode between Russia and Ukraine said of negotiations: “I think we’ll be talking about land. There’s a lot of land, it’s a lot different than it was before the war as you know. We’ll be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants because that’s a big question.”",

A contingent of U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement personnel will augment the ship’s crew.\n\nThe Navy announced over the weekend it is deploying the USS Spruance (DDG 111) from San Diego in support of U.S. border security operations off the California coast. “Spruance will be accompanied by an embedded U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET),” Navy officials disclosed.\n\n“USS Spruance’s deployment as part of U.S. Northern Command’s southern border mission brings additional capability and expands the geography of unique military capabilities working with the Department of Homeland Security,” said Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). “With Spruance off the West Coast and USS Gravely in the Gulf of America, our maritime presence contributes to the all-domain, coordinated DOD response to the Presidential Executive Order and demonstrates our resolve to achieve operational control of the border.”\n\nThe destroyer returned in December from a five-month deployment to the Middle East in support of the 5th and 7th fleets and the USS Abraham Carrier Lincoln Strike Group.\n\n“Spruance brings maritime capabilities to USNORTHCOM AOR in response to Presidential executive orders and a national emergency declaration and clarification of the military’s role in protecting the territorial integrity of the United States,” USNORTHCOM officials reported.\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of 1,500 active-duty military personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border, Breitbart Texas reported from Washington, D.C. On January 20, Breitbart reported that President Donald Trump signed an executive order, “Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States.” It was one of ten executive orders relating to border security and illegal immigration signed on Monday by the newly sworn commander-in-chief.\n\nA few days later, a contingency of U.S. Marines landed along the border in Southern California as part of the president’s deployment order.",

I mean, when we think about Social Security, we’re talking about baseline values, our responsibility to our to our elderly, to the folk who have made us possible. what’s motivating this?”\n\nHe continued, “We’re in a new Gilded Age where the fat cats can behave and respond in that way and it’s so mean spirited that we need to ask ourselves, what are we consenting to when they attack something like the Social Security?”\n\nGlaude added, “The thing is that the insolvency question has nothing, they don’t want to get taxed. That’s all you need to do to make social security solvent, is to tax me for the entire 12 months of my working life.”\n\nHe concluded, “But only they don’t want to do that because they’re selfish, they’re greedy. They only care about them. They only care about themselves and their immediate tribe. What are the values that animate this place?

This is what he does,” Hegseth added.\n\nHe also commended the troops who conducted the raids, and the president for ordering strikes against them.\n\n“I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign, because of the skill and courage of our troops. I’ve monitored it very closely from the beginning … Our troops, our sailors, were getting shot at as targets. Our ships couldn’t sail through, and when they did, shoot back purely defensively, or at shacks in Yemen, President Trump said, ‘No more. We will re establish deterrence, we will open freedom of navigation, and we will ultimately decimate the Houthis,’ which is exactly what we’re doing.”\n\nGoldberg infamously wrote a story claiming that Trump had called American troops who died in World War II “suckers and losers.”\n\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X”, Truth Social, or on Facebook.",

        "content": "New York — Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes - not for communicating with anyone - as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.\n\nIn a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.\n\nDefense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \"no connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\"\n\nMangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.\n\nMangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.\n\nThompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.\n\nBut at the same time, the case channeled some Americans' frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.\n\nSome people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.\n\nThrough his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.\n\nIf he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.\n\nOtherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

The three were immediate family members, troopers spokesperson Austin McDaniel said by email.\n\nThe troopers confirmed to Alaska station KTUU-TV Monday that the two young passengers were of elementary and middle school ages.\n\nTroopers previously said they received a report late Sunday that a Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser was overdue. It listed suspected locations as Tustumena Lake and the Kenai Mountains, east of Homer. The 60,000-acre lake has been described by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as \"notorious for its sudden dangerous winds.\"\n\nHomer is a Kenai Peninsula community about 220 miles southwest of Anchorage.\n\nTustumena Lake in Alaska.

After Holmes posted a call for help on Facebook, he said, his daughter told him there were 420 shares on his post. \"I'm proud of the guys that stepped up and went out and helped out,\" Holmes said.\n\nOne of the local pilots who pitched in, Dale Eicher, told KTUU he has a background in performing search and rescue. He said he'd barely started looking when he heard over the radio that someone had found the plane and the three people — then spotted three people walking on the ice.\n\nDennis Hogenson, of the National Transportation Safety Board, called the situation \"remarkable and good news.\"",

Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.\n\n\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"\n\nOn Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans. Accounts appearing to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.\n\nBoth Gabbard and Ratcliffe are testifying to the committee along with FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse.\n\n(L-R): FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe prepare to testify before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, on March 25, 2025.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening remarks.\n\nThe intelligence officials are also set to testify Wednesday to the House Intelligence Committee. The hearings coincide with the release of an annual threat assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThe 2024 report said the U.S. faced \"an increasingly fragile global order\" over the next year that would be strained by great power competition, regional conflicts and transnational challenges.\n\nAt last year's Senate hearing on global threats, the Biden administration's top intelligence officials stressed that U.S. assistance to Ukraine was necessary for its survival against Russia's invasion and that U.S. support for Ukraine also sent a message of deterrence to China as it eyes invading Taiwan.\n\nMr. Trump, who campaigned on ending the war in Ukraine, has taken a friendlier tone toward Russia and temporarily paused intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine after an Oval Office spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nHe recently declined to comment on whether the U.S. would prevent China from taking Taiwan by force while he's president.\n\nMr. Trump is also putting pressure on Iran to negotiate a new nuclear deal, warning that there could be potential military action otherwise.",

        "content": "The Trump administration invoked a state secrets privilege Monday and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under war authorities.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process. It's a case that has become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and the federal courts.\n\nBoasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"\n\nGovernment attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.\n\nCircuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis detained in the U.S. during World World II received better legal treatment than Venezuelan immigrants who were were deported to El Salvador this month under the same statute.\n\n\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMillett is one of three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.\n\nA second judge appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.\n\nThe administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.\n\nAlso on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.\n\nEnsign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"\n\n\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said MiIlett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nJudge Justin Walker, whom Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.\n\n\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\n\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.\n\nWalker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.\n\nGelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.\n\n\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.\n\nBoasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"\n\n\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\" the judge wrote.\n\nTrump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"\n\nJust after midnight Monday, Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.\n\nDuring a hearing Friday, Boasberg vowed to determine whether the government defied his oral order from the bench to turn planes around. The Justice Department has said that the judge's oral directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",

        "content": "Washington — A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.\n\nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.\n\nSen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.\n\n\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"\n\n\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.\n\nIn a piece published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.\n\nThe Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.\n\nThe National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"\n\n\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"\n\nHegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"\n\nAsked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"\n\nHe added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"\n\n\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"\n\nRep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.\n\nRepublican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.\n\n\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.\n\n\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"\n\n\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.\n\nJohnson added that he didn't think Waltz, who apparently started the group chat and included the journalist, according to Goldberg's report, should be disciplined.\n\n, , , and contributed to this report.",

        "content": "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.\n\nDeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.\n\nDeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.\n\nLouis DeJoy, Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Postal Service speaks during the unveiling of a new postage stamp honoring Betty Ford in the East Room of the White House on March 06, 2024 in Washington, DC. tasos katopodis / Getty Images\n\n\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\" DeJoy said in a statement.\n\nHe added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"\n\nThe National Association of Letter Carriers' president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.\n\n\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.\n\nEarlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.\n\nUSPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.\n\nCritics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.\n\nDeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated — including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices — to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging. The USPS targeted a turn to profit in fiscal 2024 but instead reported two consecutive years of increasing losses.\n\nUSPS employs about 640,000 workers who make deliveries from inner cities to rural areas and far-flung islands.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — An appeals court judge said Monday that Nazis were treated better under the Alien Enemies Act than Venezuelan migrants removed from the U.S. and flown to El Salvador earlier this month.\n\n\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" Judge Patricia Millett said, admonishing the Justice Department during oral arguments.\n\n\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" said Drew Ensign, the government's attorney\n\nMillett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison did not have the chance to appear in court.\n\nThe judge said the question at hand wasn't the use of the act, but rather, the right of detainees to have due process and challenge their status as accused members of the gang.\n\nMillett, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said migrants may continue to be detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but they may not be deported until there is a decision on a preliminary injunction to stop the removals.\n\n\"No president has ever used this statute this way,\" Millett said. The Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times — during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. It has never been used when the U.S. was not at war. She raised concerns about the act's implementation by government employees who may have removed people to El Salvador who were not Tren de Aragua members.\n\nJudge Justin Walker asked Ensign whether individual hearings were required before deportations, as D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg had written in his order Monday.\n\nEnsign responded, \"I agree with part of that.\" Walker, a Trump nominee, pressed him on how that would work.\n\n\"There are some individualized Habeas hearings being heard in Texas,\" Walker said. He asked, \"If they can bring a habeas petition and say they're not a member of [Tren de Aragua] … how would they bring that habeas claim?\"\n\nMillett, too, asked Ensign about the men who were deported to El Salvador as gang members: \"Were people on planes last weekend given the ability to file habeas?\"\n\nThe government responded that yes, the five plaintiffs were able to appear in court. But the plaintiffs were not on the deportation flights that are at the center of the case, and they remain in custody in Texas.\n\nEnsign said he did not know how many migrants are being held in the U.S. under the AEA and said those who are currently held are being detained under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ensign argued habeas petitions to appeal detention could be filed on behalf of this class in Texas.\n\n\"When were they given notice that they were being detained as part of [Tren de Aragua]\" and how much notice was given before they were put on the plane, Millett asked.\n\nEnsign said the answers were not in the record. He told the appeals panel, \"We've agreed challenges to individual determinations can be brought.\"\n\nBut Millett pressed him further, asking whether \"the government considers itself within its right to pack every member of this class on an airplane before there is a reasonable amount of time to file a habeas petition?\" Ensign did not respond immediately, but later said the statute does not require such notice — notice, that is, that they were being detained as Tren de Aragua members.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorney Lee Gelernt of the ACLU claimed, \"There was no process,\" and migrants \"were designated [Tren de Aragua] without any advance notice and rushed onto planes.\" He said he would soon submit declarations reflecting this.\n\nThe government also made the case before the appeals panel that it should be moved to another venue and that the president's decision to invoke the AEA was not reviewable.\n\nEnsign said the lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the act represented an \"enormous intrusion\" into presidential power.\n\nChief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government's motion to rescind his order regarding the administration's use of the AEA for deportations. He found the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of the case because they're entitled to due process and individual hearings.\n\nHe also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump's use of the act for these deportations is lawful, writing, \"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion.'\"\n\nJudge Walker appeared to take the government's side about the venue where the case was brought, pointing out that the complaint, which is being heard in Washington, D.C., could have been filed in Texas, where the five original plaintiffs are in custody.\n\nGelernt conceded the point, but argued \"this has all been done in secret,\" and it would not have enabled hearings to be held on an individual basis for all those accused of being gang members. The government has not released the names of the 238 men deported on two flights to El Salvador who are now being held in a maximum security terrorism prison, although CBS News reported their names last week.\n\n\"Absent a class [temporary restraining order], we would have had far more people sitting in a Salvadoran prison,\" Gelernt said.\n\n\"I think that's a tough precedent for you,\" Walker told Gelernt, because no suit was being brought in Texas, where the defendants were being held.\n\n\"No class member is seeking release\" Gelernt responded. \"The government is using the act to try and short-circuit immigration proceedings.\"\n\n\"We are absolutely not trying to get anybody out of detention.\" Gelernt added.\n\n\"Can you — standing here — give us an example of a district court injunction that enjoined a national security operation that survived appeal?\" Walker asked.\n\n\"The implications of not giving people a chance to contest it are extraordinary,\" Gelernt replied.\n\n\"Many — if not most — of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\" Gelernt said, asking that Judge Boasberg be allowed to continue his work. He predicted the plaintiffs would end up \"on a plane\" following the trajectory of the other alleged Venezeulan gang members if the order blocking the use of the AEA is lifted.",

If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid — health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.\n\nOz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz speaks during a confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on March 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nThe former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.\n\nThe vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.\n\nShould Oz's nomination advance out of committee, his confirmation would move to the Senate floor, where Republicans can afford to lose three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Getty Images\n\nWhile the inflation dropped slightly in February, it has been ticking back up overall over the last few months, and it's changing how smart homebuyers approach their mortgages. If you're in the market for a home this year, you may wonder: Is a 30-year or 15-year mortgage better in this economic environment?\n\nTo help you make a wise choice, we asked mortgage experts to weigh in on both loan types during inflationary periods. Their advice will guide you toward the mortgage loan that best aligns with your financial situation and long-term goals.\n\nFind out how affordable a mortgage loan could be today.\n\n30-year vs. 15-year mortgage loans: Which is better during inflation?\n\nThe best mortgage loan during inflation depends on your job stability and income prospects, experts say.\n\n\"While a 15-year mortgage offers the greatest long-term savings, a 30-year loan [provides more flexibility with] lower monthly payments,\" says Debbie Calixto, sales manager at loanDepot.\n\nBelow, we'll look at when each mortgage term makes financial sense and what long-term impacts you should consider before deciding.\n\nWhen a 30-year mortgage makes sense during inflation\n\n\"When inflation is running high, a 30-year mortgage [gives] you cash flow flexibility,\" says Reed Letson, a mortgage broker and owner of Elevation Mortgage. As inflation rises, your fixed mortgage payment becomes cheaper while your income typically increases.\n\nA 30-year mortgage makes the most sense in the following scenarios:\n\nYour income fluctuates: Lower payments offer security when you have income changes or unexpected expenses. This \"can be especially valuable when the cost of living is rising,\" Calixto says.\n\nLower payments offer security when you have income changes or unexpected expenses. This \"can be especially valuable when the cost of living is rising,\" Calixto says. You want to invest elsewhere: A 30-year term means you spend more time paying interest. However, lower monthly payments mean more liquid cash to invest in other assets that could outpace inflation.\n\nExplore your top mortgage loan options online now.\n\nWhen a 15-year mortgage makes sense during inflation\n\n\"A 15-year mortgage is a better hedge against inflation than a longer-term loan if you can comfortably afford higher monthly payments,\" Calixto says. These higher payments allow you to build equity faster and greatly reduce the total interest paid over the life of your loan.\n\nA 15-year mortgage typically makes the most sense in the following scenarios:\n\nYou have a stable, high income: If you have consistent earnings and prioritize becoming debt-free, Letson suggests the higher payments can be worth the long-term savings.\n\nIf you have consistent earnings and prioritize becoming debt-free, Letson suggests the higher payments can be worth the long-term savings. You're planning for retirement: With more of each payment going toward the principal from the start, you'll own your home outright sooner. Paying off your home before retirement provides more security when your income drops.\n\nLong-term financial impacts to consider when comparing mortgage terms\n\nBefore committing to a 15-year or 30-year mortgage loan, industry professionals recommend considering these factors:\n\nFuture financial flexibility: A 30-year mortgage's lower payments provide a nice buffer for unforeseen financial changes. \"If you end up with extra cash flow, you can still speed up your repayment by making additional payments toward the principal,\" says Calixto.\n\nA 30-year mortgage's lower payments provide a nice buffer for unforeseen financial changes. \"If you end up with extra cash flow, you can still speed up your repayment by making additional payments toward the principal,\" says Calixto.

Refinancing options: \"The downside to inflation is higher rates,\" says Dean Rathbun, executive vice president at United American Mortgage Corporation. But a 15-year mortgage will pay down the principal faster. When mortgage interest rates\n\n\"The downside to inflation is higher rates,\" says Dean Rathbun, executive vice president at United American Mortgage Corporation. But a 15-year mortgage will pay down the principal faster. When Rate differentials: \"Make sure the rate on a 15-year mortgage is at least 0.375% lower than a 30-year mortgage,\" advises Rathbun. Otherwise, a 30-year loan with extra payments might be better.\n\nHow to find the best mortgage lender in today's economy\n\nFinding the right mortgage lender is as important as choosing between a 15-year and 30-year loan. \"A knowledgable [one] will take the time to understand your needs, priorities and preferences,\" Calixto says.\n\nHere are practical tips for finding the best mortgage lender during inflation:\n\nGather quotes from at least three lenders: \"Compare their rates and fees,\" says Rathbun. \"Some lenders work on lower margins, which allow [you] to [secure] a lower interest rate.\"\n\n\"Compare their rates and fees,\" says Rathbun. \"Some lenders work on lower margins, which allow [you] to [secure] a lower interest rate.\" Look beyond the interest rate: The lowest rate isn't always the best deal.

No injuries were reported, but Mr. Trump called those behind the alleged attack \"terrorists.\"\n\nLast week, Attorney General Pam Bondi described attacks on Teslas as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" in a statement. She vowed to \"impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\"\n\nThe FBI has created a task force to investigate the Tesla incidents, according to an FBI official, and the DHS memo, published on March 21, said that the FBI and DHS are now working with federal, state and local law enforcement \"to disrupt and deter future incidents.\n\n\"Has there ever been such a level of coordinated violence against a peaceful company?\" Elon Musk posted on X on March 20. \"I understand not wanting to buy a product, but this is extreme arson and destruction!\"\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts assess that in the next year, \"incidents targeting Tesla EVs and dealerships potentially pose an increased risk of injuries to civilians and first responders.\" DHS and FBI assess that individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms.

        "content": "Paris — French cinema icon Gérard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.\n\nTaking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.\n\n\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"\n\nThe actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.\n\nThe two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.\n\nThe trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.\n\nFrench actor Gérard Depardieu (left) walks with his lawyer Jeremie Assous as he arrives for the opening of his trial in which he is accused of sexually assaulting two women during a film shoot in 2021, at the Paris criminal court in the Tribunal de Paris courthouse, March 24, 2025. DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP/Getty\n\nMedical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.\n\nDepardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.\n\n\"Gérard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer Jérémie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"\n\nDozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".\n\nA giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.\n\nIn a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.\n\nDepardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.\n\nHe later also became a citizen of Dubai.\n\nDepardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Here's how aviation safety, roads and more scored in the latest U.S. infrastructure report card\n\nA once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.\n\n\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure — from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries — hurts people and the economy.\n\n\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.\n\nThe report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.\n\nEight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years\n\nOlson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.\n\nThe 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.\n\nPresident Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.\n\nMassive spending needed\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.\n\nEven if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.\n\nThe bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.\n\nMany communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.\n\nThe infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"\n\nThe bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.\n\nBarges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams — many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair — is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.\n\nAnd when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.\n\n\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.\n\nThe report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.\n\n\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City — charging people to drive in crowded areas — places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.\n\nRoads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.\n\nAviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.\n\nTwo categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.\n\nThe energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.\n\nInvest now or pay more later\n\nEngineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.\n\nOn Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.\n\n\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said.",

        "content": "The sister of Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. John Chapman, an elite combat controller who died on a mountainside during the Battle of Takur Ghar in Afghanistan, is angered by the way the new National Medal of Honor Museum is handling her brother's story.\n\nThe museum in Arlington, Texas, which pays tribute to more than 3,500 U.S. service members who have earned America's highest military honor, opens to the public on Tuesday. But a disparity in the way the museum treated the story of two recipients has reignited a controversy.\n\nChapman's sister, Lori Longfritz, told \"CBS Mornings\" she believed her brother would get his own dedicated space at the museum for his heroic acts on March 4, 2002.\n\nReigniting a controversy\n\nChapman earned a posthumous Medal of Honor in 2018, becoming the first member of the Air Force to receive the award since the Vietnam War — and the first recipient where drone video provided evidence of his heroic actions.\n\nIn one of the most intense battles of the war in Afghanistan, Chapman was working with a team of Navy SEALs who stepped off a helicopter onto the Takur Ghar mountain and into the path of enemy fire.\n\n\"Without regard for his own safety, Sergeant Chapman immediately engaged, moving in the direction of the closest enemy position despite coming under heavy fire from multiple directions. He fearlessly charged an enemy bunker, up a steep incline in thigh-deep snow and into hostile fire, directly engaging the enemy,\" his Medal of Honor citation reads.\n\nAfter clearing the first bunker, killing all enemy occupants, Chapman started attacking a second bunker before being shot and seriously wounded, according to the citation.\n\nThe SEAL team leader at the time, Master Chief Britt Slabinski, told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin in 2018 that he ordered his team to pull back as he \"crawled over the top\" of Chapman to search for \"some sign of life.\"\n\n\"I didn't get any, any sign from him,\" said Britt. Believing he was dead and in a dangerous spot in the middle of the ongoing firefight, Slabinski left Chapman and relocated his team to safer ground.\n\nA military analysis of drone video later showed Chapman had still been alive at that time. He had regained consciousness and carried on fighting alone, providing crucial cover fire as reinforcements tried to land. He was credited with saving more than 20 American service members, including Slabinski.\n\n\"Despite severe, mortal wounds, [Chapman] continued to fight relentlessly, sustaining a violent engagement with multiple enemy personnel before making the ultimate sacrifice,\" the citation says.\n\nYet more than a decade after the battle, as the Pentagon considered him for the Medal of Honor for those actions, some Navy SEALs resisted. Two former defense officials involved in the process claim the SEALs argued against Chapman posthumously receiving the award, with one telling CBS News they \"couldn't accept any hint that SEALs had left behind a service member on the battlefield.\"\n\nIt's a position Slabinski himself maintained even as he received his own Medal of Honor months before Chapman.\n\n\"I can tell you, we left no one behind. No one. What I saw, what I experienced, I know that clearly that we didn't leave anyone behind up there,\" he said in a 2018 interview with Fox News.\n\nIn a statement, a Naval Special Warfare spokesperson told CBS News, \"We honor the valor and heroism of all Medal of Honor recipients with the dignity and respect they deserve.\"\n\nThe statement didn't address accusations about past opposition to Chapman's Medal of Honor, saying only that the SEALs hold him \"in high regard as a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for his teammates. He will forever remain in our memory.\"\n\n\"There was never going to be a John Chapman exhibit\"\n\n\"I do believe that there is such a thing as fog of war,\" Longfritz acknowledged as she spoke about her brother being left behind on the battlefield in an interview from the town of Windsor Locks, Connecticut, where they grew up.\n\nRegarding Slabinski and the SEALs, she said, \"I can't judge them for what they did on the mountain, what happened. I can judge them for how they've acted since then.\"\n\nChapman's photo hangs on a wall near a monitor playing the drone footage at the new museum — part of a larger exhibit on the timeline of the Medal of Honor, while Slabinski is among several service members who have their own featured exhibits. Slabinski's section is filled with multiple photos and artifacts — like his field knife, ID tag, combat trousers and dress white uniform.\n\nLongfritz said representatives at the National Medal of Honor Museum led her to believe that Chapman would also be getting his own featured exhibit. However, in a lengthy statement to CBS News, the museum stated that \"it is not possible to tell 3,526 stories in a museum's exhibits at one time.\"\n\n\"There was never going to be a John Chapman exhibit,\" according to a former museum employee, who told CBS News the plan was to \"kick this can down the road,\" knowing the underlying tensions between the two sides.\n\nThe museum says Chapman's story is still among the most high-profile mentioned in the museum.\n\n\"When evaluating individual coverage of recipients included in the exhibits by word count, Master Sergeant Chapman is among the top 25 percent,\" the museum added in their statement.\n\nBut \"word count\" is not the right measure for Longfritz.\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" said Longfritz. \"I had found a way to just let it go, and then this. I didn't want this, but I'm not going anywhere now.\"\n\nA growing petition\n\nMany in the Air Force community see this as a problem as well. More than 25,000 people have signed an online petition demanding Chapman be given a full exhibit in the museum.\n\nIt's also drawn the ire of Florida Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, an Air Force veteran.\n\n\"It's a blatant disrespect for someone who lost their life, serving this country and that wrong needs to be corrected immediately,\" said Luna, who supports Chapman getting his own exhibit.\n\nWhen asked what she believes is behind the decision, she answered that \"politics played a hand in this entire Medal of Honor debacle,\" and pointed out that Slabinski serves on the museum's board of directors.\n\nCBS News attempted to reach Slabinski, whose wife also works at the museum, several times but never heard back.\n\nIf the museum doesn't fix the disparity, Luna said she would \"call to question\" anyone supporting the museum \"to reconsider giving funds to an organization that would play politics with people that have sacrificed their lives for this country.\"\n\nAccording to the museum, \"No preference was given to board member Medal of Honor recipients and, to their great credit, it was the board member recipients who specifically asked to be treated no differently in exhibit consideration than their peers.\"\n\nBut if the roles were reversed, Longfritz believes her brother \"would be the first one to say, 'Do not honor me. This guy who died saving my life deserves it more than I do.'\"\n\n\"I feel like if someone is a true hero…they don't want it for themselves,\" she added.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain some artificial dyes or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.\n\nOn Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes — Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 — from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.\n\nThe dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.\n\n\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"\n\nThe latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.\n\nThirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.\n\nRising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The U.S. and Russia were expected to release a joint statement early Tuesday morning after discussions in Saudi Arabia aimed at achieving a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The statement was expected to come out at 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., which is 11 a.m. in Moscow, two of the sources said, but that time came and went without any word from American officials.\n\nWhile the details of the expected statement were not clear, reports shared with the Trump administration from the U.S. technical team in Riyadh seemed optimistic, the sources had said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters more than an hour after the statement had been expected, however, that Russian officials were still analyzing the information relayed back to Moscow by the Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The content of the technical negotiations will definitely not be 'published.' This should not be expected,\" he said, characterizing the talks as \"negotiations with a deep dive into details.\"\n\n\"The reports made in the capital [by Russia's negotiators to the government] are being analyzed, and only then will it be possible to talk about some understandings,\" Peskov told reporters, adding that the dialogue between Russian and American officials would continue.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by Russia's state-run TASS news agency later Tuesday as saying Moscow would consider a new version of a previous Black Sea ceasefire deal with Ukraine, which was crafted to enable the safe shipment of grain products from Ukraine and Russia, but only with \"clear guarantees\" that he said could \"only be the result of an order from Washington\" to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nRussian negotiator Grigory Karasin, in Riyadh, was cited earlier by TASS as saying Moscow would continue the \"useful\" talks with the U.S., and would seek to involve the U.N. and other nations.\n\n\"We talked about everything, it was an intense dialogue, not easy, but very useful for us and the Americans,\" Karasin said, according to TASS, adding that \"lots of problems were discussed\" during 12 hours of negotiations in a luxury hotel in Riyadh.\n\nUkrainian officials were also briefed on the content of the U.S.-Russia talks, one of the sources told CBS News. French news agency AFP cited a Ukrainian source as saying Ukrainian and U.S. officials held another round of talks in Riyadh on Tuesday.\n\n\"The talks are over. All details will be announced later,\" the source told a small group of media, including AFP.\n\nThe previous deal, called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey. Russia exited that agreement in 2023, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine's other international partners had not allowed Moscow to export some agricultural products in violation of the terms. Lavrov's remarks on Tuesday appeared to confirm that a new version of that limited agreement was being discussed, at least between the Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe State Department's Michael Anton and the White House National Security Council's Andrew Peek are among the U.S. officials who have been meeting with the Russian negotiators in Riyadh.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe details of the agreement reached during that phone call have never been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching. Mr. Trump said Putin agreed during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Ukraine accused Russia within hours of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.\n\nNext on the agenda, Waltz said Sunday, was a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods.\n\n\"And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace,\" Waltz said.\n\nWhile the talks have been ongoing between U.S. and Russian and, separately, U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the two warring countries continue to launch attacks at each other.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "title": "Who is Frank Bisignano, Trump's nominee to oversee Social Security?",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "During his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, Frank Bisignano, President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), is likely to face a barrage of questions about where he stands on the future of a government agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.\n\nLike other federal agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.\n\nIn February, the SSA announced it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers.\n\nWho is Frank Bisignano?\n\nEven before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump announced the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"\n\nBisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.\n\nPreviously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he had been chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"\n\nPrior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.\n\nWhat are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?\n\nIn a March 23 letter to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden — both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination — expressed concern about the ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.\n\n\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts — in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump promised not to touch the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to roughly 1 in 5 Americans.\n\nWarren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.\n\n\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv — which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' — could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"\n\nBy contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March statement that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"\n\nWhat do advocates for seniors have to say?\n\nSome advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.\n\n\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"\n\nAfter Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.\n\n\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "In its juicy heyday, a glass of orange juice was a staple of a healthy breakfast. Orange crops flourished in Florida — the \"Orange State.\"\n\nShannon Shepp, executive director of the state's Department of Citrus, agrees those were the \"good old days,\" but she also knows nostalgia is no nutrient to grow a sunny future. While some industries have supply issues and some have demand issues, oranges have both.\n\nRight now, supply is the greater challenge, Shepp said, due to a \"terminal disease\" that's been affecting citrus trees for two decades. Citrus greening is a bacterial infection spread by an Asian bug. It has blighted the state's orange industry, and although research is ongoing, there's no cure.\n\nOver the last 20 years, production in Florida orange groves has plummeted 92%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Demand for orange juice hit an all-time low last year, and this year is projected to be no better.\n\nOver the years, consumer tastes changed. Concerns about sugar content have far fewer Americans drinking orange juice. At the industry's peak in the late 1990s, Florida produced 240 million boxes of oranges, according to the USDA.\n\nLast year, just 17 million boxes were produced, Shepp said.\n\n\"It's a huge drop. We hold our breath on every crop forecast,\" she added.\n\nThis year's crop looked promising for farmers like Christian Spinosa, whose family's fifth-generation farm spans 800 acres. But last October, Hurricane Milton killed 40% of his Valencia oranges.\n\nAnd now, there's a new threat: tariffs targeting Canada, the major importer of Florida oranges.\n\n\"Really it's our position that anybody who wants orange juice, we want them to have it,\" Shepp said.\n\nStill, a defiant Spinsoa is fighting to make sure his family farm has a sixth generation to run it.\n\n\"Without a doubt, we can have America drinking orange juice. I don't envision a day where orange juice for breakfast is not a normal thing in America,\" Spinosa said.",

        "content": "The Trump administration is seeking to arrest and deport a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been looking for Yunseo Chung, who came to the U.S. with her family from South Korea at the age of 7, since earlier this month, including by visiting her parents' residence and telling her lawyer that there's an administrative warrant for her arrest, according to the lawsuit.\n\nICE issues so-called administrative warrants against noncitizens accused of immigration violations. They are not signed by judges.\n\nThe lawsuit says the actions by ICE and other officials started \"mere days\" after Chung was arrested and given an \"obstruction of governmental administration\" citation by the New York Police Department during a March 5 protest over Columbia University taking disciplinary actions against certain students who had been involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nHer lawyers argue the administration is targeting Chung because of her political speech, citing the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE earlier this month and who the government is trying to deport.\n\n\"Now, officials at the highest echelons of government are attempting to use immigration enforcement as a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike, including Ms. Chung's speech,\" the lawsuit says.\n\n\"The case challenges the Trump administration's alarming new policy of using immigration law to target noncitizens who engage in protest or advocacy in support of Palestinian rights, part of a series of authoritarian actions through which the administration seeks to silence political viewpoints it opposes,\" the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, which filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"Speech concerning political change receives the highest level of protection under the First Amendment, which the Supreme Court for nearly a century has interpreted to protect noncitizens.\"\n\nICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment.\n\nChung's lawyers believe the government is trying to revoke their client's green card and eventually deport her through the same rarely used immigration law that officials have invoked to justify Khalil's detention — although the Justice Department has also since accused Khalil of immigration fraud. That law allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S.\n\nChung's attorneys called the idea that her speech in support of Palestinians could jeopardize U.S. foreign policy \"a preposterous proposition.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the federal court in Manhattan to block ICE from arresting Chung under that law and to declare that the Trump administration is unlawfully targeting pro-Palestinian activists because of their political speech, in violation of the First Amendment.",

        "content": "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, is facing a Senate hearing on Tuesday morning about his qualifications to run the massive retirement system, as well as his plans for the agency at a time when it has been targeted for significant job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.\n\nHere's what to know about the hearing.\n\nHow to watch the Social Security hearing\n\nThe Senate hearing will be streamed at 10:10 a.m. ET at the Senate Finance Committee's website, which can be found here.\n\nWho is Frank Bisignano?\n\nBisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.\n\nPrior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.\n\nWhat has Bisignano said about Social Security?\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.\n\n\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"\n\nThe executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to find fraud, waste or abuse within the system.\n\nMr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.\n\nThe program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nInflation isn't the only factor at play, but it has a big impact on where mortgage rates head. Yevhenii Kazykin/Getty Images\n\nAfter four straight months of increases, the inflation rate fell slightly in February, dropping to 2.8% from 3.0% the month prior. But despite those recent upticks, today's inflation rate is a big improvement compared to 2022, when inflation surpassed 9%. Still, it's hardly a surprise that inflation has been a key topic of conversation over the past several years. And while Americans are keeping an eye on inflation for many reasons, one particular reason is the effect it has on mortgage rates.\n\nMortgage rates have remained elevated over the past couple of years, reaching their peak in late 2023, largely as a result of the Federal Reserve's response to inflation. However, since inflation has been trending downward overall over the past few years, and just fell month-over-month in February, many current and prospective homeowners now wonder when inflation will be low enough for mortgage rates to drop again.\n\nIf you've been waiting for inflation to drop and push down mortgage rates, here's what experts have to say on the topic.\n\nCompare today's mortgage loan options and lock in a top rate now.\n\nWhen will inflation be low enough for mortgage rates to drop?\n\nWhile inflation doesn't directly cause mortgage rates to rise, there is a correlation between the two. You'll often see that as inflation rises, mortgage rates tend to follow suit.\n\nOne reason for this trend is Federal Reserve policy. The Fed responds to high inflation by raising the federal funds rate, which trickles down to other rates — including mortgage rates. On the other hand, when inflation and economic growth slows, the Fed lowers rates, which can bring mortgage rates down with it.\n\n\"Inflation is a key factor when the Fed is deciding their course of action for the fed funds rate,\" says Sarah DeFlorio, vice president of mortgage banking at William Raveis Mortgage. \"While the Fed funds rate does not immediately impact mortgage rates, the overall sentiment of the market as it digests economic data has the ability to help swing rates in either direction.\n\nDeFlorio notes that factors other than the federal funds affect mortgage rates. However, a general rule is that as inflation falls (meaning as economic growth slows), interest rates fall.\n\n\"The most direct correlation for mortgage rates is with the 10-year treasury bond yields — and as a rule of thumb, bad news for the economy is good news for mortgage rates. So, while a recession could spell very difficult times for many people, it would also push rates down,\" DeFlorio says.\n\nThe original expectation among experts was that inflation would continue to fall throughout 2025, bringing mortgage rates down with it. However, the rise in inflation in late 2024 and early 2025, and the increased economic uncertainty that started early this year, have raised some questions.\n\nAt the Fed's most recent meeting, it declined to lower the federal funds rate. Meanwhile, many financial experts believe the Fed will hold rates steady for at least the early part of 2025, possibly considering rate cuts later in the year depending on how inflation plays out. If the Fed cuts interest rates, it's likely mortgage rates would fall as well. The Fed generally aims for an inflation rate of 2%. If we get to that point, a rate cut would be more likely.\n\n\"While the target is 2% for the inflation rate, it is important to keep in mind that the Fed will also be looking for consistency of the data over a longer period of time in order to feel confident that they have been successful in their mission of maintaining economic stability,\" says DeFlorio.\n\nFind out how affordable the right mortgage loan could be today.\n\nWhat experts say could happen with mortgage rates\n\nIt's impossible to know for certain what will happen to mortgage rates in 2025. On the one hand, if inflation continues to fall, as it was expected to in 2025, and the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, it's likely we'll see a rate cut. On the other hand, if inflation rises again, we could see rates stagnate — or, in the worst-case scenario, increase again.\n\nThe general belief among industry experts is that mortgage rates will fall slightly later in 2025, but that they won't fall as much as initially predicted. That means mortgage rates are still likely to remain well above pre-pandemic levels for now.\n\n\"Rates will likely trend down. We have had an incredibly resilient economy and job market, yet the current instability is creating more uncertainty and talks of a recession,\" Nicole Rueth, the founder of The Rueth Team Mortgage at Movement Mortgage. \"If that is the case, we could see mortgage rates as low as 6% by the 3rd quarter. Of course, there is much that still depends on economic data and Fed moves.\"\n\nOf course, inflation and the federal funds rate aren't the only factors that impact mortgage rates.\n\nFor example, 10-year Treasury otes are closely correlated with mortgage rates, given their similarly long time horizons. A variety of factors can affect 10-year Treasury rates, including both monetary and fiscal policy, economic growth and inflation. Any changes in mortgage rates that occur throughout 2025 will likely be the result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThe benefits of locking in a mortgage rate now\n\nHigh mortgage rates have left plenty of prospective homebuyers sitting on the sidelines, hoping loans will become more affordable. But the general consensus among the experts we talked to is that it isn't the right strategy for most people.\n\n\"Inventory is the biggest challenge for homebuyers across the U.S. Inventory levels are extremely low, and buyer demand is still high,\" says Jeremy Schachter, branch manager at Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation. \"As rates slowly come down, more buyers will be in the market, which will increase competition.\"\n\nAccording to Schachter, it's impossible to time the housing market. In all likelihood, you'll be entering the market at the same time as all the other buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines.\n\n\"Home values are also increasing,\" says Schachter. \"If you are looking at that $500,000 home but holding off due to interest rates, when rates come down, that same home more than likely will be higher. The wait in buying to get a lower rate may cancel out the increased value of that home in your mortgage payment.\"\n\nSchachter recommends that if the perfect house comes along and you can afford the monthly payment, buy it — and if the opportunity arises, you can refinance at a lower rate later on. Buying now, before rates decline, can help you get ahead of the competition, giving you the best shot and buying the right house at the right price.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you've been in the market for a home, then you've likely been keeping a close eye on inflation and mortgage rates, hoping to see them come down. While there's some uncertainty in the rate market today, experts still believe mortgage rates will fall slightly in 2025, though maybe not as much as they previously thought.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you should wait until rates fall to buy a house. If the perfect house comes on the market and you can afford it, it may be worth taking the leap at a higher mortgage rate and refinancing later.",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nBoth HELOCs and cash-out refinance loans provide homeowners access to their accumulated home equity. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe decision to borrow from your accumulated home equity is dependent on multiple factors, not least of which is the borrowing environment. For instance, a cash-out refinance loan, in which homeowners take out a new mortgage loan for an amount larger than their current mortgage balance (and then keep the difference between the two as cash), can be the smart way to access funding in a low-rate climate since you'll need to reconfigure your mortgage terms.\n\nIn the interest rate climate of recent years, however, plagued by inflation and a high federal funds rate, borrowing equity via a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) was often the cost-effective way to access a large amount of equity. With rates on credit cards and personal loans in the double digits, and mortgage rates almost double what they were a few years ago, HELOCs and home equity loans have become preferential borrowing options for many. And that's especially true now when comparing a HELOC to a cash-out refinance.\n\nWhile some homeowners could still find a cash-out refinance to be their optimal home equity borrowing option, many others may be better off with a HELOC now. Below, we'll explain why.\n\nStart by checking your HELOC eligibility requirements here.\n\nWhy a HELOC could be better than a cash-out refinance now\n\nHere are three big reasons why a HELOC could be better than applying for a cash-out refinance now:\n\nHELOC rates have been continually declining\n\nIt's always a positive when the interest rate on your borrowing product has been declining — and for HELOCs, that's been the case now for over a full year. Starting around 10% in early 2024, the average HELOC interest rate is poised to break below the 8% mark any day now. That came after average rates declined for much of 2024 and continued to do so in 2025, hitting 18-month and multiple two-year lows already.\n\nThis not only makes a HELOC cheaper than a home equity loan (at 8.37% on average) but also substantially less expensive than personal loans (around 12%) and credit cards (over 20%) now. And with the likelihood that HELOC rates will continue to decline in the weeks and months to come, borrowing with a line of credit could be particularly advantageous if applied for now.\n\nGet started with a HELOC online today.\n\nHELOCs won't require you to restructure your mortgage terms\n\nIn the interest rate climate of March 2020, when mortgage and mortgage refinance rates hovered near record lows, restructuring your mortgage terms to secure a cash-out refinance not only would not have been problematic, but depending on your mortgage rate, it may have even been an advantage.\n\nHowever, the interest rate climate of March 2025 is much different. The average refinance rate for a 30-year mortgage loan is now 6.70%, meaning that many homeowners would have to take on a new, higher mortgage rate to secure their cash-out refinance. A HELOC, however, will leave your original mortgage terms untouched, giving you access to a healthy revolving line of credit without having to worry about a new, potentially unaffordable monthly mortgage payment.\n\nHELOCs come with tax benefits\n\nWith April 15 looming for millions of taxpayers, you may find yourself looking for ways to reduce your tax bill for the future. A cash-out refinance can't help since you'll simply be reworking your existing mortgage term (although the traditional mortgage interest deductions may still be in play). Interest paid on a HELOC, however, can be tax-deductible if the line of credit is used for qualifying home repairs and renovations.\n\nThis will not only put more money in your pocket when you file your 2025 return (and all returns for the years in which you used the HELOC), but it will also make concerns over HELOC interest rates less prominent when knowing that the interest paid will add up in a deduction at the end of the year. Still, mortgage interest deductions can also be significant so it's worth speaking to a financial advisor or accountant who can better help you determine which option's tax benefits are more applicable to you.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWith a continually declining interest rate, a structure that won't require you to redo your current mortgage terms and tax benefits that could add up to a significant return when you file your next tax return, a HELOC could be better than a cash-out refinance for many homeowners now. Still, both options require you to work with your home as a funding source, so it's smart to be careful in your process and it could be valuable to crunch your repayment figures on both to more accurately determine what's most affordable and beneficial now and, over time.\n\nLearn more about your current HELOC options here.",

        "content": "Israel launched a strike on Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets on Israeli targets, killing six people in the heaviest exchange of fire since its ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah began nearly four months ago.\n\nThe exchange sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold, days after Israel relaunched its war with another Iran-backed militant group, Hamas, in Gaza. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the attack, saying it was committed to the truce.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. Israel's army said six rockets were fired toward Metula, a town along the border with Lebanon. Three crossed into Israel and were intercepted.\n\nThe army said it \"cannot confirm the identity of the organization that fired the rockets.\" It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.\n\nAn Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese village of Touline killed five people, including a child, and wounded 10 others, including two children, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.\n\nLebanese people inspect the destruction of a building that was targeted in an Israeli air strike in the southern Lebanese village of Touline on March 22, 2025. STR/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nAnother Israeli strike Saturday night hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.\n\nA Hezbollah official told The Associated Press Saturday that it was not responsible for the initial attack, calling it \"primitive,\" speaking on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nIn a statement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.\n\nUnder the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.\n\nBut since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.\n\nThe strikes on Lebanon come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \"with increasing intensity\" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive.\n\nThe attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

He said the hospital was at a standstill and he was worried about the possibility of another attack.\n\nSources told CBS News that Ismail Barhoum, a political Hamas member and spokesperson, was the target of the strike at the hospital.\n\nThe Hamas-led Gaza's Health Ministry said a total of 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. The latest toll announced Sunday includes 673 people killed since Israel's surprise bombardment on Tuesday as well as 233 bodies that were recently identified, the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its records but has said women and children make up more than half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.\n\nLate Saturday, Israel's Cabinet approved a proposal to set up a new directorate tasked with advancing the \"voluntary departure\" of Palestinians in line with President Trump's proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it for others.\n\nPalestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland, and rights groups have said the plan could amount to expulsion in violation of international law.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the new body would be \"subject to Israeli and international law\" and coordinate \"passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.\"\n\nResidents of the Shuja'iyya neighborhood migrate to the center of Gaza City with what they could take with them due to Ithe sraeli army's intensive attacks on the area in Gaza on March 23, 2025.

Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.\n\nThe National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.\n\n\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"\n\nWhen asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"\n\nIn a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.\n\n\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.\n\nThen, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.\n\nThe Atlantic story\n\nIn his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.\n\nGoldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.\n\n\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.\n\nThe Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.\n\nOn March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.\n\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\n\nGoldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns — and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what — nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"\n\nOn Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"\n\n\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.\n\nGoldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.\n\n\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.\n\nHe said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:\n\nA screenshot of the Signal group chat after the strikes on Yemen, as published by The Atlantic. The Atlantic\n\n\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was.\"\n\nAt 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.\n\n\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"\n\nGoldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me — they like convenience. They're just like you and me — they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"\n\nCBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.\n\n\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans — and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.\n\nCongressional reaction\n\nThe story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"\n\nAt the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.\n\n\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"\n\n\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

But with tariffs in play on spirits like Tennessee whiskey, owner Lee Kennedy fears his export sales could soon run dry.\n\n\"We haven't adjusted any of our prices over the last, really, uh, since 2020, we have not done any price increases or decreases, and I'm hoping to be able to continue that,\" Kennedy told CBS News.\n\nThe European Union, in response to tariffs from the Trump administration, announced in March it plans to put a 50% tariff on all American whiskey, despite whiskey exports jumping nearly 60% in the last three years, according to Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.\n\nAcross the northern border, Canadian retailers are pulling American liquor off the shelves.\n\n\"A lot of that whiskey that was destined for international markets is now gonna stay in the country,\" Kennedy said. \"So we have this kind of trifecta of not good scenarios for the distilling industry. You know, the threat of tariffs, the decrease in consumption and the oversupply... those three things.\"\n\nIn Dallas, bar owner Gabe Sanchez fears tequila could be nearly impossible to get, as his entire supply comes from Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported more than $5 billion worth of tequila from Mexico, according to Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Sanchez expects prices from distributors to skyrocket to make up for the 25% tariff President Trump has threatened to impose on all goods from Mexico. That increase would force Sanchez to either raise his own prices and risk losing customers, or eat the cost himself.\n\n\"Places like this are gonna cease to exist. If these trade wars continue, that's like, unfortunately, what's gonna happen. Like, we can only stand in front of the dam and put our finger in it for so long,\" Sanchez said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nThe latest inflation data could have an impact on where mortgage rates are headed next. Getty Images\n\nWednesday's inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that inflation decreased in February to 2.8% from 3.0% the month prior. This shift in inflation broke a four-month streak of inflation increases, offering some hope that better days are ahead in terms of the inflationary environment.\n\nWhat does Wednesday's news mean for mortgage rates, though? While inflation does have an impact on the overall rate environment, the answer may not be as simple as you think. Inflation is just one of many factors that impact rates for home loans. The overall health of the economy, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the housing and bond markets also play roles in where mortgage rates are headed.\n\nThat said, there are some things to know about what this drop in inflation could mean for mortgage rates.\n\nFind out what your mortgage rate could be here.\n\nIs the inflation drop good news for mortgage rates?\n\nGenerally speaking, the inflation drop from January to February is good news for mortgage rates, even if rates aren't immediately headed downward. Jason Kindler, president of mortgage broker First Coast Mortgage Funding, says brokerages like his are happy with Wednesday's inflation news, all things considered.\n\n\"Today since the news, mortgage rates have been pretty stable,\" Kindle says, \"Overall we like the sentiment that [inflation] is less than expectations.\"\n\nThat being said, Kindler points out that homebuyers shouldn't be surprised that rates haven't fallen significantly. Economists believed inflation would be up 2.9% in February when, in reality, it rose 2.8%. When there's a 0.1 percentage point difference between inflation expectations and reality, \"we just don't feel any real impact immediately,\" Kindler says.\n\nBut, he says, mortgage rates could see a noticeable drop if next month's inflation report shows a second straight month of costs declining.\n\n\"If the next CPI comes out next month and it's looking a lot better for inflation, that will drive rates down,\" Kindler says.\n\nSteve Hill, a mortgage broker at SBL Lending, says inflation needs to ease over the long term before the Fed decides on rate cuts that could lead to significantly lower mortgage rates.\n\n\"In the long-term, lower inflation gives room for the Fed to lower rates, which is good news — but we're talking weeks or months down the road,\" Hill says.\n\nGet started and compare today's top mortgage loan rates now.\n\nWhere are rates headed for the rest of the year?\n\nWhile you shouldn't expect significant drops in mortgage rates right now, Kindler thinks rates could drop below 6% by the end of 2025.\n\nHill says he'd love to see rates get under 6%, but he's conflicted about whether that will happen.\n\n\"I love it if we got under 5.99% by the end of the year,\" Hill says. \"However, do I expect that? I'd say 50/50.\"\n\nShould you buy a home now or wait for rates to drop even further?\n\nIn general, prospective homebuyers may not want to wait for rates to drop before buying a home.\n\nToday's mortgage rates are averaging 6.82% for 30-year fixed mortgage loans and 6.13% for 15-year fixed mortgages. While those rates aren't as low as they were in September 2024, the average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans have been dropping since hitting just over 7% in January.\n\nIt might be tempting to wait and see if rates will fall further later this year, but that's a strategy that could cost you, Kindler says. If rates fall that low, homebuyers might face a competitive housing market flooded with potential buyers who were waiting for rates to drop before buying.\n\n\"If you're ready to move and it's in the budget, I don't think the right call is to wait,\" he says.\n\nHill also believes that waiting isn't the best idea. With so many factors at play in mortgage rates, timing the market is difficult.\n\n\"If you're ready to buy, go out there and find a home you love without being influenced by other factors, and realize that rates will come down eventually, whether it's one to two years from now or more,\" he says.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWednesday's inflation report is a positive sign for mortgage rates, as it signals, at least for the moment, that inflation is easing. That could lead to lower rates in the long term, but that's not a guarantee since multiple factors influence whether mortgage rates rise or fall. For now, prospective homebuyers would do well to buy a home if their budget allows, as waiting for rates to drop even more than they have over the past two months may end up costing them in the form of higher home values and limited inventory.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHELOCs could get more affordable this year as rates cool even further, experts say. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nA home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a built-in borrowing tool that homeowners with enough equity can access. This line of credit offers a way for homeowners to borrow against their home equity at an affordable rate, and the good news is that borrowing conditions are becoming even more favorable as HELOC interest rates are following a downward trajectory.\n\nThough HELOCs have variable interest rates and are subject to change, there have been numerous drops in HELOC borrowing rates recently. The average rate on a HELOC is now 8.03% — a two-year low.\n\nWill that downward trend continue, though? We spoke to home lending experts about where HELOC rates might be headed and what home equity borrowers should know.\n\nFind out how affordable home equity borrowing could be today.\n\nHow much further can HELOC interest rates fall?\n\nThe most recent Federal Reserve meeting in March resulted in no changes to the federal funds rate. In a statement, the Fed noted that elevated inflation and an increase in economic uncertainty were cited as reasons for keeping the rate the same.\n\nThe federal funds rate impacts rates on loan products, including HELOCs. As a result, the experts we spoke to think that HELOC rates are also likely to hold steady for now — but with potential drops of up to half a percent later this year.\n\n\"So I think in the short term they're going to stay where they are because I think they're waiting to see what will happen with tariffs and how that will affect the economy. But I do think by the end of the year, I'm anticipating rates coming down by about half a percent,\" says Jordan Heatherly, a mortgage loan originator at Churchill Mortgage.\n\nWhile significant HELOC rate drops might be further away, the experts we spoke to don't anticipate HELOC interest rates to head in the other direction, which is good news for borrowers.\n\n\"Any HELOC rate drops will happen lock-step with any changes the Fed makes to the Fed funds rate…It seems unlikely at this time that the Fed will raise rates; however, it will likely take longer than everyone had hoped to achieve a more normalized market, similar to what we experienced before the pandemic,\" says Sarah DeFlorio, vice president of mortgage banking at William Raveis Mortgage.\n\nCompare your home equity borrowing options online now.\n\nWhat needs to happen for HELOC interest rates to drop further?\n\nInflation has many Americans feeling the pinch, and higher interest rates lead to higher borrowing costs. During this wait-and-see moment, it's normal to wonder when HELOC interest rates will drop. For that to happen, it's more of an art than an exact science.\n\n\"We need to see that the Fed is confident that they have successfully mitigated inflation. It will probably take longer now due to the unknown impacts of tariffs and other potentially inflationary policies and macro events, including the ongoing wars in the Middle East and Europe,\" says DeFlorio.\n\nHow borrowers can benefit from a HELOC\n\nIf you want to borrow from your home's equity, you typically have three options: a home equity loan, a cash-out refinance or a HELOC. Home equity loan rates have an advantage in terms of offering borrowers fixed interest rates, which can be more beneficial in an uncertain rate environment, as the rates, and therefore the payments, stay the same unless you refinance the loan.\n\nA cash-out refinance lets you tap into your equity by borrowing more than your existing mortgage. It pays off your existing mortgage and you can \"cash out\" the rest, replacing your old mortgage loan with a new one at today's rates. Going this route may not be ideal in a high-rate environment, though, especially if you're one of the lucky ones with a low mortgage rate. More than half of mortgage borrowers have interest rates below 4%, according to a report from Realtor.com. Compare this to current 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates which are below 7%, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nHeatherly notes that HELOCs are a particularly attractive form of home equity borrowing right now because you don't touch your first mortgage, unlike a cash-out refinance, which replaces your existing mortgage. And while HELOC interest rates aren't rock bottom, they're still lower than other loan and credit products. So are home equity loan rates.\n\n\"When you look at home equity rates versus credit card rates versus personal loan rates, you know home equity beats it almost every time,\" says Jeff Ruben, president of WSFS Mortgage.\n\nCredit card debt in particular comes with steep rates. In the current environment, that could be higher than 20%, but current and prospective HELOC borrowers stand to benefit from the current environment and in the future when rates drop. Because HELOC Interest rates are variable, they may become more favorable throughout the year, which can help you save on borrowing costs.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you've amassed equity in your home, you have various options if you want to put it to good use. A home equity line of credit can be appealing due to its flexibility and its ability to keep your current mortgage rate intact. You can shop around with multiple HELOC lenders to see what you qualify for. It could be a good time to take this route, too, as HELOC rates have dropped in the last year. While there is currently some uncertainty about what's ahead, for now, it seems rates may continue to fall later this year.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Americans are witnessing a real-time dismantling of due process in this country, particularly when it comes to immigration enforcement. Last week, President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to label Venezuelan immigrants as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and summarily ship them to foreign prisons. On Thursday, The New York Times reported that administration lawyers determined the 18th-century law, historically reserved for wartime scenarios, could allow “federal agents to enter homes without a warrant.”\n\nThe civil liberties we all value and that form a foundational part of U.S. democracy are quickly disappearing under the guise of “national security” and “state secrets.” It’s a big reason why U.S. District Judge James Boasberg called the Trump administration’s initial response to his order blocking the deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants under the act “woefully insufficient.”\n\n“They’re not gonna stop us,” border czar Tom Homan declared on Fox News. “We’re not stopping. I don’t care what the judges think, I don’t care what the left thinks, we’re coming.”\n\nThe examples of why many critics have labeled ICE a ‘rogue’ agency are endless.\n\nThat level of open defiance didn’t come out of nowhere. Homan started at the Border Patrol as an agent in 1984 and rose through the ranks to serve as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump’s first term. He often boasts that he was the first ICE director to come up from within the agency. What he doesn’t say is that the agency was built to behave this way. From the beginning, ICE blurred the line between immigration enforcement and national security. It operated with few restraints and even fewer consequences.\n\nICE was created in 2003, when immigration enforcement was restructured in the wake of 9/11. As part of the newly formed Department of Homeland Security, the agency emerged from a climate of fear and mission creep, with a mandate that fused counterterrorism logic with immigration policy. The result was a militarized, opaque agency that quickly expanded its power. ICE now employs more than 20,000 people, and its budget is around $8 billion, almost triple what it was in 2003.\n\nAnd for the last two decades, it has operated with little public scrutiny.\n\nThe examples of why many critics have labeled ICE a “rogue” agency are endless. As early as 2011, under a Democratic administration, the American Civil Liberties Union was already documenting how mass immigration detention was ripping apart people’s lives. In one example, that 2011 report included the story of a Vietnam veteran and a permanent legal resident from Haiti who, at the time of the report, had been detained for eight years.\n\nSince then, the patterns have continued, as a 2020 ACLU report shows. In 2022, internal records revealed ICE agents had been using private data sources like utility bills and call records to conduct unauthorized surveillance. In 2023, Wired reported that ICE and its contractors “have faced internal investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement databases and agency computers” that led to “a swath of unlawful behavior, from stalking and harassment to passing information to criminals.”\n\n“Calling ICE a rogue agency doesn’t even quite get at how bad the problem is with them,” Emily Tucker, executive director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, told Wired in 2023. “They are always pushing to the limits of what they are allowed to do and fudging around the edges without oversight.”\n\nOne Venezuelan soccer player, deported despite having legally claimed asylum, was accused of gang affiliation because of a tattoo.\n\nOver the past few weeks, ICE and DHS have ramped up their most public-facing enforcement campaign yet. Shackled Venezuelan immigrants, heads shaven, were paraded through a maximum-security prison in El Salvador and broadcast to the world as a message. But family members of some deportees have pushed back hard on the narrative, according to NBC News.\n\nA mother recognized her son in the images from El Salvador, telling Telemundo that “he’s not a criminal. He has no criminal record,” and if he is being deported, the U.S. government “should send him back to his country of origin.”\n\nOne Venezuelan soccer player, deported despite having legally claimed asylum, was accused of gang affiliation because of a tattoo. His lawyer confirmed it was the logo of soccer team Real Madrid. CBS News later published the full list of names, raising more doubts about the credibility of the gang claims.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio from doubling down. Speaking with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Rubio said: “It is my view that judges do not have the right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. Go beyond the immigration issues that people focus on. These are alien enemies in our country. They’re an organized group undermining the national security of the United States, and that needed to be dealt with.”\n\nEven as this spectacle dominates headlines, other ICE abuses have gone under the radar. In New Mexico, the local ACLU filed a complaint alleging that at least 48 individuals have been “disappeared” by ICE. In Denver, longtime immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra was suddenly detained earlier this week. She’s the same activist named by Time in 2017 as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Immigrant rights groups have started a campaign for her release, though in this environment, the chances are slim to none.\n\nThe brazenness of these latest actions and the political forces backing them have reached even more extreme levels. Under Trump’s return, ICE has its strongest political ally yet. Enforcement is being ramped up with little regard for the courts, the justifications or the consequences.\n\nBut the speed and scale of expanded enforcement is only possible because of how ICE has been structured under a bipartisan consensus. The agency has long relied on subcontracted enforcement, including privately owned detention centers with poor oversight. These contractors profit from opaque systems with little accountability. When violations happen, blame is diffused. There’s always someone else to point to. Meanwhile, the government, under both Republicans and Democrats, keeps cutting the checks.\n\nThis is a critical moment to ask not just what ICE is doing, but what it was built to do. That should be a wake-up call for both immigrant communities and everyone who believes that due process and civil liberties must always be protected in this country. Trump’s extremism has a bipartisan foundation, and only by gutting and replacing that foundation can we have immigration enforcement that also respects justice.",

        "content": "If I were to ask readers to guess where they’d find the nation’s best K-12 public schools, they might not immediately think of the Defense Department’s educational system, but that would be an important oversight. As The New York Times reported in late 2023, “With about 66,000 students — more than the public school enrollment in Boston or Seattle — the Pentagon’s schools for children of military members and civilian employees quietly achieve results most educators can only dream of.”\n\nThe Times’ report added, “On the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal exam that is considered the gold standard for comparing states and large districts, the Defense Department’s schools outscored every jurisdiction in math and reading last year and managed to avoid widespread pandemic losses.”\n\nWith a record like this, it stands to reason that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would know not to mess with success. Alas, the former Fox News host has adopted a very different approach.\n\nLess than two weeks after Hegseth took the oath of office, The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon had begun “restricting access to books and learning materials covering subjects from immigration to psychology.” The article added, “The prohibited list also includes a bundle of instructional materials created for sixth-graders for Black History Month and a biography about Albert Cashier, a transgender man who served in the Union Army during the Civil War.” On-base school libraries have also been directed to remove books from shelves that don’t meet with Team Trump’s approval.\n\nThe developments were not well received. HuffPost reported soon after that more than two dozen House Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, denounced Hegseth’s “escalating censorship” and urged the Cabinet secretary to reverse course.\n\n“We are alarmed by reports that children at DoD schools were prevented from accessing any library books and many learning materials for a week while officials conducted a ‘review’ to identify any books that are related to the mysterious bodies of thought you call ‘discriminatory equity ideology’ or ‘gender ideology,’” they said. “After this week-long review, the nation’s military schools began purging library books and restricting access to books and learning materials that are reportedly undergoing ‘further review.’”\n\n“You are plainly violating the constitutional rights of DoD families,” the Democratic lawmakers added.\n\nJust as notable, if not more so, was the reaction from some of the affected students. Military.com reported late last week:\n\n“We Will Not Be Silent,” read one sign. “Our Education Is Not a Threat,” read another. Both messages were lofted by high school students, part of a group of roughly 100 who had walked out of their high school in Germany this month to protest books being banned and class courses being scrapped. ... Walkouts have happened at Defense Department schools in Japan, South Korea and Germany.\n\nIf you’ve watched “The Rachel Maddow Show” in recent weeks, you know we’ve been reporting quite a bit on Americans stepping up and speaking out in opposition to Trump administration policies. But when students organize a walkout at an on-base DOD high school, there’s a qualitative difference to keep in mind.\n\nAs the Military.com report added, “At a public school, the protest might have led to a detention and maybe some revoked after-school privileges. But on a military base, the students were putting more on the line. The same officials in charge of their Department of Defense-run school also had authority over their parents’ careers and status in the military.”\n\nThese students followed through on their protest anyway.\n\nComplicating matters, the problem isn’t limited to books and learning materials: The Military.com report went on to note that students and military families also recently learned that school sporting events had been canceled “because they were not deemed essential under Trump’s executive order seeking to implement Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, spending cuts.\n\n“Other school activities were also squeezed. Students on a culinary career track at their school weren’t able to practice cooking because of new $1 credit card limits for staff, preventing the school from buying ingredients and forcing kids to ask their parents to donate food.”\n\nIn early February, NBC News reported that military families protesting the Defense Department’s anti-DEI push “heckled” Hegseth upon his arrival at U.S. European Command headquarters in Germany, where he faced booing from some who lived at the base.\n\n“Protests by military families against a defense secretary are extremely rare,” the report added.\n\nProtests by military students are rare, too, though they’re apparently becoming more common.",

        "title": "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg exposed a new national security low for Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Suppose you were a spy for a hostile foreign power, trying to figure out how to steal America's secrets.\n\nIn years past, you might have tried to flip an FBI agent working on counterintelligence or planted a bug in the U.S. embassy. Or maybe you would have tasked a team of hackers with gaining access to the emails of members of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThese days, the question would be what you wouldn't do. Donald Trump’s first administration was so sloppy and uncaring about basic security protocols that a spy hoping to penetrate the U.S. government faced an embarrassment of riches from Mar-a-Lago to the Oval Office. His second administration, barely two months old, is already worse.\n\nThe most recent — and perhaps most egregious — example became public Monday when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, revealed that late last week he was inadvertently added to a group chat planning military strikes in Yemen involving accounts that appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Michael Waltz and other top officials.\n\nThe breach was so egregious that Goldberg at first figured it was the kind of stunt that conservative activists have used to pull to try to trick journalists. But he changed his mind (and exited the group) after details from the discussion matched U.S. strikes in Yemen Saturday. The chat's authenticity was subsequently confirmed by a spokesman for the National Security Council, who spun it as \"a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials.\" (Asked by reporters about the breach at a White House event, Trump said he knew \"nothing about it.\")\n\nThis kind of conversation about an upcoming military operation is normally conducted through a secure government channel or in what's known as a \"sensitive compartmented information facility.\" A SCIF is so secure that you're not even allowed to bring your cellphone into it. It follows logically that you shouldn't be holding those same conversations on a cellphone either, much less using commercial software such as Signal.If hacking Signal is too difficult, perhaps a foreign spy might find it easier to hack Starlink, the satellite internet service run by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Starlink has been installed around the White House as well as the General Services Administration and other federal agencies, according to a recent New York Times article. In 2022, a Belgian researcher demonstrated a method to hack Starlink terminals using off-the-shelf equipment that cost around $25.\n\nOr maybe an intelligence agency could recruit one of the tens of thousands of former federal workers forced out of their job by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. \"National security and intelligence experts\" recently told the Associated Press that the more former employees fired, the more likely it is that one or handful reach out to another country, whether out of anger or simply to pay the bills.\n\nIt can be hard to flip federal workers, though, as they are rigorously screened before hiring and typically serve the government out of a patriotic sense of duty. Maybe you'd find it easier as a spy to just rent an apartment in Trump Tower and get a membership at one of Trump's golf clubs so you can set up a meeting with him, as a Chinese fugitive with ties to organized crime did during Trump's first term, according to a ProPublica investigation.\n\nIf you bought a membership to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, you might even come across a few hundred classified documents while looking for a bathroom or walking through a gilded ballroom, as detailed in an indictment for a since-scuttled case against Trump.\n\nOr you could hang out in high-end D.C. restaurants, where during Trump's first term his lawyers were overheard by a New York Times reporter discussing details of several investigations into the administration. Or just wait for one of Trump's lawyers to inadvertently butt-dial your phone and listen in to his conversation — as Rudy Giuliani managed to do not once, but twice, in Trump's first term.\n\nEvery administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. But the Trump administration's errors are on an entirely different level.\n\nEvery administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as we were endlessly reminded in the 2016 campaign, had her own private email server installed at her house, which ended up handling a number of emails that included classified information. Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, was hacked by a simple \"change your password\" phishing email. Former president Joe Biden, among others, also had some classified documents at his house.But the Trump administration's errors in this area are on an entirely different level. The sheer scale and scope of its transgressions against standard operational security are mind-boggling.\n\nSome of this may be due to Trump's love of hiring outsiders without much government experience. Some of it may be due to disrespect for record-keeping laws. But the most straightforward answer is that Trump and the people he hires believe the rules don't apply to them, even if those rules were designed to protect their secrets — and ours.",

        "content": "Seven years ago, I wrote a column about an 11-year-old Black girl who was turned away from her Catholic elementary school near New Orleans because she showed up with her hair braided with extensions. About halfway through, I included what I believed to be an unobjectionable statement: “As black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s, any hair policy needs to be carefully considered lest it make some students vulnerable to breaking a rule that others couldn’t conceivably break.”\n\nA reader responded with a comment that was completely out of right field, but still illuminating: “What if Donald Trump said this: ‘As black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s,’ would a column be forthcoming about [him] making racist divisive remarks?”\n\nThe reflects an opinion that mentioning race is inherently problematic and that acknowledging racial differences is necessarily racist.\n\nBut Black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s. That’s a fact. The reader’s comment has stayed with me because it reflects an opinion held by far too many conservative white people, including those in this second Trump administration: that mentioning race is inherently problematic and that acknowledging racial differences is racist.\n\nBut when you don’t acknowledge that people are different you get outrages such as the “interim guidance” announced by the Marines this month: Marines who have pseudofolliculitis barbae (the fancy name for razor bumps) can now be “separated” (that is, discharged) if it isn't resolved in a year's time.\n\nAs much as I love the idea of shaving my face with a razor, I almost never do because the hair that grows back in invariably curls into my skin and causes painful bumps. And then I can’t shave without slicing into those bumps. Anybody who shaves can get razor bumps, but the American College of Osteopathic Dermatology says that pseudofolliculitis barbae occurs in up to 60% of African American men. An article in American Family Physician says the incidence is as high as 85%.\n\nA military dermatologist who spoke to Military.com said Black service members are about 15% of active-duty military but that “66% of shaving waiver holders are Black.”\n\nThe Marines claims the interim guidance is about upholding “standards of readiness, discipline and lethality,” but “separating” men with razor bumps would seem guaranteed to make the Marines weaker, not stronger.\n\nIn July 2021, the Journal of Military Medicine published a study that found “a significant association between shaving waivers and delays in promotion.” In October 2021, two dermatologists on active duty in the Air Force wrote a letter to the Air Force Times in response. “Contrary to the belief of some, PFB is often not manageable with anything other than a shaving profile allowing for just a short amount of hair growth,” wrote Lt. Col. Simon Ritchie and Lt. Col. Thomas Beachkofsky. “The notion that these members simply need to learn how to shave the right way is factually incorrect and contradicts what we, as dermatologists, know about this condition.”\n\nIt’s bad enough that Black service members have been denied promotions because close shaves are bad for them. It’s infinitely worse that the Marines is considering kicking out people with razor bumps.\n\nBut these are the types of policies you get when you hold the naïve and factually incorrect position that we are all the same and that one-size-fits-all policies are inherently fair.\n\nThere’s a framework that helps leaders of organizations think through policies that might seem fair and neutral on their face but result in some people in an organization having advantages or disadvantages that others don’t. That framework is known as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which has been maligned and effectively outlawed by Trump’s administration.\n\nPerhaps you’ve climbed aboard the anti-DEI train yourself, but if you think that it would be wrong and self-defeating for the military to kick out Marines who have faithfully served and protected our nation solely because their facial hair curls into their skin, then yours is a pro-DEI opinion.\n\nThe Trump administration is treating race (and sexual orientation and gender) as something not to be mentioned.\n\nLike the person in the comments section of the 2018 column I wrote, the Trump administration is treating race (and sexual orientation and gender) as something not to be mentioned. I don’t believe the people in the Trump administration are naïve; I believe that, in the main, their motivations are quite sinister. But their anti-DEI positions appeal to people who hold the simplistic view that everybody’s the same, believe that treating everybody the same is always right and believe that if we don’t acknowledge our differences then we’re bound to live happily ever after.\n\nSince Trump has taken office, we’ve seen the Air Force temporarily remove a training video about the heroic Tuskegee Airmen, we’ve seen the Department of Defense disparagingly add the letters DEI to the URL of a webpage celebrating Army Maj. Gen. Charles Gavin Rogers’ Medal of Honor and temporarily remove the page celebrating Jackie Robinson’s service as a second lieutenant in the Army. Three years before Robinson broke MLB's color line, he was wrongly court martialed — and ultimately acquitted — after refusing to sit in the back of a bus on an Army base.\n\nIf you think that talking about race is bad on its face, or that acknowledging the racism that Black people have endured in the military is bad on its face, then attempts at erasure such as these are inevitable.\n\nAnd in a more literal sense, a policy that kicks out men with razor bumps will be an erasure.\n\nWe’re not all the same. And the Marine's \"interim guidance\" is racist because it suggests that we are.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s administration wants to review the social media accounts of immigrants seeking long-term residency in the United States, potentially allowing the White House to bar critics from making the country their home.\n\nThe administration recently announced that it’s seeking public comment on its plan to obtain social media handles from immigrants seeking approval for extended stays, writing that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had “identified the need to collect social media identifiers (‘handles’) and associated social media platform names from applicants to enable and help inform identity verification, national security and public safety screening, and vetting, and related inspections.”\n\nResidents of other countries already have to provide social media handles when applying for travel visas in the U.S. This new proposal would expand that policy to people who apply for naturalization, permanent residency or asylum, and it comes as the administration seems intent on using the immigration system as an illiberal weapon to crack down on speech it doesn’t like.\n\nResidents of other countries already have to provide social media handles when applying for travel visas in the U.S.\n\nThe administration is currently carrying out deportation processes against Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal U.S. permanent resident who participated in pro-Palestinian protests last year amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The Department of Homeland Security has said he “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” but Khalil has not been charged with a crime or been convicted of any terror-related activity.\n\nThe administration also is trying to deport Badar Khan Suri, an academic from India working at Georgetown University, over allegations that he has ties to Hamas and has shared its propaganda online. As of this writing, a judge has temporarily thwarted the administration’s attempts to deport Suri. And France’s government alleged last week that a French scientist had been barred from entering the U.S. over messages found on his phone with his personal opinion about the Trump administration’s policies on academic research. A DHS official responded to the claim on social media, alleging — without providing evidence — that the scientist had been kept from entering because he had taken confidential information from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n\nIt’s certainly a heavy claim to lob without providing a hint of evidence to back it up. And it goes to show why many people are rightly concerned about expanding the administration’s ability to peruse through the social media accounts of immigrants already living here.\n\nThe public comment period for this proposal ends on May 5. If you are someone with thoughts on this attempt by the Trump administration to expand its powers, now is the time to make your voice heard.",

        "title": "Why the Boston Celtics’ new ownership could be a bad omen for all sports fans",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics, who have won more NBA championships than any other team, were sold for $6.1 billion last week, the most money ever for a professional sports franchise in North America. But outgoing minority owner Steve Pagliuca, whose bid was rejected, suggested the sale could mean bad news for the team’s faithful fans because of the private equity money reportedly going into the purchase.\n\nSixth Street, a Boston private equity firm, is putting $1 billion toward the purchase.\n\nThe team is being bought by a group led by Bill Chisholm, managing partner of private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. A person familiar with the matter told CNBC that Sixth Street, a Boston private equity firm, is putting $1 billion toward the purchase. Pagliuca believes his offer was better, and he dropped a warning all sports fans should take note of. “We made a fully guaranteed and financed offer at a record price, befitting the best sports fans in the world, and with all the capital coming from individuals who are fully committed to winning on and off the court,” Pagliuca wrote on X Thursday.\n\n“We had no debt or private equity money that would potentially hamstring our ability to compete in the future. We have felt it was the best offer for the Celtics.”\n\nPagliuca is likely disappointed that his offer was spurned for a group of Johnny-come-latelies. Still, his calling out private equity money should raise eyebrows because he himself is a senior adviser at Bain Capital. Pagliuca is telling Celtics fans that there’s a conflict between the interests of private equity money and a commitment to winning. If anyone would know about the mindset at private equity firms, he would.\n\nHe’s a private equity guy who knows what such firms want, and he sees that as enough of a potential challenge for the Celtics to say so publicly — before NBA owners vote to approve the sale.\n\nSixth Street already owns a piece of the San Antonio Spurs and landed a deal for 10% of Major League Baseball’s San Francisco Giants the same week as the Celtics purchase.\n\nA faceless, big-money group owning a sliver of the Celtics may not immediately cause alarm. But we’re witnessing a creeping shift in sports ownership that could have big future implications. Most American pro teams are still owned by individuals, families or investor groups that combine the two. For better or worse, owners are often the faces of their franchises. That’s why their personalities become associated with their teams’ personalities and why fans and journalists hold them personally accountable when their teams stink or there’s some scandal.\n\nEverybody knows Jerry Jones owns the Dallas Cowboys and Robert Kraft owns the New England Patriots. As for the Celtics, outgoing owner Wyc Grousbeck sat in front of cameras himself to announce he was suspending then-Celtics coach Ime Udoka for having a personal relationship with a team employee.\n\nOwners are often the faces of their franchises. That’s why fans hold them personally accountable when their teams stink.\n\nWhen Grousbeck’s group bought the Celtics in 2002, the team was struggling. It hadn’t won a championship in 16 years. Grousbeck will be remembered in Boston for drafting superstars like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and assembling rosters that made it to four NBA Finals and won two championships.\n\nNothing’s to say that private equity owners won’t have similar success, but as Pagliuca must know, such firms are best known for cold-blooded efficiency. We’ve seen them downsize companies however they can: cutting salaries, selling off underperforming units, mass layoffs and holding fire sales on real estate.\n\nDo such firms expect that business model to translate to pro sports, where profits depend on television broadcast contracts, sponsorship deals, revenue sharing and sweetheart arena leases struck with local officials who consider teams civic assets right along with public water infrastructure? Will such investors be as willing to spend up to the NBA’s salary cap or to exceed it with “luxury tax” spending? Might they be even more cutthroat than some individual owners have been about relocating teams if local officials and taxpayers balk at building new stadiums or arenas?\n\nOr will the opposite be true and their billions kick off a spending spree that sends player salaries further into the stratosphere.\n\nAnswers to those questions are forthcoming because private equity ownership of U.S. sports teams is likely to expand. In the case of the San Francisco Giants’ Sixth Street deal, financial details weren’t disclosed, but with the team valued at a reported $4.2 billion, that would mean a $420 million cash infusion to a franchise that plays in a league with no salary cap.\n\nLast year, the NFL, for the first time, approved the sale of as much as 10% of teams’ equity to a list of approved private equity investors, with Sixth Street among them. Last month, the New York Giants’ owners said they’re looking into selling a minority stake, and you can be sure all the approved firms are taking a look.\n\nOne way or another, most sports fans will soon know just how many strings are attached to private equity firms’ purses, and whether they care more about winning and entertaining their fans or squeezing out a profit.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When Donald Trump has an important personnel decision to make, the president too often looks to people he knows personally, as if he were the head of a social club and its members are entitled to certain perks — such as powerful positions in the executive branch of a global superpower.\n\nThis is especially true for the Republican’s former lawyers. Pam Bondi was part of one of Trump’s legal teams, and she’s the attorney general. Todd Blanche was one of his criminal defense attorneys, and he’s now also helping lead the Justice Department. Emil Bove represented Trump before being tapped to serve as the principal associate deputy attorney general. D. John Sauer was also a Trump lawyer, and the president tapped him to serve as the solicitor general.\n\nIn case the list weren’t already long, as NBC News reported, it just got longer.\n\nTrump announced to Truth Social that Alina Habba, who is serving as counselor to the president, will be the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. ... The move is “effective immediately,” Trump said. He said John Giordano, the current interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey, is being nominated as the ambassador to Namibia.\n\nTo be sure, Habba’s work has not been limited to serving as a member of Trump’s legal team. The Republican lawyer — who has no experience as a prosecutor, but who’ll now oversee a federal office with 150 prosecutors — also worked at the pro-Trump Save America PAC, before also working as a campaign spokesperson last year.\n\nBut Habba’s legal work is arguably the most notable part of her recent résumé. It was Habba, for example, who represented Trump in the E. Jean Carroll case, which he lost, and then again in the civil case against the Trump Organization’s civil fraud case, which he also lost.\n\nIn another notable case, Habba helped file a bizarre lawsuit targeting Hillary Clinton and several other Democrats in 2022, which proved so ridiculous that a judge imposed harsh sanctions on Habba for bringing “political grievances masquerading as legal claims” to court.\n\n“This case should never have been brought,” the judge added. “Its inadequacy as a legal claim was evident from the start. No reasonable lawyer would have filed it.”\n\nHabba filed it anyway. It now appears that she’s receiving a reward.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, however, is the degree to which Team Trump is brazenly and shamelessly politicizing federal law enforcement, following years of baseless complaints about Democrats politicizing federal law enforcement. Habba is, if nothing else, a partisan brawler, one who delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention and who appears to revel in attacking Democrats during frequent Fox News appearances.\n\nThe New York Times’ report on Habba’s promotion noted, “U.S. attorneys are traditionally nonpartisan.” Those traditions and norms were thrown out the window as of two months ago.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court’s landmark press freedom ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan is still safe — for now. On Monday, the court declined to review Republican donor Steve Wynn’s petition that asked the justices to overturn the 1964 precedent’s “actual malice” standard, which public figures must meet to bring defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe denial of Wynn’s petition was on the court’s routine order list Monday morning. Ahead of the list’s publication, a clue that the court would reject the petition was that The Associated Press (which Wynn, a casino mogul who reportedly donated more than $1 million to groups that supported Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, wanted to sue) waived its right to even respond to it, and the court didn’t request a response, which it sometimes does when at least one justice thinks it’s warranted.\n\nSo it wasn’t surprising that the court rejected Wynn’s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. What was less clear heading into Monday was whether any of the justices would dissent from the denial. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — two of the court’s six GOP-appointed justices — have previously questioned the Sullivan precedent, but they didn’t do so on Monday. That doesn’t mean their views have changed or that the precedent will stay on the books forever as challenges to it continue. But Wynn’s rejection is the latest evidence that it isn’t immediately at risk at the high court.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "The Trump administration has a high bar in trying to remove the Perkins Coie judge",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Justice Department wants to remove U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell from the Perkins Coie case, after the Obama-appointed judge curbed President Donald Trump’s order targeting the law firm. But as I explained during U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s handling of Trump’s classified documents case, it’s a high bar to remove a judge — so the Trump administration shouldn’t bank on getting rid of Howell.\n\nRecall that the DOJ under then-special counsel Jack Smith didn’t take the step that the DOJ under Trump is taking against Howell. When Smith appealed Cannon’s decision to dismiss Trump’s documents case, outside groups supporting Smith called for her ouster; but the appeals court didn’t rule before Trump won the 2024 election, after which Smith moved to dismiss the case based on DOJ policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\nBut with the DOJ making a motion for Howell’s disqualification, we should get a court ruling on the subject.\n\nAnd what is the Justice Department arguing? From its motion filed Friday, here’s a summary of the government’s position why, in its words, the judge “has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President” in several past cases in addition to the present one:\n\nExamples include this Court enabling the improper efforts of disgraced former prosecutor Jack Smith despite a readily apparent lack of venue in this District; wrongly suggesting in public that President Trump is an authoritarian; and incorrectly finding that President Trump — the most well-known man on Earth — presents a flight risk where even the prior Administration’s Department of Justice had to retract such a suggestion. This Court’s comments at the hearing on the meritless motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) in this case, including gratuitous and biased references by this Court regarding the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller (“Mueller Report”), confirm that reasonable observers may view this Court as incapable of fairly adjudicating these claims against the Commander-In-Chief.\n\nAt the outset, there’s an important distinction to draw between a judge’s rulings and other things such as their outside comments, relationships and the like. That’s because, according to a Supreme Court precedent that the DOJ cites in its disqualification motion, rulings alone “almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.”\n\nTo be sure, the DOJ doesn’t only cite Howell’s rulings. DOJ lawyers pointed to a 2023 speech she gave at a conference in which, they wrote, she “lamented that America is at a ‘crossroads’ and, in an apparent reference to President Trump, indicated that one path would lead to authoritarianism.” They also cited her remark at a hearing in the Perkins Coie case about Trump having “a bee in his bonnet.”\n\nWhen it comes to judicial statements, a party has an even more difficult task when the statements come from the judge’s participation in the relevant legal proceedings, as opposed to from what’s known as an “extrajudicial” source. That subject came up when Trump tried to remove U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan from his other federal criminal case, and she rejected his motion, citing that distinction.\n\nWhile there are distinctions between the situations, it would be surprising if Howell rules differently than Chutkan did when she decides on the motion. Given the high bar for disqualification, if she does in fact deny it, then the Trump DOJ could have a tough time if it presses the matter on appeal.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The exchange didn’t generate a lot of attention, but Donald Trump held a brief Q&A with reporters last week aboard Air Force One, and one journalist reminded the president, “There’s been some criticism that the Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times; they were all during times of war.” The Republican quickly replied, “Well, this is a time of war.”\n\nThat might’ve come as a surprise to many Americans, because, in reality, the United States is not currently engaged in any wars.\n\nThe fact that Trump claimed otherwise dovetailed nicely with a New York Times op-ed from Georgetown University law professor David Cole, who explained that while the White House’s recent violations of civil liberties are “profoundly disturbing,” they’re not unprecedented. Cole explained, however, what’s different about 2025: “Virtually every time previous presidents took such extreme steps, they acted in response to at least a plausible threat to national security. This time, Mr. Trump has invoked emergency powers in the absence of any even plausible emergency.”\n\nIt helps explain why the president said that United States is now in “a time of war”: He needs it to be in order to justify his efforts to curtail civil liberties.\n\nTo that end, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News last week that Venezuelan gang members are “no different than ISIS.” He added, “This is about a wholesale shift on what a terrorist is and how they should be treated in the United States, how they should be treated when they are attacking our soil.”\n\nAs MSNBC’s Chris Hayes recently summarized, “They’re taking all the Bush-Cheney war on terror arguments and applying them to the basic nuts and bolts of immigration policy and enforcement.”\n\nIn case this weren’t quite enough, this “wholesale shift” in how the White House is expanding the definition of “terrorist” also apparently includes those who commit acts of vandalism at Tesla dealerships. “I view these as terrorists,” Trump told reporters on Friday.\n\nTwo days later, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared on Fox News — again — and claimed that some had thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla dealerships, which she believes “could be a weapon of mass destruction.”\n\nTraditionally, officials have reserved the “WMD” label for nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Team Trump, however, appears to be engaged in “a wholesale shift” on what a weapon of mass destruction is, too.\n\nIf you’re thinking this is going to get worse before it gets better, you’re not alone.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 22 episode of “Velshi.”\n\nDictators fear freedom of speech more than any other right because it is the beating heart of a free, democratic society. People who are free to speak are free to challenge authority, share ideas and organize, all of which undermine tyranny. This is why a true measure of a nation’s freedom can be seen in how much dissent it is willing to tolerate — and in a vibrant democracy, dissent is valued, not simply tolerated.\n\nIn the 1700s, the American framers, having recently freed themselves from British rule that suppressed free speech and persecuted dissent, understood the crucial role the First Amendment would play in protecting citizens from government overreach. Benjamin Franklin observed: “Whoever would overthrow the liberty of the nation, must begin by subduing the freedom of speech; a thing terrible to publick traitors.”\n\nA true measure of a nation’s freedom can be seen in how much dissent it is willing to tolerate, and in a vibrant democracy, dissent is valued, not simply tolerated.\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that Donald Trump’s administration has set its sights on America’s universities, institutions that serve as major centers of deliberation and free inquiry, institutions that have historically been principal sites and incubators of dissent and protest. If speech can be effectively chilled in these critical intellectual spaces, it makes it much easier to silence the broader public.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has threatened universities with massive cuts to federal funding if they don’t submit to his agenda, which includes dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning what Trump is calling “illegal protests.”\n\nOn March 10, the administration notified 60 universities that they are under investigation for what it alleges is a failure to protect students from antisemitism on campus and warned the schools they could face “potential enforcement actions” as a result. It comes at a time when there is an active debate on college campuses about what constitutes antisemitism and whether protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza would be included in that definition.\n\nThe Trump administration also announced that it was investigating 52 schools for using what it calls “racial preferences and stereotypes” in their educational programs and activities, essentially a continuation of its attack on DEI initiatives. Last week, the White House announced that it was pausing $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies. And in a move that stunned the academic community nationwide, the Trump administration attempted to exert unprecedented control over Columbia University by threatening to cut $400 million in federal funding unless the school met a long list of demands — among them, placing its Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies under academic receivership for at least five years.\n\nDespite widespread calls from across the academic world urging Columbia to defend its independence, it appears that the university’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, has conceded to Trump’s demands. Armstrong announced several new measures, including a ban on masks to conceal identities, the hiring of 36 campus officers with the authority to arrest students and the appointment of a new senior vice provost to review “programs in regional areas across the University, starting immediately with the Middle East.”\n\nMeanwhile, running parallel to these investigations and threats, the Trump administration has been deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to campuses to seize international students who have no criminal records and are accused of no crimes but who have participated in protests or online criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, their school’s investments in Israel, America’s military support of Israel or the continuing war itself.\n\nTrump’s assault on academia has prompted massive opposition, with growing calls for administrators to resist this assault on academic independence. J Street, a Jewish lobbyist group, issued a statement blasting the administration’s actions: “While Trump will stop at nothing to attack higher education, we remain firm in our belief that universities are a tool for empathy, understanding and academic freedom.\n\n“If the administration was serious about fighting antisemitism,” the statement continues, “it would listen to Jewish students; it would seek to calm campus tensions rather than escalate them; and it might start by throwing out the slew of bigots and conspiracy theorists it has promoted to top positions in its own ranks.”\n\nUniversity presidents, from Wesleyan’s Michael Roth to Princeton’s Christopher Eisgruber, have joined in condemning the administration’s assault on higher education. In The Atlantic, Eisgruber wrote: “The attack on Columbia is a radical threat to scholarly excellence and to America’s leadership in research. Universities and their leaders should speak up and litigate forcefully to protect their rights.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to seize control of academia are part of a broader campaign to neutralize institutions that could potentially threaten his power. From law firms and media outlets to government inspectors general and federal judges, the administration is targeting every major institution that could challenge its agenda.\n\nBut Trump’s threats to cut off funding to some of the world’s premier research universities and deport students are especially alarming because the consequences of this intellectual retreat are not theoretical.\n\nDuring the Red Scare of the early 1950s, the U.S. government expelled hundreds of immigrants, including Chinese students, effectively gifting the Chinese government with trained U.S. scientists and engineers. One of those scientists was Qian Xuesen; today he’s known as the father of China’s ballistic missile program. The odd twist of fate was summed up by Nicholas Sung in Just Security this way: “The very Chinese missiles that threaten Taiwanese and American security are the legacy of the U.S. government’s profiling and deportation of a Chinese scientist.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to seize control of academia are part of a broader campaign to neutralize institutions that could potentially threaten his power.\n\nFormer U.S. Navy Secretary Dan Kimball, who fought to keep Qian in this country, was less polite in his criticism of the calls for the Chinese scientist’s deportation, saying at the time that it was “the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a communist than I was, and we forced him to go.”\n\nQian wasn’t the only victim of the Red Scare. Among its earliest victims was, in fact, the federal workforce. It would eventually sweep up thousands of innocent Americans, destroying careers and reputations. According to historian Beverly Gage: “The anti-Communist surge reshaped every institution in American life: Hollywood, labor unions, churches, universities, elementary schools — and, above all, the national-security state. ... From on high, they told ordinary Americans how to live, whom to love, and what to say.”\n\nToday, a similar pattern is emerging — and make no mistake, MAGA hysteria won’t be confined to America’s campuses. Karen Attiah, a columnist for The Washington Post, warns: “For now, the threat is directed at ‘others’: Palestinians, undocumented immigrants, trans people. ... For this kind of strategy to work, there must be an intentional creation of distance between human beings, the illusion that they are different from us, and that the weapons we throw at them are from a comfortable distance.”\n\nAttiah added: “This distance is and has always been a delusion — a profoundly dangerous weakness that America touts as strength. ... Unless a groundswell of popular resistance moves to meaningfully stop the Trump administration’s targeting of Columbia and students, the rest of America will be considered prey. It is a matter of when, not if.”",

        "title": "HIV is no longer a death sentence. Trump could change that.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "NBC News reported this week that President Donald Trump’s administration is thinking about getting rid of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that focuses on HIV prevention and giving those responsibilities to the Department of Health and Human Services. There’s apparently another potential plan, a source told NBC News, that would cut up to $700 million from the CDC’s HIV division.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next. Just how far will any of this go or end? When I was diagnosed, I was prescribed antiretrovirals, and, within months, my viral load dropped to undetectable levels. The virus has remained undetectable since then, and I am now healthy and thriving. I’ve come a long way from the opportunistic infections I was constantly dealing with at the time of my diagnosis.\n\nThen, I was barely insured and terrified that I might never recover. Within months, my insurer rescinded my health insurance policy. How was I going to pay out of pocket for the costly medications I needed to keep me alive?\n\nI soon learned about the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. It provides HIV primary care, treatment and supportive services for low-income people living with HIV. The law provides a safety net that covers the copays for my HIV prescription, which would otherwise cost about $4,000 a month. This is stabilizing for my physical and mental health.\n\nPeople living with HIV work very hard to suppress the virus so that it cannot be detected in our blood because if the virus is undetectable, then it is “untransmittable.” That is, it cannot be passed on to others through sex. In short, treatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nKnowing we cannot expose our partners to HIV and pose no threat to others is affirming and liberating. It allows us to safely have pleasurable relationships with others and make babies.\n\nThe Trump administration has already worked to eliminate USAID and hamper PEPFAR (President Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which is credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003. Now, the CDC may be eliminating funding for HIV prevention or incorporating it into HHS’s Ryan White program. I and others in my community are nervous for the future of HIV treatment and the future of HIV prevention.\n\nTreatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nState and local health departments and community-based nonprofits depend on the CDC’s HIV division for HIV testing, HIV education, funding for the pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, funding and technical support in public health efforts. Removing funding for this could potentially fuel new cases. PrEP, when used correctly, can stop someone from acquiring HIV during intimate encounters.\n\nShoehorning HIV prevention services into the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, which provides HIV care, could overburden the program. Resources to serve the 1.2 million people living with HIV in the U.S. are already stretched thin. Resources can be even scarcer in the Deep South, especially in its rural and urban areas.\n\nAt the same time, House Republicans seem bent on slashing Medicaid.\n\nMany low-income or disabled people living with HIV depend on Medicaid for health care.\n\nI am more concerned than ever about the unraveling of safety nets that wrap around not only people living with HIV but anyone with a chronic health condition. Some days, everything seems under threat.\n\nTrump’s flurry of executive orders against DEI pose a particular danger to people like me, a Black person and member of the LGBTQ community. Many HIV prevention and treatment programs focus on LGBTQ people (sometimes trans people in particular), Black people and women. These programs for treatment and prevention may not be in alignment with Trump’s anti-DEI agenda.\n\nUntil this week, there was not a lot of talk from leaders in the HIV-positive community about preparing people living with HIV for potential service interruptions. In their defense, they didn’t have a crystal ball to predict this, and they have received no guidance from federal funding agencies. Nevertheless, that failure to plan or consider contingencies does not help clients or patients sleep better at night.\n\nWe can see from PEPFAR the consequences of reduced services or zero funding. Millions of lives are affected and rationing of medication and care has started in Africa.\n\nWhen might we need to start to rationing medication or care in the U.S.? I could probably last a couple of months but what then? Being undetectable and healthy is great. We’re living long lives now and getting old.\n\nToo many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nEven though I am trying to remain hopeful that any reshuffling of the CDC or Ryan White will be minimal, I realize hope is not a strategy. Too many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the southwest corner of France and noticed that many of the road signs were turned upside down. I was told farmers did that to protest government policies they opposed.\n\nIt seems to me that now’s the time to turn some things upside down in this country and fight back. We cannot let Trump make HIV a fatal disease again.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration’s antagonism toward media outlets that report on its massive and haphazard deportation plans has been a running theme this year.\n\nIn February, I reported on an alarming investigation that right-wing Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr opened into San Francisco radio station KCBS, which shared federal immigration agents’ live locations in connection with a raid in Northern California. And President Donald Trump’s so-called border czar, Tom Homan, has accused the media of putting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents at risk of being “ambushed” as they investigate the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe administration’s angst escalated Friday, with the Justice Department releasing a vague statement announcing that it had opened a criminal investigation into the “selective leak of inaccurate, but nevertheless classified, information from the Intelligence Community relating to Tren de Aragua.”\n\nThe statement then plunges fully into MAGA conspiracism, adding:\n\nWe will not tolerate politically motivated efforts by the Deep State to undercut President Trump’s agenda by leaking false information onto the pages of their allies at the New York Times. The Alien Enemies Proclamation is supported by fact, law, and common sense, which we will establish in court and then expel the TDA terrorists from this country.\n\nLast Thursday — that is, one day prior to the DOJ’s announcement — The New York Times reported that American intelligence agencies had “circulated findings last month that stand starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s claims” that Tren de Aragua was being directed within the United States by Venezuela’s government. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of immigrants to a widely decried prison in El Salvador and has controversially cited the Alien Enemies Act — a wartime law from 1878 that allows for special deportation activities in the event of an invasion — as justification.\n\nThe Justice Department’s statement certainly makes it seem like, above all, the Trump administration is fuming about the legal basis for its cruel immigration policy being undermined.\n\nFor the record: I’ve spoken with legal experts who’ve expressed confusion over the DOJ’s head-scratching claim that the leaks contained “inaccurate, but nevertheless classified, information.” It certainly appears that this investigation is more of a political publicity stunt than it is a legitimate fact-finding mission.",

        "title": "Why Trump’s latest late-night attack on law firms affects us all",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It was late Friday night, the day after his triumph over legal juggernaut Paul Weiss, that President Donald Trump issued his latest broadside against law firms.\n\nYou would be forgiven for missing it given the timing of its release. But it's worth paying attention to — as some lawyers in your life or on your screens are likely making clear by now.\n\nFirst, let me clear up what this latest attack even entails. It began with Trump issuing executive actions punishing three firms — Covington & Burling, which did not react; Perkins Coie, which fought back and won a partial temporary restraining order; and Paul Weiss, which ultimately capitulated to a deal announced last Thursday, the terms of which are still a matter of some debate. But the president has now directed Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a memo issued Friday night, to seek sanctions “against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.\"\n\nOther law firms are running scared — and lawyers I know are furious.\n\nIn the memo, Trump directed Bondi to do whatever is appropriate “to refer for disciplinary action any attorney whose conduct in Federal court or before any component of the Federal Government appears to violate professional conduct rules, including rules governing meritorious claims and contentions, and particularly in cases that implicate national security, homeland security, public safety, or election integrity.” And where she determines that conduct by a lawyer or law firm warrants sanctions or disciplinary action or where, based on her review of litigation against the federal government over the last eight years, she discovers “fraudulent” or “vexatious” litigation conduct, Trump directed her to recommend “additional steps that may be taken,” including the same suspension of security clearances or termination of contracts with the federal government that constituted the heart of his three earlier, law-firm specific executive orders.\n\nYes, some of Trump’s executive actions, as aimed at lawyers, seem to be purely performative. Revoking the security clearances of lawyers he has long complained about sounds punitive — until you realize this is the second time he has done it with respect to some of them. What's more, some of his allies concede that taking those clearances away for people like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James is more symbolic than substantive.\n\nSimilarly, directing the Justice Department to seek bonds — essentially asking the court to make a plaintiff post a security deposit of sorts — every time a plaintiff wants a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order against his administration? Scary in theory, but hardly so in practice, where judges control whether plaintiffs have to post any security, let alone a prohibitively expensive one that would deter litigation.\n\nBut the Friday night memo? Trump knows that his attacks on judges — who collectively have issued more than a dozen nationwide injunctions against his policies since his return to the White House — might be popular with his base, but aren’t exactly changing judicial behavior. Moreover, while judges decide cases, lawyers make them. And therefore once Paul Weiss offered Trump major concessions in exchange for the revocation of his executive action targeting the firm, other law firms are running scared — and lawyers I know are furious.\n\nPart of what explains their disgust is what Paul Weiss represents in the firmament of law firms. It is a longtime affiliate of progressive organizations, a reliable home for former Democratic political appointees, and historically, a champion of various civil rights causes. And, as The New York Times has observed, it has been led for nearly two decades by one of the legal profession’s most prominent Democratic donors and organizers, Brad Karp.\n\nIndeed, Karp's colleagues have included former partner Mark Pomerantz — who memorialized his pursuit of Trump's indictment by the Manhattan DA in a revealing book — and multiple former Democratic government officials who are current partners, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.\n\nIf Karp — aided by this generation’s GOP superlawyer, Bill Burck — was so eager to cut a deal (and one that included a commitment to eliminating all DEI practices and policies, according to Trump), what hope is there for the rest of Big Law?\n\nJudges have the power to declare what the law is and is not, but they can’t rule on cases that are never brought.\n\nTo be clear, the fear I hear is not about the topics that usually make law firms anxious. They’re not worried principally about average profits per partner (which at Paul Weiss has topped $7.5 million on the most recent reporting) or client retention. What worries them is how the Trump administration’s increasing disregard for the law can be contained if firms sideline themselves from the fight.\n\nAs one law firm partner reminded me, lawyers take for granted what most nonlawyers don’t understand: Judges have the power to declare what the law is and is not, but they can’t rule on cases that are never brought. And if law firms believe they’ll be investigated, or worse, simply for bringing cases that Trump considers frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith, they won’t bring them.\n\nThat’s OK, you might think. That’s what groups like the American Civil Liberties Union or Democracy Forward are for: to wage the major constitutional battles. But those groups and other so-called impact litigation groups have long partnered with law firms — and many of the landmark cases that even nonlawyers know by name have been law firm-led.\n\nTake the battle for marriage equality. The watershed case of Obergefell v. Hodges? Argued by Ropes & Gray partner Howard Hallward-Driemeyer. Some years earlier, United States v. Windsor declared that a federal statute refusing to recognize same-sex marriages was invalid. And who shepherded that case to and through the Supreme Court? Then-Paul Weiss partner Roberta Kaplan.\n\nOf course, then, as now, it is more common to hear public disdain of lawyers than it is to sing their praises. Even Shakespeare, in “Henry VI,” threw in a line that reeks of present-day schadenfreude: “The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers!” But 30 years ago, in a dissent, then-Justice John Paul Stevens reminded us that that line was “spoken by a rebel, not a friend of liberty.” Shakespeare, Stevens observed, “insightfully realized that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government.”\n\nThe question is: Will we?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Second lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland on Thursday, the White House announced, as part of a diplomatic trip to the massive frozen island. By going to a country that President Donald Trump has said he wants to buy or forcibly take, Vance’s visit will put her in the middle of one of the Trump administration’s least diplomatic acts of diplomacy, making it even harder to deny Trump’s blatant bullying.\n\nVance, who has kept a low profile since her husband, JD Vance, was sworn in as vice president, will be joined by one of the couple’s two sons. She said in an Instagram video that she’s especially looking forward to attending the country’s national dogsled race. “I’m also coming to celebrate the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between our two nations,” she added, “and to express hope that our relationship will only grow stronger in the coming years.”\n\nHer mild words do little to paper over the current tensions between the U.S. and Greenland. Trump has been clear that he hopes to acquire the island from Denmark, reportedly at least in part because of how huge it appears on the most common map projection. He’s also hinted that it should be acquired for vague national security reasons or to obtain the minerals under its permafrost. Neither Greenland nor Denmark has been particularly enthusiastic about by Trump’s remarks, even less so after Trump hinted that, if it were not put up for sale, he could take Greenland by force or economic leverage.\n\nBefore Vance’s trip commences, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz (the one who reportedly invited The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief into a Signal group where top secret military plans were shared) will also visit Greenland this week. According to The New York Times, Wright and Waltz will tour Pituffik Space Base, America’s northernmost military outpost.\n\nIt feels ridiculously unnecessary for Vance to be dragged into this mess as the soft power side of what’s clearly a good cop-bad cop routine. But, then again, the vice presidency has long been regarded as one of the least consequential roles in Washington. By the transitive property alone, the role of the vice president’s spouse must be up there as far as gigs go. Second ladies (or, as of recently, gentlemen) haven’t accumulated the same sort of cache as cultural icons that first ladies have, but that still doesn’t help explain the odd choice of Vance’s first solo destination.\n\nI can’t imagine that Greenland was at the top of Vance’s list of places she wanted to travel as second lady\n\nPoliticians in Greenland are ripping apart Vance’s rationale for traveling to Greenland. The country recently held parliamentary elections in which two parties that want independence from Denmark took the top spots. Neither party holds enough seats to claim a majority, and talks to form a new government are ongoing.\n\nNotably, the smaller party has had warm words for the Trump administration, but there’s been little support from the larger public regarding Trump’s overtures. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, head of the larger party in the potential coalition, told the Times, “The fact that the Americans are well aware we are in the middle of negotiations once again shows a lack of respect for the Greenlandic people.”\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Múte Egede called Vance’s visit a “highly aggressive” attempt to influence the new government and said that “it can in no way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician’s wife.” Egede said, “What is the security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”\n\nWho knows? Maybe Vance really did want to visit Greenland to watch a dog race with her kid. Maybe she got recruited to go simply as a boost to Waltz and Wright’s trip. Whichever it is, Vance is no rube. She’s highly accomplished and sophisticated; that is, she’s smart enough to know that her trip signals support for Trump’s ambitions toward Greenland. She could have declined to go if she didn’t want to send that message.\n\nNo offense to the Greenlandic people, but I can’t imagine that Greenland was at the top of Vance’s list of places she wanted to travel as second lady. Greenland knows why she’s there, and her trip likely won’t do anything to foster the “mutual respect and cooperation” she touts in her video.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "During Donald Trump’s presidential transition process, there were plenty of rumors that billionaire Howard Lutnick was well positioned to lead the Treasury Department — one of the most sought-after positions in any White House Cabinet. The Associated Press reported that Elon Musk, among others, even lobbied on his behalf.\n\nThose efforts ultimately fell short, and Trump tapped Lutnick to serve as the commerce secretary. As for why, exactly, he didn’t get a more prominent position, The Bulwark reported two weeks after Election Day that Lutnick kept “shooting himself in the foot” by making needlessly provocative public comments that annoyed the incoming Republican team. The report quoted a Trump adviser who said Lutnick needed to learn how to “shut the f--- up.”\n\nFour months later, the same problem persists. Lutnick announced that the president was preparing to waive taxes on Americans earning under $150,000 per year, only to walk that back soon after. He urged a national television audience to buy stock in Tesla, sparking an ethics controversy the White House struggled to defend.\n\nCommon sense might’ve suggested that Lutnick would start avoiding microphones for a while, but instead, as USA Today reported, he made matters vastly worse.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested this week that only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check — but honest people like his mother would simply live with the fact that the government didn’t mail their monthly payment.\n\nDuring an appearance on a conservative podcast, the billionaire said, “Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain. She just wouldn’t. She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining.”\n\nIn case that wasn’t quite enough, Trump’s commerce secretary added that he and his colleagues know the “easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen.”\n\nBillionaires like Lutnick might not understand this, but for millions of struggling Americans, Social Security benefits are a critically important lifeline. A missing check for a month would mean they couldn’t buy groceries.\n\nWhen those folks call to complain about a Social Security check that didn’t arrive, it doesn’t mean they’re criminals. It means they’re hungry.\n\nIn a healthier political environment, out-of-touch nonsense like this would almost certainly lead to an unpleasant phone call in which the president urged his commerce secretary to choose a new career path.\n\nBut stepping back, there’s also a larger context to this. While Lutnick spoke publicly about a hypothetical scenario in which the Social Security Administration didn’t send checks for a month, the Trump administration’s acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration raised the prospect of shutting down the system that undergirds the agency, though he backtracked soon after.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the Trump administration also announced plans to slash the Social Security Administration’s workforce, while simultaneously forcing more Social Security beneficiaries to make in-person appearances at local offices that will have fewer employees.\n\nMartin O’Malley, who served as the Social Security commissioner in the Biden administration, appeared on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Friday night and said Trump administration officials had already taken 90% of the actions necessary to “crater” the agency. The former Democratic governor added that Americans “should be outraged.\n\nThe Washington Post published a much-discussed report the day after Christmas that highlighted the perspectives of several low-income voters who supported the Trump ticket in the 2024 elections. The article specifically referenced a middle-aged Pennsylvania woman who struggles to make ends meet despite receiving food stamps and Social Security benefits, who explained why she voted for the Republican ticket.\n\n“[Trump] is more attuned to the needs of everyone instead of just the rich,” the woman told the Post. “I think he knows it’s the poor people that got him elected, so I think Trump is going to do more to help us.”\n\nI wonder what her reaction was to Lutnick’s comments.",

        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 23 episode of \"Velshi.\"\n\nWhen Donald Trump entered office for the first time, he was quickly met with the so-called Resistance: On Jan. 21, 2017, one day after his inauguration, millions across the United States participated in the Women’s March, a protest against basically everything that Trump stood for.\n\nNow fast forward eight years to the weekend before Trump’s second inauguration. This time, the Women’s March had become the People’s March, and the turnout was much smaller and the effort a lot more modest. The muted response in the months between Election Day and Inauguration Day had many disappointed and frightened Americans wondering if their fellow citizens just felt too defeated and impotent. Maybe they were too scared to join a protest as a wannabe authoritarian returned to power, one who promised to shut down dissent and exact revenge against his political opponents.\n\nWe’re seeing a different kind of movement building right now, one that has had steady and sustained momentum.\n\nBut as the second Trump administration quickly got down to business — and enlisted the president's top campaign donor, Elon Musk, to help gut the civil service — Americans perked up. People began contacting their representatives. There were reports that some Congress members’ phone lines were ringing nonstop and their voicemail boxes were full. Across the country, people held protests in support of federal workers, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, veterans, scientists, the environment, the people of Ukraine, and the people of Gaza, and the list goes on and on and on.\n\nMany people have also turned up at town halls, especially those held by Republicans, to voice their anger and distress about what this administration is doing and the lack of pushback from Congress. On Friday, longtime Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa was booed by his constituents at a town hall. Many members of my immediate family have either run for or held elected office, so I know from experience that town halls aren’t typically so well-attended. You’d be lucky to fill half the seats in the room. But Grassley’s town hall was packed, and that’s been the case for many other town halls recently, both for Republicans and Democrats.\n\nOn Thursday, roughly 2,000 people reportedly showed up for a town hall hosted by Democrat Rep. Kelly Morrison of Minnesota. The state’s governor, Tim Walz, held a town hall of his own that reportedly had more than 1,500 attendees. In California, about 1,000 reportedly came out for Democratic Rep. Salud Carbajal’s town hall.\n\nRepublicans have faced such tough questions and sharp criticisms at their events — you’ve probably seen some of it go viral online — that GOP leadership has told its members to just stop doing town halls altogether. To counter that, some progressive groups have hosted “empty chair town halls.” People schedule these events and invite their representatives, and if the representatives don’t show up, the constituents voice their concerns to each other and to an empty chair that represents their member of Congress.\n\nSo while we haven’t seen a demonstration on the same scale as the 2017 Women’s March, something is happening. We’re seeing a different kind of movement building right now, one that has had steady and sustained momentum — and it's a movement that may change the political landscape as well, as many Americans look for leaders who will show up to fight for and with them.\n\nNobody understands this better than Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two progressive icons who have been pushing Democrats and the left to pursue a new path forward. In recent days, the pair have embarked on a tour called “Fighting Oligarchy,” and the turnout has been tremendous: 25,000 people were expected to attend their rally in Denver on Friday but, according to Sanders’ team, 34,000 people showed up — the largest rally of his career. It was also the largest in Denver since Barack Obama held a rally there in 2008. Another 23,000 people reportedly attended their stop in Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday, and 15,000 reportedly turned out in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nJust think about that for a second: Tens of thousands of people are showing up for political rallies, and the midterms are still more than a year and a half away. That’s unheard of, and it cannot be overlooked.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When Donald Trump and his team disclosed Social Security numbers while releasing documents related to the John F. Kennedy assassination, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem. When the president and his team sent non-criminals to a prison in El Salvador while falsely claiming that they were gang members, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem.\n\nWhen Team Trump’s DOGE operation repeatedly stepped on its own tail, including an instance in which it confused $8 billion and $8 million, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem. When the White House royally screwed up its Office of Management and Budget spending “freeze” memo, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem.\n\nBut to fully appreciate the truly galactic nature of Team Trump’s competence problem, one must read — and then re-read — the latest report from Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nIn a story so ridiculous that it almost defies description, much of the Trump administration’s national security team — Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House national security adviser Michael Waltz — organized a meeting to discuss plans for a military strike.\n\nThat might not sound especially notable, but these powerful officials didn’t meet to discuss an active military operation in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, where phones are not permitted. Rather, they help their chat by way of a Signal thread — and they inadvertently invited a journalist to participate.\n\nNo, seriously, that’s what happened.\n\nThe Atlantic’s editor-in-chief acknowledged that as this was happening, he was skeptical that the chat was authentic, which was understandable given the circumstances. But it was quite real, as confirmed by a spokesperson for the National Security Council. (When Goldberg came to realize that he was actually participating in in a chat involving high-ranking officials discussing a military operation, he exited.)\n\nTrying to summarize the reporting is difficult — please believe me when I tell you that it’s important to read the whole thing — and it’s challenging to know where to start. Indeed, the list of questions is not short. Did these officials break the law? Was this the first time they used a private chat for this purpose, or is this a routine practice in the Trump White House? How many of these people will be asked to resign in the wake of this humiliating debacle? How many will be fired?\n\nDo these guys always write as if they’re over-caffeinated middle schoolers playing video games? (Kevin Kruse, a historian at Princeton University, wrote in response to the reporting, “In private, these people seem immensely stupid.”) Do they remember what they said about Hillary Clinton, who was accused of using a private platform to discuss sensitive national security matter?\n\nBut as the political world comes to terms with the scope and scale of this genuine scandal, I’m stuck on the fact that the White House’s breathtaking incompetence appears to be undermining the national security of the United States in terrifying ways. Americans’ safety is in the hands of unqualified and inexperienced amateurs, who clumsily invited a journalist to join a chat about a military strike in a foreign country.\n\nFor his part, a reporter asked Donald Trump for his reaction to the revelations, just hours after The Atlantic published its report online. “I don’t know anything about it,” the president said. After taking a few rhetorical shots at the magazine, he again added: “I know nothing about it.”\n\nThat doesn’t make matters any better, given that he really ought to know something about it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Columbia University caved. After the Trump administration cut off $400 million in federal funding based on the claim that the university had failed to protect Jewish students from harassment during pro-Palestinian protests last year, the university has agreed to a series of demands that will make major changes to the university’s core functions, including the way it handles admissions, security and academic inquiry.\n\nTrump appears to view Columbia as a guinea pig for trying to limit free expression of ideas on college campuses.\n\nIf anyone were somehow still under the illusion that the MAGA right champions free speech, this may be the clearest example yet that President Donald Trump is in reality one of the country's greatest enemies of free speech. Strong-arming Columbia University is an affront to the First Amendment. And at a time of rising authoritarianism, Columbia’s concessions should be setting off sirens about the repression of free speech on campuses, one of the most essential spaces for dissent in American life.\n\nMy colleague Clarissa Jan-Lim summarized the concessions so far:\n\nIn a memo issued Friday afternoon, the university said it will ban face masks “for the purpose of concealing one’s identity”; hire 36 “special officers” empowered to arrest students and remove them from campus; appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; adopt a formal definition of antisemitism; review its admission procedures to ensure those processes are “unbiased”; and commit to “greater institutional neutrality” — most of which address demands from the Trump administration.\n\nNotably, Columbia has declined to pursue legal challenges to Trump’s suppression agenda and decided to go along with many of its suggestions (some of which it was reportedly considering on its own).\n\nOne thing must be clear: Trump’s demands aren’t about protecting Jewish students from bigotry. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp writes, Trump is at the forefront of the pro-Israel, antisemitic right. Our president has posted antisemitic memes, dined with Holocaust-deniers, declared that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer isn’t Jewish and allied with militants who traffic in antisemitic ideology. He leads a movement brimming with antisemitic sentiment, and his movement’s theories of society and power rely on antisemitic tropes.\n\nAnd while there were reports of antisemitic conduct on Columbia’s campus last year, Trump has failed to demonstrate why those episodes warrant something so radical as ruining the university financially instead of letting the university deal with the issue on its own, as it already has been. As a group of legal scholars at Columbia University have pointed out in an article, Trump’s claims that Columbia violated provisions of the Civil Rights Act protecting Jewish students entail “no explanation of the alleged violations, no mention of a completed investigation, and no account of how Columbia has been deliberately indifferent to ongoing antisemitic discrimination or harassment on its campus — perhaps because any such account would be implausible at this time. There is therefore no apparent statutory basis for a funding cutoff.”\n\nA pro-Palestine rally at Columbia University in New York City in 2024. David Dee Delgado / Getty Images file\n\nTrump appears to view Columbia as a guinea pig for trying to limit free expression of ideas on college campuses. The new policing policies are likely to make students more afraid of expressing dissent on campus. They signal a radically punitive attitude toward the kind of spirited free expression that has long defined the political power of student movements. And after ICE conducted raids on Columbia’s property and the university harshly punished students who occupied buildings to express their support for Palestinians last year, it’s likely that many students at Columbia and elsewhere will hold their tongues rather than express their views of justice.\n\nTrump also appears to be trying to limit academic freedom. As The Wall Street Journal points out, while the academic changes to the university’s Middle East department aren’t formally being described as a receivership, “the changes align with what usually happens in a receivership.” The new senior vice provost, per the newspaper, is meant to “ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced.” It’s unclear what “balanced” means, but in the context of Trump’s broader aims it reads as an euphemism for pushing curricula and instruction to the political right. As Amherst political scientist Austin Sarat wrote in a recent column for MSNBC about Trump’s demands of Columbia, “One can (almost) admire the Trump administration’s ingenuity in using receivership as a smoke screen for censorship.”\n\nAccording to Reuters, Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors, called Trump’s demands “arguably the greatest incursion into academic freedom, freedom of speech and institutional autonomy that we’ve seen since the McCarthy era.” He added,​​ “I know every academic faculty member in this country is angry about Columbia University’s inability to stand up to a bully.”\n\nAcademia has long been a lifeblood of the left in America, the site of some of the most influential intellectual and political resistance to injustices in American society and politics. Trump is trying to put a muzzle on that resistance — before it even fully takes shape — as swiftly and aggressively as he can. It’s frightening that Columbia is helping Trump strap the muzzle on.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Several conservative organizations asked the Federal Communications Commission last week to end its investigation into CBS over a seemingly baseless complaint that the network wrongly altered an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has accused “60 Minutes” of running defense for the Harris campaign with selective editing. CBS has denied the allegation, and it said earlier this month that the complaint, brought by the conservative nonprofit Center for American Rights, “punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.” (It’s worth noting that Fox News edited some of its footage to shorten Trump’s rambling, false answers during a campaign Q&A event in October.)\n\nThe CBS complaint was dismissed in January by then-outgoing FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who warned the complaints sought to \"weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.” But Trump’s handpicked FCC chairman, Project 2025 co-author Brendan Carr, revived the complaint when he was tapped for the post — and now some conservatives seem to be in line with Carr’s predecessor in thinking the complaint should be dropped.\n\nAs Reuters reported Thursday:\n\nThe Center for Individual Freedom, Americans for Tax Reform, Taxpayers Protection Alliance and other groups called on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to end the investigation into the unit of Paramount Global, saying an “adverse ruling against CBS would constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs.”\n\nAlthough the request puts the groups at odds with Carr, it still includes some MAGA talking points. For example, the groups say they “understand and appreciate why many conservatives would seek to now ‘level the playing field’ and subject other media organizations — such as CBS’s parent company Paramount — to the same regulatory cudgel that has long afflicted conservative media.”\n\nBut the message was clear: These groups are fearful of the Trump administration taking action against CBS in this case (perhaps because they, too, see the baselessness in it) and don’t want conservative media outlets to be on the receiving end of such treatment if and when the executive branch is controlled by the Democratic Party again.\n\nCarr, for the record, doesn’t appear to share their worries. In a statement to Reuters, he vowed to continue this illiberal stunt.\n\n“The FCC’s review of the complaint against CBS remains active and ongoing,” he told Reuters. Ever since he was appointed, Carr has treated his position as a weapon to be wielded in Trump's war against the free press. He opened investigations into NPR and PBS, two media outlets reviled by Republicans. And just last week, he threatened to kill corporate mergers involving companies that have policies promoting diversity.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "At an Oval Office event on Friday, Donald Trump was asked about his administration using the Alien Enemies Act to fly some non-criminals to a prison in El Salvador. “I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process,” the president replied.\n\nFor now, let’s put aside the fact that there’s an enormous difference between a vetting process and due process. For that matter, let’s also stick a pin in the very important conversation about the nature of the administration’s “very strong” vetting process and the degree to which it appears to have failed.\n\nWhat also stood out for me about Trump’s answer, however, was the fact that he seemed to put some distance between himself and his policy. Instead of simply declaring that the White House did everything right, he said he was “told” — by whom, he didn’t say — that the process had merit.\n\nHours later, during a separate Q&A with reporters, the president went even further down the same road and suggested that he didn’t actually sign his own order invoking the Alien Enemies Act. NBC News reported:\n\nTrump appeared to indicate [Friday] that he did not sign a proclamation last week that invoked the Alien Enemies Act his administration used to justify recent deportation flights that have since sparked an intense court fight. He made the remark after being asked about a federal judge’s concerns about his use of the wartime law to deport Venezuelan immigrants despite being ordered not to.\n\nIn his unscripted comments, the president told reporters, “I don’t know when it was signed, because I didn’t sign it. Other people handled it.” The president then praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying, “He wanted them out, and we go along with that. We want to get criminals out of our country.”\n\nPressed for some kind of explanation, the White House later told CNN that Trump “was obviously referring to the original Alien Enemies Act that was signed back in 1798.”\n\nGiven the context, that was literally unbelievable. The exchange, which was on camera, clearly provided the necessary context: He was asked about the ongoing court case and the way in which his order was implemented.\n\nThe idea that Trump was saying he “didn’t sign” a federal law 227 years ago is plainly ridiculous.\n\nBut the fact that the president made these comments raised a variety of related questions. If, as Trump put it, he “didn’t sign” his own directive, why did the White House say he did? Did he use an autopen? Does the president, who routinely questions his immediate predecessor’s mental acuity, not remember the historically significant order he ostensibly signed a week earlier?\n\nA Washington Post analysis asked a variety of related questions: “So what did happen? Did Trump misspeak? Is he trying to deflect responsibility for a decision under heavy legal scrutiny by suggesting he was merely following through on an idea proposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio? And if he didn’t sign it, who — or what — did?”\n\nI don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this one.",

        "content": "In 2003, when I first walked through the doors of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), one of the first things I noticed was the wall of fallen heroes, RFE/RL journalists murdered for simply reporting the truth. Their names and photos were a chilling reminder that this wasn’t just a job. It was a mission.\n\nBefore then, I’d already reported from some of the world’s most dangerous places, most recently as the Afghanistan bureau chief for the Turkish news agency IHA. But nothing prepared me for that moment in September 2006 when I sat at my desk, and the editor on duty announced: “We are leading today’s news hour with the killing of Ogulsapar Muradova.”\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was the wall of fallen heroes, RFE/RL journalists murdered for simply reporting the truth.\n\nMuradova, RFE/RL’s correspondent in Turkmenistan, had been arrested there weeks before. Her family was later told to collect her body—bruised, battered and bearing the unmistakable signs of torture. There was no autopsy. No court case. No justice.\n\nHer crime? Reporting the news.\n\nOn March 15, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) terminated RFE/RL’s federal funding grant, along with that of its sister organization, Radio Free Asia, and placed the vast majority of Voice of America staff on administrative leave—effectively gutting the organization and silencing its work. The justification? Cost-cutting.\n\nBut this isn’t just a budget cut. In the words of RFE/RL President Stephen Capus, “It would be a massive gift to America’s enemies, the dictators” who have spent decades trying—and failing—to silence RFE/RL.\n\nFor nearly 75 years, RFE/RL has been a voice for those silenced by their own governments, from the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc to today’s authoritarian regimes in Central Asia, Russia, Iran and beyond. It has exposed corruption, countered disinformation and provided a rare platform for citizens to speak out in places where doing so can mean prison—or worse.\n\nDuring Tajikistan’s civil war, RFE/RL’s Tajik service, Radio Ozodi, became the country’s most trusted news source. When the Turkmen government outright banned the word “COVID-19” during the pandemic, RFE/RL was the only source telling the truth about the virus.\n\nAcross its broadcast region, RFE/RL’s investigative work has led to real change: schools suddenly repaired, electricity restored, health crises averted, officials forced to act on citizen complaints—simply because RFE/RL exposed their failures.\n\nRFE/RL’s investigative work has led to real change: schools suddenly repaired, electricity restored, health crises averted, officials forced to act on citizen complaints.\n\nThough despised by those in power, our words were impossible to ignore. During my time as director of RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service, Azatlyk, it was widely known that transcripts of our daily broadcasts reached the president’s desk.\n\nThat is the power of free media. That is the power the U.S. government is now poised to destroy.\n\nThe U.S. will save $142 million per year cutting RFE/RL —less than the price of a single F-35A fighter jet.\n\nElon Musk called for the shutdown of U.S.-funded media, including RFE/RL, in a February post on X. That paved the way for its downfall. Last year, Musk’s company SpaceX launched 138 Falcon 9 rockets. RFE/RL’s annual budget of $142 million costs less than two Falcon 9 flights. And unlike billion-dollar space tourism ventures, which benefit a handful of billionaires, RFE/RL serves 47.4 million people every week\n\nFrom Moscow to Beijing, Tehran to Kabul, authoritarian regimes have long understood that their greatest threat is not foreign armies, but free information. That’s why they have jailed, tortured and murdered journalists. That’s why they have expelled foreign media, banned independent outlets and built firewalls to block the truth from reaching the people.\n\nAnd now, instead of continuing to promote free information and democracy, America is handing those authoritarian regimes exactly what they want.\n\nSince the Cold War, RFE/RL has been America’s most powerful soft power tool, a direct challenge to the lies and propaganda of authoritarian states. As Natan Sharansky and other former prisoners of communism have testified, RFE/RL was a source of hope, a reminder that America had not forgotten them.\n\nToday, that mission is as urgent as ever.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has turned state media into an engine of military propaganda. China’s influence operations have expanded across Asia, Africa and Europe. The Taliban runs Afghanistan’s airwaves. Iran censors the internet and jails dissenters. And yet, as authoritarianism rises, America is retreating from the fight.\n\nThe void left by RFE/RL’s shutdown won’t remain empty for long.\n\nWill it be filled by independent journalism? No.\n\nThe void left by RFE/RL’s shutdown won’t remain empty for long.\n\nIt will be filled by Russian disinformation. By Chinese Communist Party propaganda. By Iranian state-controlled outlets spewing anti-Western rhetoric. By the Taliban’s “Mullah Radio.”\n\nThis decision not only weakens America’s influence; it actively undermines President Trump’s own stated policy goals on free speech. It contradicts everything the U.S. has claimed to stand for: freedom of the press, support for democracy and a commitment to human rights.\n\nAnd for what? To save a fraction of a fraction of the federal budget?\n\nAs these broadcasts go silent, I think of the journalists who risked everything to report for RFE/RL. Many are still in prison, their futures uncertain. They include:\n\nIhar Losik (RFE/RL Belarus Service) — jailed since June 2020.\n\nVladyslav Yesypenko (RFE/RL Ukrainian Service) — detained in Crimea in 2021.\n\nFarid Mehralizada (RFE/RL Azerbaijani Service) — imprisoned since May 2024.\n\nNika Novak (RFE/RL Russian Service) — arrested in 2023 for exposing Kremlin corruption\n\nCutting RFE/RL means they’ve now been abandoned by the country that once stood behind them.\n\nAnd what about the dozens of RFE/RL, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia journalists working in Prague and Washington on European and U.S. work visas? Without a job their visas will be terminated. Many of them cannot return to their home countries because their governments consider them enemies.\n\nThis is not what they signed up for.\n\nDuring my time at RFE/RL, U.S. congressional delegations from both sides of the aisle, along with foreign secretaries, repeatedly stood in our newsroom and thanked our journalists and acknowledged their role in bringing democracy to the places that needed it most.\n\nDo any of the Republicans who used to praise RFE/RL still have the courage to do the same?\n\nToday, as autocracies rise and democracy backslides, do any of the Republicans who used to praise RFE/RL still have the courage to do the same?\n\nThis decision isn’t just about RFE/RL. It’s about America’s commitment to the truth, to freedom, to the very ideals it once championed on the global stage.\n\nIf this administration allows RFE/RL to die, it will not just be a mistake of phenomenal proportion, but it will also be a historic abdication of America’s role in the world.\n\nAnd the cost will be paid by millions who are left voiceless.",

        "title": "Trump’s promise to preserve Social Security may not survive DOGE",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has said multiple times that he has no plans to cut Social Security. That suggests he understands the old political axiom that Social Security is the third rail in American politics. Touch it and get torched.\n\nBut we see something different in his administration’s actions. The marauding DOGE brigade has taken an ax to the bedrock program with staff cuts, leadership changes and office closures, and it has recently announced a new policy that would reduce the opportunities for people to conduct Social Security business over the phone. Even Republicans who have supported Trump have expressed concern about the downsizing efforts and the caustic rhetoric that could undermine public trust in the nation’s largest federal program and hurt their senior and disabled constituents who rely on Social Security.\n\nSocial Security is the third rail in American politics. Touch it and get torched.\n\nThere’s a long list of reasons we can’t fully trust this administration’s stewardship over the Social Security Administration, but let’s start with the following six signs.\n\nThe top reason is obvious. The administration needs to make big cuts to fulfill Elon Musk’s promise to trim 20% from the federal budget of $6.8 trillion and extend tax cuts for wealthy people. It’s impossible to make good on that promise without raiding programs that have heretofore been politically untouchable. Musk’s chainsaw approach — including shuttering offices and slashing federal staffing — is not gonna get to that 20% mark. The Social Security Administration paid $120 billion in benefits to more than 67 million people in 2024, providing benefits to elderly people, disabled people and dependents.\n\nReason No. 2: Musk and other DOGE leaders don’t understand how Social Security works. SSA employees have reported that the new DOGE-approved leadership team has shown little interest in learning about the inner workings of the massive and massively complicated agency, and Musk has wrongly disparaged it as a “Ponzi scheme.”\n\nThat rhetoric leads to the third reason on this list. This administration seems to care little about the American public or the government’s public servants. You see that in the way it has gutted federal departments and fired hundreds of people with little empathy for their plight. You see that in the closure of field offices and the scaling back of help lines with seemingly no regard for how elderly or disabled recipients or beneficiaries will get help. And you certainly saw it in the cavalier comments from billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if the Social Security Administration failed to send her check.\n\n“She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month,” Lutnick said on the “All-In Podcast.” Pushing the false narrative that fraud is rampant among those receiving Social Security payments, Lutnick went on to say that “the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen.”\n\nWhoever screams, he said, are the people who’re stealing. I think it’s safe to say that very few people, regardless of their political affiliations, would be quiet if their Social Security payments didn’t arrive.\n\nClocking in at No. 4: Its laser focus on eradicating DEI notwithstanding, the Trump administration either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about our country’s changing demographics. While Trump has appointed more women to his Cabinet than any other Republican president, his Cabinet doesn’t mirror the demographics of the country in terms of race, veteran’s status or ethnicity — but especially not in terms of income and wealth.\n\nBiden’s Cabinet was collectively worth $118 million; in January, the members of Trump’s Cabinet were collectively worth more than $460 billion.\n\nPublic Citizen reports that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet was collectively worth $118 million; in January, the members of Trump’s Cabinet were collectively worth more than $460 billion. The average salary in the U.S. is $66,621 according to the SSA’s national wage index.\n\nThe DOGE team’s buzz saw approach to Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare is where the administration’s disinterest in demographics is particularly glaring. By the end of this year, almost 12,000 people in the U.S. will be turning 65 daily as all those Baby Boomers stampede into retirement. Social Security staffing was already at a 50-year low, and the administration plans to further cut 7,000 workers, or almost 12% of the staff.\n\nA fifth reason Social Security is likely to continue to go through the DOGE wringer is its vast trove of sensitive information. Data holds value — especially in the world of technology, where software and apps are constantly scooping up personal information. The Social Security Administration touches almost every working American in some way, and SSA employees have traditionally taken strict steps to protect all that data. Access is limited even within the administration’s various departments, and SSA employees annually take an oath to protect that information. Even inadvertently disclosing data could result in a five-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine for every violation, Laura Haltzel, former associate commissioner at the SSA, said on the podcast “You Earned This.”\n\nThere’s no evidence that DOGE marauders who swept into the Social Security Administration allegedly looking for waste, abuse and fraud signed a similar oath or that they consider Americans’ data sacred.\n\n“The magnitude of the data that is being shared through DOGE is so much bigger than probably most people even realize,” Haltzel said.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration conflates need with weakness and associates wealth with strength. Musk seems to view the program as excessive largesse and not money people have earned. Yes, earned with FICA payroll tax deductions that have been taken out of their paychecks every week with the full expectation that they would get some assistance in their elderly years. (FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act — and those deductions earn future credits for Social Security benefits.)\n\nSocial Security is a social contract that has worked in this country for 90 years, and while the billionaire class has no need to pay attention to the FICA deduction in paychecks, voters in both red and blue America will indeed notice if their Social Security payments don’t appear. They will complain. It will be loud. And it will be justified.\n\nAbout one-quarter of the aged live in households that receive at least 90% of family income from Social Security.\n\nTo say it is a lifeline is not an understatement. According to a 2017 report from the Social Security Administration, “roughly half of the aged population live in households that receive at least 50 percent of total family income from Social Security and about one-quarter of the aged live in households that receive at least 90 percent of family income from Social Security.”\n\nIf Trump breaks his promise to protect Social Security, that’s devastatingly bad news for America. Social Security is an anti-poverty program, and ending it or even severely curtailing it would have catastrophic effects.\n\nSocial Security is called a third rail for a reason. And if Trump and his billionaire aids touch it they’ll give Democrats the issue they need to wage a righteous fight on behalf of all Americans.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Americans are witnessing a real-time dismantling of due process in this country, particularly when it comes to immigration enforcement. Last week, President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to label Venezuelan immigrants as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and summarily ship them to foreign prisons. On Thursday, The New York Times reported that administration lawyers determined the 18th-century law, historically reserved for wartime scenarios, could allow “federal agents to enter homes without a warrant.”\n\nThe civil liberties we all value and that form a foundational part of U.S. democracy are quickly disappearing under the guise of “national security” and “state secrets.” It’s a big reason why U.S. District Judge James Boasberg called the Trump administration’s initial response to his order blocking the deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants under the act “woefully insufficient.”\n\n“They’re not gonna stop us,” border czar Tom Homan declared on Fox News. “We’re not stopping. I don’t care what the judges think, I don’t care what the left thinks, we’re coming.”\n\nThe examples of why many critics have labeled ICE a ‘rogue’ agency are endless.\n\nThat level of open defiance didn’t come out of nowhere. Homan started at the Border Patrol as an agent in 1984 and rose through the ranks to serve as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump’s first term. He often boasts that he was the first ICE director to come up from within the agency. What he doesn’t say is that the agency was built to behave this way. From the beginning, ICE blurred the line between immigration enforcement and national security. It operated with few restraints and even fewer consequences.\n\nICE was created in 2003, when immigration enforcement was restructured in the wake of 9/11. As part of the newly formed Department of Homeland Security, the agency emerged from a climate of fear and mission creep, with a mandate that fused counterterrorism logic with immigration policy. The result was a militarized, opaque agency that quickly expanded its power. ICE now employs more than 20,000 people, and its budget is around $8 billion, almost triple what it was in 2003.\n\nAnd for the last two decades, it has operated with little public scrutiny.\n\nThe examples of why many critics have labeled ICE a “rogue” agency are endless. As early as 2011, under a Democratic administration, the American Civil Liberties Union was already documenting how mass immigration detention was ripping apart people’s lives. In one example, that 2011 report included the story of a Vietnam veteran and a permanent legal resident from Haiti who, at the time of the report, had been detained for eight years.\n\nSince then, the patterns have continued, as a 2020 ACLU report shows. In 2022, internal records revealed ICE agents had been using private data sources like utility bills and call records to conduct unauthorized surveillance. In 2023, Wired reported that ICE and its contractors “have faced internal investigations into abuse of confidential law enforcement databases and agency computers” that led to “a swath of unlawful behavior, from stalking and harassment to passing information to criminals.”\n\n“Calling ICE a rogue agency doesn’t even quite get at how bad the problem is with them,” Emily Tucker, executive director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, told Wired in 2023. “They are always pushing to the limits of what they are allowed to do and fudging around the edges without oversight.”\n\nOne Venezuelan soccer player, deported despite having legally claimed asylum, was accused of gang affiliation because of a tattoo.\n\nOver the past few weeks, ICE and DHS have ramped up their most public-facing enforcement campaign yet. Shackled Venezuelan immigrants, heads shaven, were paraded through a maximum-security prison in El Salvador and broadcast to the world as a message. But family members of some deportees have pushed back hard on the narrative, according to NBC News.\n\nA mother recognized her son in the images from El Salvador, telling Telemundo that “he’s not a criminal. He has no criminal record,” and if he is being deported, the U.S. government “should send him back to his country of origin.”\n\nOne Venezuelan soccer player, deported despite having legally claimed asylum, was accused of gang affiliation because of a tattoo. His lawyer confirmed it was the logo of soccer team Real Madrid. CBS News later published the full list of names, raising more doubts about the credibility of the gang claims.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio from doubling down. Speaking with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Rubio said: “It is my view that judges do not have the right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. Go beyond the immigration issues that people focus on. These are alien enemies in our country. They’re an organized group undermining the national security of the United States, and that needed to be dealt with.”\n\nEven as this spectacle dominates headlines, other ICE abuses have gone under the radar. In New Mexico, the local ACLU filed a complaint alleging that at least 48 individuals have been “disappeared” by ICE. In Denver, longtime immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra was suddenly detained earlier this week. She’s the same activist named by Time in 2017 as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Immigrant rights groups have started a campaign for her release, though in this environment, the chances are slim to none.\n\nThe brazenness of these latest actions and the political forces backing them have reached even more extreme levels. Under Trump’s return, ICE has its strongest political ally yet. Enforcement is being ramped up with little regard for the courts, the justifications or the consequences.\n\nBut the speed and scale of expanded enforcement is only possible because of how ICE has been structured under a bipartisan consensus. The agency has long relied on subcontracted enforcement, including privately owned detention centers with poor oversight. These contractors profit from opaque systems with little accountability. When violations happen, blame is diffused. There’s always someone else to point to. Meanwhile, the government, under both Republicans and Democrats, keeps cutting the checks.\n\nThis is a critical moment to ask not just what ICE is doing, but what it was built to do. That should be a wake-up call for both immigrant communities and everyone who believes that due process and civil liberties must always be protected in this country. Trump’s extremism has a bipartisan foundation, and only by gutting and replacing that foundation can we have immigration enforcement that also respects justice.",

        "content": "If I were to ask readers to guess where they’d find the nation’s best K-12 public schools, they might not immediately think of the Defense Department’s educational system, but that would be an important oversight. As The New York Times reported in late 2023, “With about 66,000 students — more than the public school enrollment in Boston or Seattle — the Pentagon’s schools for children of military members and civilian employees quietly achieve results most educators can only dream of.”\n\nThe Times’ report added, “On the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal exam that is considered the gold standard for comparing states and large districts, the Defense Department’s schools outscored every jurisdiction in math and reading last year and managed to avoid widespread pandemic losses.”\n\nWith a record like this, it stands to reason that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would know not to mess with success. Alas, the former Fox News host has adopted a very different approach.\n\nLess than two weeks after Hegseth took the oath of office, The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon had begun “restricting access to books and learning materials covering subjects from immigration to psychology.” The article added, “The prohibited list also includes a bundle of instructional materials created for sixth-graders for Black History Month and a biography about Albert Cashier, a transgender man who served in the Union Army during the Civil War.” On-base school libraries have also been directed to remove books from shelves that don’t meet with Team Trump’s approval.\n\nThe developments were not well received. HuffPost reported soon after that more than two dozen House Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, denounced Hegseth’s “escalating censorship” and urged the Cabinet secretary to reverse course.\n\n“We are alarmed by reports that children at DoD schools were prevented from accessing any library books and many learning materials for a week while officials conducted a ‘review’ to identify any books that are related to the mysterious bodies of thought you call ‘discriminatory equity ideology’ or ‘gender ideology,’” they said. “After this week-long review, the nation’s military schools began purging library books and restricting access to books and learning materials that are reportedly undergoing ‘further review.’”\n\n“You are plainly violating the constitutional rights of DoD families,” the Democratic lawmakers added.\n\nJust as notable, if not more so, was the reaction from some of the affected students. Military.com reported late last week:\n\n“We Will Not Be Silent,” read one sign. “Our Education Is Not a Threat,” read another. Both messages were lofted by high school students, part of a group of roughly 100 who had walked out of their high school in Germany this month to protest books being banned and class courses being scrapped. ... Walkouts have happened at Defense Department schools in Japan, South Korea and Germany.\n\nIf you’ve watched “The Rachel Maddow Show” in recent weeks, you know we’ve been reporting quite a bit on Americans stepping up and speaking out in opposition to Trump administration policies. But when students organize a walkout at an on-base DOD high school, there’s a qualitative difference to keep in mind.\n\nAs the Military.com report added, “At a public school, the protest might have led to a detention and maybe some revoked after-school privileges. But on a military base, the students were putting more on the line. The same officials in charge of their Department of Defense-run school also had authority over their parents’ careers and status in the military.”\n\nThese students followed through on their protest anyway.\n\nComplicating matters, the problem isn’t limited to books and learning materials: The Military.com report went on to note that students and military families also recently learned that school sporting events had been canceled “because they were not deemed essential under Trump’s executive order seeking to implement Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, spending cuts.\n\n“Other school activities were also squeezed. Students on a culinary career track at their school weren’t able to practice cooking because of new $1 credit card limits for staff, preventing the school from buying ingredients and forcing kids to ask their parents to donate food.”\n\nIn early February, NBC News reported that military families protesting the Defense Department’s anti-DEI push “heckled” Hegseth upon his arrival at U.S. European Command headquarters in Germany, where he faced booing from some who lived at the base.\n\n“Protests by military families against a defense secretary are extremely rare,” the report added.\n\nProtests by military students are rare, too, though they’re apparently becoming more common.",

        "title": "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg exposed a new national security low for Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Suppose you were a spy for a hostile foreign power, trying to figure out how to steal America's secrets.\n\nIn years past, you might have tried to flip an FBI agent working on counterintelligence or planted a bug in the U.S. Embassy. Or maybe you would have tasked a team of hackers with gaining access to the emails of members of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThese days, the question would be what you wouldn't do. Donald Trump’s first administration was so sloppy and uncaring about basic security protocols that a spy hoping to penetrate the U.S. government faced an embarrassment of riches from Mar-a-Lago to the Oval Office. His second administration, barely two months old, is already worse.\n\nThe most recent — and perhaps most egregious — example became public Monday when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, revealed that late last week he was inadvertently added to a group chat planning military strikes in Yemen involving accounts that appeared to be those of Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Mike Waltz and other top officials.\n\nThe breach was so egregious that Goldberg at first figured it was the kind of stunt that conservative activists have used to pull to try to trick journalists. But he changed his mind (and exited the group) after details from the discussion matched U.S. strikes in Yemen on Saturday. The chat's authenticity was subsequently confirmed by a spokesman for the National Security Council, who spun it as \"a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials.\" (Asked by reporters about the breach at a White House event, Trump said he knew \"nothing about it.\")\n\nThis kind of conversation about an upcoming military operation is normally conducted through a secure government channel or in what's known as a \"sensitive compartmented information facility.\" A SCIF is so secure that you're not even allowed to take your cellphone into it. It follows logically that you shouldn't be holding those same conversations on a cellphone, either, much less using commercial software such as Signal.\n\nIf hacking Signal is too difficult, perhaps a foreign spy might find it easier to hack Starlink, the satellite internet service run by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Starlink has been installed around the White House, as well as the General Services Administration and other federal agencies, according to a recent New York Times article. In 2022, a Belgian researcher demonstrated a method to hack Starlink terminals using off-the-shelf equipment that cost around $25.\n\nOr maybe an intelligence agency could recruit one of the tens of thousands of former federal workers forced out of their jobs by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. \"National security and intelligence experts\" recently told The Associated Press that the more former employees who are fired, the likelier it is that one or a handful reach out to another country, whether out of anger or simply to pay the bills.\n\nIt can be hard to flip federal workers, though, as they are rigorously screened before hiring and typically serve the government out of a patriotic sense of duty. Maybe you'd find it easier as a spy to just rent an apartment in Trump Tower and get a membership at one of Trump's golf clubs so you could set up a meeting with him, as a Chinese fugitive with ties to organized crime did during Trump's first term, according to a ProPublica investigation.\n\nIf you bought a membership to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, you might even come across a few hundred classified documents while looking for a bathroom or walking through a gilded ballroom, as detailed in an indictment for a since-scuttled case against Trump.\n\nOr you could hang out in high-end D.C. restaurants, where during Trump's first term his lawyers were overheard by a New York Times reporter discussing details of several investigations into the administration. Or just wait for one of Trump's lawyers to inadvertently butt-dial your phone and listen in to his conversation — as Rudy Giuliani managed to do not once but twice in Trump's first term.\n\nEvery administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. But the Trump administration's errors are on an entirely different level.\n\nEvery administration has its share of snafus, security failures and oversights. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as we were endlessly reminded in the 2016 campaign, had her own private email server installed at her house, which ended up handling a number of emails that included classified information. Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, was hacked by a simple \"change your password\" phishing email. Former President Joe Biden, among others, also had some classified documents at his house.\n\nBut the Trump administration's errors in this area are on an entirely different level. The sheer scale and scope of its transgressions against standard operational security are mind-boggling.\n\nSome of this may be due to Trump's love of hiring outsiders without much government experience. Some of it may be due to disrespect for recordkeeping laws. But the most straightforward answer is that Trump and the people he hires believe the rules don't apply to them, even if those rules were designed to protect their secrets — and ours.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Seven years ago, I wrote a column about an 11-year-old Black girl who was turned away from her Catholic elementary school near New Orleans because she showed up with her hair braided with extensions. About halfway through, I included what I believed to be an unobjectionable statement: “As black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s, any hair policy needs to be carefully considered lest it make some students vulnerable to breaking a rule that others couldn’t conceivably break.”\n\nA reader responded with a comment that was completely out of right field, but still illuminating: “What if Donald Trump said this: ‘As black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s,’ would a column be forthcoming about [him] making racist divisive remarks?”\n\nThe reflects an opinion that mentioning race is inherently problematic and that acknowledging racial differences is necessarily racist.\n\nBut Black people’s hair is generally different from white people’s. That’s a fact. The reader’s comment has stayed with me because it reflects an opinion held by far too many conservative white people, including those in this second Trump administration: that mentioning race is inherently problematic and that acknowledging racial differences is racist.\n\nBut when you don’t acknowledge that people are different you get outrages such as the “interim guidance” announced by the Marines this month: Marines who have pseudofolliculitis barbae (the fancy name for razor bumps) can now be “separated” (that is, discharged) if it isn't resolved in a year's time.\n\nAs much as I love the idea of shaving my face with a razor, I almost never do because the hair that grows back in invariably curls into my skin and causes painful bumps. And then I can’t shave without slicing into those bumps. Anybody who shaves can get razor bumps, but the American College of Osteopathic Dermatology says that pseudofolliculitis barbae occurs in up to 60% of African American men. An article in American Family Physician says the incidence is as high as 85%.\n\nA military dermatologist who spoke to Military.com said Black service members are about 15% of active-duty military but that “66% of shaving waiver holders are Black.”\n\nThe Marines claims the interim guidance is about upholding “standards of readiness, discipline and lethality,” but “separating” men with razor bumps would seem guaranteed to make the Marines weaker, not stronger.\n\nIn July 2021, the Journal of Military Medicine published a study that found “a significant association between shaving waivers and delays in promotion.” In October 2021, two dermatologists on active duty in the Air Force wrote a letter to the Air Force Times in response. “Contrary to the belief of some, PFB is often not manageable with anything other than a shaving profile allowing for just a short amount of hair growth,” wrote Lt. Col. Simon Ritchie and Lt. Col. Thomas Beachkofsky. “The notion that these members simply need to learn how to shave the right way is factually incorrect and contradicts what we, as dermatologists, know about this condition.”\n\nIt’s bad enough that Black service members have been denied promotions because close shaves are bad for them. It’s infinitely worse that the Marines is considering kicking out people with razor bumps.\n\nBut these are the types of policies you get when you hold the naïve and factually incorrect position that we are all the same and that one-size-fits-all policies are inherently fair.\n\nThere’s a framework that helps leaders of organizations think through policies that might seem fair and neutral on their face but result in some people in an organization having advantages or disadvantages that others don’t. That framework is known as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which has been maligned and effectively outlawed by Trump’s administration.\n\nPerhaps you’ve climbed aboard the anti-DEI train yourself, but if you think that it would be wrong and self-defeating for the military to kick out Marines who have faithfully served and protected our nation solely because their facial hair curls into their skin, then yours is a pro-DEI opinion.\n\nThe Trump administration is treating race (and sexual orientation and gender) as something not to be mentioned.\n\nLike the person in the comments section of the 2018 column I wrote, the Trump administration is treating race (and sexual orientation and gender) as something not to be mentioned. I don’t believe the people in the Trump administration are naïve; I believe that, in the main, their motivations are quite sinister. But their anti-DEI positions appeal to people who hold the simplistic view that everybody’s the same, believe that treating everybody the same is always right and believe that if we don’t acknowledge our differences then we’re bound to live happily ever after.\n\nSince Trump has taken office, we’ve seen the Air Force temporarily remove a training video about the heroic Tuskegee Airmen, we’ve seen the Department of Defense disparagingly add the letters DEI to the URL of a webpage celebrating Army Maj. Gen. Charles Gavin Rogers’ Medal of Honor and temporarily remove the page celebrating Jackie Robinson’s service as a second lieutenant in the Army. Three years before Robinson broke MLB's color line, he was wrongly court martialed — and ultimately acquitted — after refusing to sit in the back of a bus on an Army base.\n\nIf you think that talking about race is bad on its face, or that acknowledging the racism that Black people have endured in the military is bad on its face, then attempts at erasure such as these are inevitable.\n\nAnd in a more literal sense, a policy that kicks out men with razor bumps will be an erasure.\n\nWe’re not all the same. And the Marine's \"interim guidance\" is racist because it suggests that we are.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s administration wants to review the social media accounts of immigrants seeking long-term residency in the United States, potentially allowing the White House to bar critics from making the country their home.\n\nThe administration recently announced that it’s seeking public comment on its plan to obtain social media handles from immigrants seeking approval for extended stays, writing that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had “identified the need to collect social media identifiers (‘handles’) and associated social media platform names from applicants to enable and help inform identity verification, national security and public safety screening, and vetting, and related inspections.”\n\nResidents of other countries already have to provide social media handles when applying for travel visas in the U.S. This new proposal would expand that policy to people who apply for naturalization, permanent residency or asylum, and it comes as the administration seems intent on using the immigration system as an illiberal weapon to crack down on speech it doesn’t like.\n\nResidents of other countries already have to provide social media handles when applying for travel visas in the U.S.\n\nThe administration is currently carrying out deportation processes against Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal U.S. permanent resident who participated in pro-Palestinian protests last year amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The Department of Homeland Security has said he “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” but Khalil has not been charged with a crime or been convicted of any terror-related activity.\n\nThe administration also is trying to deport Badar Khan Suri, an academic from India working at Georgetown University, over allegations that he has ties to Hamas and has shared its propaganda online. As of this writing, a judge has temporarily thwarted the administration’s attempts to deport Suri. And France’s government alleged last week that a French scientist had been barred from entering the U.S. over messages found on his phone with his personal opinion about the Trump administration’s policies on academic research. A DHS official responded to the claim on social media, alleging — without providing evidence — that the scientist had been kept from entering because he had taken confidential information from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n\nIt’s certainly a heavy claim to lob without providing a hint of evidence to back it up. And it goes to show why many people are rightly concerned about expanding the administration’s ability to peruse through the social media accounts of immigrants already living here.\n\nThe public comment period for this proposal ends on May 5. If you are someone with thoughts on this attempt by the Trump administration to expand its powers, now is the time to make your voice heard.",

        "title": "Why the Boston Celtics’ new ownership could be a bad omen for all sports fans",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics, who have won more NBA championships than any other team, were sold for $6.1 billion last week, the most money ever for a professional sports franchise in North America. But outgoing minority owner Steve Pagliuca, whose bid was rejected, suggested the sale could mean bad news for the team’s faithful fans because of the private equity money reportedly going into the purchase.\n\nSixth Street, a Boston private equity firm, is putting $1 billion toward the purchase.\n\nThe team is being bought by a group led by Bill Chisholm, managing partner of private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. A person familiar with the matter told CNBC that Sixth Street, a Boston private equity firm, is putting $1 billion toward the purchase. Pagliuca believes his offer was better, and he dropped a warning all sports fans should take note of. “We made a fully guaranteed and financed offer at a record price, befitting the best sports fans in the world, and with all the capital coming from individuals who are fully committed to winning on and off the court,” Pagliuca wrote on X Thursday.\n\n“We had no debt or private equity money that would potentially hamstring our ability to compete in the future. We have felt it was the best offer for the Celtics.”\n\nPagliuca is likely disappointed that his offer was spurned for a group of Johnny-come-latelies. Still, his calling out private equity money should raise eyebrows because he himself is a senior adviser at Bain Capital. Pagliuca is telling Celtics fans that there’s a conflict between the interests of private equity money and a commitment to winning. If anyone would know about the mindset at private equity firms, he would.\n\nHe’s a private equity guy who knows what such firms want, and he sees that as enough of a potential challenge for the Celtics to say so publicly — before NBA owners vote to approve the sale.\n\nSixth Street already owns a piece of the San Antonio Spurs and landed a deal for 10% of Major League Baseball’s San Francisco Giants the same week as the Celtics purchase.\n\nA faceless, big-money group owning a sliver of the Celtics may not immediately cause alarm. But we’re witnessing a creeping shift in sports ownership that could have big future implications. Most American pro teams are still owned by individuals, families or investor groups that combine the two. For better or worse, owners are often the faces of their franchises. That’s why their personalities become associated with their teams’ personalities and why fans and journalists hold them personally accountable when their teams stink or there’s some scandal.\n\nEverybody knows Jerry Jones owns the Dallas Cowboys and Robert Kraft owns the New England Patriots. As for the Celtics, outgoing owner Wyc Grousbeck sat in front of cameras himself to announce he was suspending then-Celtics coach Ime Udoka for having a personal relationship with a team employee.\n\nOwners are often the faces of their franchises. That’s why fans hold them personally accountable when their teams stink.\n\nWhen Grousbeck’s group bought the Celtics in 2002, the team was struggling. It hadn’t won a championship in 16 years. Grousbeck will be remembered in Boston for drafting superstars like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and assembling rosters that made it to four NBA Finals and won two championships.\n\nNothing’s to say that private equity owners won’t have similar success, but as Pagliuca must know, such firms are best known for cold-blooded efficiency. We’ve seen them downsize companies however they can: cutting salaries, selling off underperforming units, mass layoffs and holding fire sales on real estate.\n\nDo such firms expect that business model to translate to pro sports, where profits depend on television broadcast contracts, sponsorship deals, revenue sharing and sweetheart arena leases struck with local officials who consider teams civic assets right along with public water infrastructure? Will such investors be as willing to spend up to the NBA’s salary cap or to exceed it with “luxury tax” spending? Might they be even more cutthroat than some individual owners have been about relocating teams if local officials and taxpayers balk at building new stadiums or arenas?\n\nOr will the opposite be true and their billions kick off a spending spree that sends player salaries further into the stratosphere.\n\nAnswers to those questions are forthcoming because private equity ownership of U.S. sports teams is likely to expand. In the case of the San Francisco Giants’ Sixth Street deal, financial details weren’t disclosed, but with the team valued at a reported $4.2 billion, that would mean a $420 million cash infusion to a franchise that plays in a league with no salary cap.\n\nLast year, the NFL, for the first time, approved the sale of as much as 10% of teams’ equity to a list of approved private equity investors, with Sixth Street among them. Last month, the New York Giants’ owners said they’re looking into selling a minority stake, and you can be sure all the approved firms are taking a look.\n\nOne way or another, most sports fans will soon know just how many strings are attached to private equity firms’ purses, and whether they care more about winning and entertaining their fans or squeezing out a profit.",

        "content": "When Donald Trump has an important personnel decision to make, the president too often looks to people he knows personally, as if he were the head of a social club and its members are entitled to certain perks — such as powerful positions in the executive branch of a global superpower.\n\nThis is especially true for the Republican’s former lawyers. Pam Bondi was part of one of Trump’s legal teams, and she’s the attorney general. Todd Blanche was one of his criminal defense attorneys, and he’s now also helping lead the Justice Department. Emil Bove represented Trump before being tapped to serve as the principal associate deputy attorney general. D. John Sauer was also a Trump lawyer, and the president tapped him to serve as the solicitor general.\n\nIn case the list weren’t already long, as NBC News reported, it just got longer.\n\nTrump announced to Truth Social that Alina Habba, who is serving as counselor to the president, will be the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. ... The move is “effective immediately,” Trump said. He said John Giordano, the current interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey, is being nominated as the ambassador to Namibia.\n\nTo be sure, Habba’s work has not been limited to serving as a member of Trump’s legal team. The Republican lawyer — who has no experience as a prosecutor, but who’ll now oversee a federal office with 150 prosecutors — also worked at the pro-Trump Save America PAC, before also working as a campaign spokesperson last year.\n\nBut Habba’s legal work is arguably the most notable part of her recent résumé. It was Habba, for example, who represented Trump in the E. Jean Carroll case, which he lost, and then again in the civil case against the Trump Organization’s civil fraud case, which he also lost.\n\nIn another notable case, Habba helped file a bizarre lawsuit targeting Hillary Clinton and several other Democrats in 2022, which proved so ridiculous that a judge imposed harsh sanctions on Habba for bringing “political grievances masquerading as legal claims” to court.\n\n“This case should never have been brought,” the judge added. “Its inadequacy as a legal claim was evident from the start. No reasonable lawyer would have filed it.”\n\nHabba filed it anyway. It now appears that she’s receiving a reward.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, however, is the degree to which Team Trump is brazenly and shamelessly politicizing federal law enforcement, following years of baseless complaints about Democrats politicizing federal law enforcement. Habba is, if nothing else, a partisan brawler, one who delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention and who appears to revel in attacking Democrats during frequent Fox News appearances.\n\nThe New York Times’ report on Habba’s promotion noted, “U.S. attorneys are traditionally nonpartisan.” Those traditions and norms were thrown out the window as of two months ago.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court’s landmark press freedom ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan is still safe — for now. On Monday, the court declined to review Republican donor Steve Wynn’s petition that asked the justices to overturn the 1964 precedent’s “actual malice” standard, which public figures must meet to bring defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe denial of Wynn’s petition was on the court’s routine order list Monday morning. Ahead of the list’s publication, a clue that the court would reject the petition was that The Associated Press (which Wynn, a casino mogul who reportedly donated more than $1 million to groups that supported Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, wanted to sue) waived its right to even respond to it, and the court didn’t request a response, which it sometimes does when at least one justice thinks it’s warranted.\n\nSo it wasn’t surprising that the court rejected Wynn’s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. What was less clear heading into Monday was whether any of the justices would dissent from the denial. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — two of the court’s six GOP-appointed justices — have previously questioned the Sullivan precedent, but they didn’t do so on Monday. That doesn’t mean their views have changed or that the precedent will stay on the books forever as challenges to it continue. But Wynn’s rejection is the latest evidence that it isn’t immediately at risk at the high court.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "The Trump administration has a high bar in trying to remove the Perkins Coie judge",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Justice Department wants to remove U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell from the Perkins Coie case, after the Obama-appointed judge curbed President Donald Trump’s order targeting the law firm. But as I explained during U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s handling of Trump’s classified documents case, it’s a high bar to remove a judge — so the Trump administration shouldn’t bank on getting rid of Howell.\n\nRecall that the DOJ under then-special counsel Jack Smith didn’t take the step that the DOJ under Trump is taking against Howell. When Smith appealed Cannon’s decision to dismiss Trump’s documents case, outside groups supporting Smith called for her ouster; but the appeals court didn’t rule before Trump won the 2024 election, after which Smith moved to dismiss the case based on DOJ policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\nBut with the DOJ making a motion for Howell’s disqualification, we should get a court ruling on the subject.\n\nAnd what is the Justice Department arguing? From its motion filed Friday, here’s a summary of the government’s position why, in its words, the judge “has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President” in several past cases in addition to the present one:\n\nExamples include this Court enabling the improper efforts of disgraced former prosecutor Jack Smith despite a readily apparent lack of venue in this District; wrongly suggesting in public that President Trump is an authoritarian; and incorrectly finding that President Trump — the most well-known man on Earth — presents a flight risk where even the prior Administration’s Department of Justice had to retract such a suggestion. This Court’s comments at the hearing on the meritless motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) in this case, including gratuitous and biased references by this Court regarding the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller (“Mueller Report”), confirm that reasonable observers may view this Court as incapable of fairly adjudicating these claims against the Commander-In-Chief.\n\nAt the outset, there’s an important distinction to draw between a judge’s rulings and other things such as their outside comments, relationships and the like. That’s because, according to a Supreme Court precedent that the DOJ cites in its disqualification motion, rulings alone “almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.”\n\nTo be sure, the DOJ doesn’t only cite Howell’s rulings. DOJ lawyers pointed to a 2023 speech she gave at a conference in which, they wrote, she “lamented that America is at a ‘crossroads’ and, in an apparent reference to President Trump, indicated that one path would lead to authoritarianism.” They also cited her remark at a hearing in the Perkins Coie case about Trump having “a bee in his bonnet.”\n\nWhen it comes to judicial statements, a party has an even more difficult task when the statements come from the judge’s participation in the relevant legal proceedings, as opposed to from what’s known as an “extrajudicial” source. That subject came up when Trump tried to remove U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan from his other federal criminal case, and she rejected his motion, citing that distinction.\n\nWhile there are distinctions between the situations, it would be surprising if Howell rules differently than Chutkan did when she decides on the motion. Given the high bar for disqualification, if she does in fact deny it, then the Trump DOJ could have a tough time if it presses the matter on appeal.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The exchange didn’t generate a lot of attention, but Donald Trump held a brief Q&A with reporters last week aboard Air Force One, and one journalist reminded the president, “There’s been some criticism that the Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times; they were all during times of war.” The Republican quickly replied, “Well, this is a time of war.”\n\nThat might’ve come as a surprise to many Americans, because, in reality, the United States is not currently engaged in any wars.\n\nThe fact that Trump claimed otherwise dovetailed nicely with a New York Times op-ed from Georgetown University law professor David Cole, who explained that while the White House’s recent violations of civil liberties are “profoundly disturbing,” they’re not unprecedented. Cole explained, however, what’s different about 2025: “Virtually every time previous presidents took such extreme steps, they acted in response to at least a plausible threat to national security. This time, Mr. Trump has invoked emergency powers in the absence of any even plausible emergency.”\n\nIt helps explain why the president said that United States is now in “a time of war”: He needs it to be in order to justify his efforts to curtail civil liberties.\n\nTo that end, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News last week that Venezuelan gang members are “no different than ISIS.” He added, “This is about a wholesale shift on what a terrorist is and how they should be treated in the United States, how they should be treated when they are attacking our soil.”\n\nAs MSNBC’s Chris Hayes recently summarized, “They’re taking all the Bush-Cheney war on terror arguments and applying them to the basic nuts and bolts of immigration policy and enforcement.”\n\nIn case this weren’t quite enough, this “wholesale shift” in how the White House is expanding the definition of “terrorist” also apparently includes those who commit acts of vandalism at Tesla dealerships. “I view these as terrorists,” Trump told reporters on Friday.\n\nTwo days later, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared on Fox News — again — and claimed that some had thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla dealerships, which she believes “could be a weapon of mass destruction.”\n\nTraditionally, officials have reserved the “WMD” label for nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Team Trump, however, appears to be engaged in “a wholesale shift” on what a weapon of mass destruction is, too.\n\nIf you’re thinking this is going to get worse before it gets better, you’re not alone.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 22 episode of “Velshi.”\n\nDictators fear freedom of speech more than any other right because it is the beating heart of a free, democratic society. People who are free to speak are free to challenge authority, share ideas and organize, all of which undermine tyranny. This is why a true measure of a nation’s freedom can be seen in how much dissent it is willing to tolerate — and in a vibrant democracy, dissent is valued, not simply tolerated.\n\nIn the 1700s, the American framers, having recently freed themselves from British rule that suppressed free speech and persecuted dissent, understood the crucial role the First Amendment would play in protecting citizens from government overreach. Benjamin Franklin observed: “Whoever would overthrow the liberty of the nation, must begin by subduing the freedom of speech; a thing terrible to publick traitors.”\n\nA true measure of a nation’s freedom can be seen in how much dissent it is willing to tolerate, and in a vibrant democracy, dissent is valued, not simply tolerated.\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that Donald Trump’s administration has set its sights on America’s universities, institutions that serve as major centers of deliberation and free inquiry, institutions that have historically been principal sites and incubators of dissent and protest. If speech can be effectively chilled in these critical intellectual spaces, it makes it much easier to silence the broader public.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has threatened universities with massive cuts to federal funding if they don’t submit to his agenda, which includes dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning what Trump is calling “illegal protests.”\n\nOn March 10, the administration notified 60 universities that they are under investigation for what it alleges is a failure to protect students from antisemitism on campus and warned the schools they could face “potential enforcement actions” as a result. It comes at a time when there is an active debate on college campuses about what constitutes antisemitism and whether protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza would be included in that definition.\n\nThe Trump administration also announced that it was investigating 52 schools for using what it calls “racial preferences and stereotypes” in their educational programs and activities, essentially a continuation of its attack on DEI initiatives. Last week, the White House announced that it was pausing $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies. And in a move that stunned the academic community nationwide, the Trump administration attempted to exert unprecedented control over Columbia University by threatening to cut $400 million in federal funding unless the school met a long list of demands — among them, placing its Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies under academic receivership for at least five years.\n\nDespite widespread calls from across the academic world urging Columbia to defend its independence, it appears that the university’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, has conceded to Trump’s demands. Armstrong announced several new measures, including a ban on masks to conceal identities, the hiring of 36 campus officers with the authority to arrest students and the appointment of a new senior vice provost to review “programs in regional areas across the University, starting immediately with the Middle East.”\n\nMeanwhile, running parallel to these investigations and threats, the Trump administration has been deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to campuses to seize international students who have no criminal records and are accused of no crimes but who have participated in protests or online criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, their school’s investments in Israel, America’s military support of Israel or the continuing war itself.\n\nTrump’s assault on academia has prompted massive opposition, with growing calls for administrators to resist this assault on academic independence. J Street, a Jewish lobbyist group, issued a statement blasting the administration’s actions: “While Trump will stop at nothing to attack higher education, we remain firm in our belief that universities are a tool for empathy, understanding and academic freedom.\n\n“If the administration was serious about fighting antisemitism,” the statement continues, “it would listen to Jewish students; it would seek to calm campus tensions rather than escalate them; and it might start by throwing out the slew of bigots and conspiracy theorists it has promoted to top positions in its own ranks.”\n\nUniversity presidents, from Wesleyan’s Michael Roth to Princeton’s Christopher Eisgruber, have joined in condemning the administration’s assault on higher education. In The Atlantic, Eisgruber wrote: “The attack on Columbia is a radical threat to scholarly excellence and to America’s leadership in research. Universities and their leaders should speak up and litigate forcefully to protect their rights.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to seize control of academia are part of a broader campaign to neutralize institutions that could potentially threaten his power. From law firms and media outlets to government inspectors general and federal judges, the administration is targeting every major institution that could challenge its agenda.\n\nBut Trump’s threats to cut off funding to some of the world’s premier research universities and deport students are especially alarming because the consequences of this intellectual retreat are not theoretical.\n\nDuring the Red Scare of the early 1950s, the U.S. government expelled hundreds of immigrants, including Chinese students, effectively gifting the Chinese government with trained U.S. scientists and engineers. One of those scientists was Qian Xuesen; today he’s known as the father of China’s ballistic missile program. The odd twist of fate was summed up by Nicholas Sung in Just Security this way: “The very Chinese missiles that threaten Taiwanese and American security are the legacy of the U.S. government’s profiling and deportation of a Chinese scientist.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to seize control of academia are part of a broader campaign to neutralize institutions that could potentially threaten his power.\n\nFormer U.S. Navy Secretary Dan Kimball, who fought to keep Qian in this country, was less polite in his criticism of the calls for the Chinese scientist’s deportation, saying at the time that it was “the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a communist than I was, and we forced him to go.”\n\nQian wasn’t the only victim of the Red Scare. Among its earliest victims was, in fact, the federal workforce. It would eventually sweep up thousands of innocent Americans, destroying careers and reputations. According to historian Beverly Gage: “The anti-Communist surge reshaped every institution in American life: Hollywood, labor unions, churches, universities, elementary schools — and, above all, the national-security state. ... From on high, they told ordinary Americans how to live, whom to love, and what to say.”\n\nToday, a similar pattern is emerging — and make no mistake, MAGA hysteria won’t be confined to America’s campuses. Karen Attiah, a columnist for The Washington Post, warns: “For now, the threat is directed at ‘others’: Palestinians, undocumented immigrants, trans people. ... For this kind of strategy to work, there must be an intentional creation of distance between human beings, the illusion that they are different from us, and that the weapons we throw at them are from a comfortable distance.”\n\nAttiah added: “This distance is and has always been a delusion — a profoundly dangerous weakness that America touts as strength. ... Unless a groundswell of popular resistance moves to meaningfully stop the Trump administration’s targeting of Columbia and students, the rest of America will be considered prey. It is a matter of when, not if.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "NBC News reported this week that President Donald Trump’s administration is thinking about getting rid of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that focuses on HIV prevention and giving those responsibilities to the Department of Health and Human Services. There’s apparently another potential plan, a source told NBC News, that would cut up to $700 million from the CDC’s HIV division.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next. Just how far will any of this go or end? When I was diagnosed, I was prescribed antiretrovirals, and, within months, my viral load dropped to undetectable levels. The virus has remained undetectable since then, and I am now healthy and thriving. I’ve come a long way from the opportunistic infections I was constantly dealing with at the time of my diagnosis.\n\nThen, I was barely insured and terrified that I might never recover. Within months, my insurer rescinded my health insurance policy. How was I going to pay out of pocket for the costly medications I needed to keep me alive?\n\nI soon learned about the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. It provides HIV primary care, treatment and supportive services for low-income people living with HIV. The law provides a safety net that covers the copays for my HIV prescription, which would otherwise cost about $4,000 a month. This is stabilizing for my physical and mental health.\n\nPeople living with HIV work very hard to suppress the virus so that it cannot be detected in our blood because if the virus is undetectable, then it is “untransmittable.” That is, it cannot be passed on to others through sex. In short, treatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nKnowing we cannot expose our partners to HIV and pose no threat to others is affirming and liberating. It allows us to safely have pleasurable relationships with others and make babies.\n\nThe Trump administration has already worked to eliminate USAID and hamper PEPFAR (President Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which is credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003. Now, the CDC may be eliminating funding for HIV prevention or incorporating it into HHS’s Ryan White program. I and others in my community are nervous for the future of HIV treatment and the future of HIV prevention.\n\nTreatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nState and local health departments and community-based nonprofits depend on the CDC’s HIV division for HIV testing, HIV education, funding for the pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, funding and technical support in public health efforts. Removing funding for this could potentially fuel new cases. PrEP, when used correctly, can stop someone from acquiring HIV during intimate encounters.\n\nShoehorning HIV prevention services into the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, which provides HIV care, could overburden the program. Resources to serve the 1.2 million people living with HIV in the U.S. are already stretched thin. Resources can be even scarcer in the Deep South, especially in its rural and urban areas.\n\nAt the same time, House Republicans seem bent on slashing Medicaid.\n\nMany low-income or disabled people living with HIV depend on Medicaid for health care.\n\nI am more concerned than ever about the unraveling of safety nets that wrap around not only people living with HIV but anyone with a chronic health condition. Some days, everything seems under threat.\n\nTrump’s flurry of executive orders against DEI pose a particular danger to people like me, a Black person and member of the LGBTQ community. Many HIV prevention and treatment programs focus on LGBTQ people (sometimes trans people in particular), Black people and women. These programs for treatment and prevention may not be in alignment with Trump’s anti-DEI agenda.\n\nUntil this week, there was not a lot of talk from leaders in the HIV-positive community about preparing people living with HIV for potential service interruptions. In their defense, they didn’t have a crystal ball to predict this, and they have received no guidance from federal funding agencies. Nevertheless, that failure to plan or consider contingencies does not help clients or patients sleep better at night.\n\nWe can see from PEPFAR the consequences of reduced services or zero funding. Millions of lives are affected and rationing of medication and care has started in Africa.\n\nWhen might we need to start to rationing medication or care in the U.S.? I could probably last a couple of months but what then? Being undetectable and healthy is great. We’re living long lives now and getting old.\n\nToo many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nEven though I am trying to remain hopeful that any reshuffling of the CDC or Ryan White will be minimal, I realize hope is not a strategy. Too many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the southwest corner of France and noticed that many of the road signs were turned upside down. I was told farmers did that to protest government policies they opposed.\n\nIt seems to me that now’s the time to turn some things upside down in this country and fight back. We cannot let Trump make HIV a fatal disease again.",

        "content": "The Trump administration’s antagonism toward media outlets that report on its massive and haphazard deportation plans has been a running theme this year.\n\nIn February, I reported on an alarming investigation that right-wing Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr opened into San Francisco radio station KCBS, which shared federal immigration agents’ live locations in connection with a raid in Northern California. And President Donald Trump’s so-called border czar, Tom Homan, has accused the media of putting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents at risk of being “ambushed” as they investigate the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe administration’s angst escalated Friday, with the Justice Department releasing a vague statement announcing that it had opened a criminal investigation into the “selective leak of inaccurate, but nevertheless classified, information from the Intelligence Community relating to Tren de Aragua.”\n\nThe statement then plunges fully into MAGA conspiracism, adding:\n\nWe will not tolerate politically motivated efforts by the Deep State to undercut President Trump’s agenda by leaking false information onto the pages of their allies at the New York Times. The Alien Enemies Proclamation is supported by fact, law, and common sense, which we will establish in court and then expel the TDA terrorists from this country.\n\nLast Thursday — that is, one day prior to the DOJ’s announcement — The New York Times reported that American intelligence agencies had “circulated findings last month that stand starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s claims” that Tren de Aragua was being directed within the United States by Venezuela’s government. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of immigrants to a widely decried prison in El Salvador and has controversially cited the Alien Enemies Act — a wartime law from 1878 that allows for special deportation activities in the event of an invasion — as justification.\n\nThe Justice Department’s statement certainly makes it seem like, above all, the Trump administration is fuming about the legal basis for its cruel immigration policy being undermined.\n\nFor the record: I’ve spoken with legal experts who’ve expressed confusion over the DOJ’s head-scratching claim that the leaks contained “inaccurate, but nevertheless classified, information.” It certainly appears that this investigation is more of a political publicity stunt than it is a legitimate fact-finding mission.",

        "title": "Why Trump’s latest late-night attack on law firms affects us all",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It was late Friday night, the day after his triumph over legal juggernaut Paul Weiss, that President Donald Trump issued his latest broadside against law firms.\n\nYou would be forgiven for missing it given the timing of its release. But it's worth paying attention to — as some lawyers in your life or on your screens are likely making clear by now.\n\nFirst, let me clear up what this latest attack even entails. It began with Trump issuing executive actions punishing three firms — Covington & Burling, which did not react; Perkins Coie, which fought back and won a partial temporary restraining order; and Paul Weiss, which ultimately capitulated to a deal announced last Thursday, the terms of which are still a matter of some debate. But the president has now directed Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a memo issued Friday night, to seek sanctions “against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.\"\n\nOther law firms are running scared — and lawyers I know are furious.\n\nIn the memo, Trump directed Bondi to do whatever is appropriate “to refer for disciplinary action any attorney whose conduct in Federal court or before any component of the Federal Government appears to violate professional conduct rules, including rules governing meritorious claims and contentions, and particularly in cases that implicate national security, homeland security, public safety, or election integrity.” And where she determines that conduct by a lawyer or law firm warrants sanctions or disciplinary action or where, based on her review of litigation against the federal government over the last eight years, she discovers “fraudulent” or “vexatious” litigation conduct, Trump directed her to recommend “additional steps that may be taken,” including the same suspension of security clearances or termination of contracts with the federal government that constituted the heart of his three earlier, law-firm specific executive orders.\n\nYes, some of Trump’s executive actions, as aimed at lawyers, seem to be purely performative. Revoking the security clearances of lawyers he has long complained about sounds punitive — until you realize this is the second time he has done it with respect to some of them. What's more, some of his allies concede that taking those clearances away for people like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James is more symbolic than substantive.\n\nSimilarly, directing the Justice Department to seek bonds — essentially asking the court to make a plaintiff post a security deposit of sorts — every time a plaintiff wants a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order against his administration? Scary in theory, but hardly so in practice, where judges control whether plaintiffs have to post any security, let alone a prohibitively expensive one that would deter litigation.\n\nBut the Friday night memo? Trump knows that his attacks on judges — who collectively have issued more than a dozen nationwide injunctions against his policies since his return to the White House — might be popular with his base, but aren’t exactly changing judicial behavior. Moreover, while judges decide cases, lawyers make them. And therefore once Paul Weiss offered Trump major concessions in exchange for the revocation of his executive action targeting the firm, other law firms are running scared — and lawyers I know are furious.\n\nPart of what explains their disgust is what Paul Weiss represents in the firmament of law firms. It is a longtime affiliate of progressive organizations, a reliable home for former Democratic political appointees, and historically, a champion of various civil rights causes. And, as The New York Times has observed, it has been led for nearly two decades by one of the legal profession’s most prominent Democratic donors and organizers, Brad Karp.\n\nIndeed, Karp's colleagues have included former partner Mark Pomerantz — who memorialized his pursuit of Trump's indictment by the Manhattan DA in a revealing book — and multiple former Democratic government officials who are current partners, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.\n\nIf Karp — aided by this generation’s GOP superlawyer, Bill Burck — was so eager to cut a deal (and one that included a commitment to eliminating all DEI practices and policies, according to Trump), what hope is there for the rest of Big Law?\n\nJudges have the power to declare what the law is and is not, but they can’t rule on cases that are never brought.\n\nTo be clear, the fear I hear is not about the topics that usually make law firms anxious. They’re not worried principally about average profits per partner (which at Paul Weiss has topped $7.5 million on the most recent reporting) or client retention. What worries them is how the Trump administration’s increasing disregard for the law can be contained if firms sideline themselves from the fight.\n\nAs one law firm partner reminded me, lawyers take for granted what most nonlawyers don’t understand: Judges have the power to declare what the law is and is not, but they can’t rule on cases that are never brought. And if law firms believe they’ll be investigated, or worse, simply for bringing cases that Trump considers frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith, they won’t bring them.\n\nThat’s OK, you might think. That’s what groups like the American Civil Liberties Union or Democracy Forward are for: to wage the major constitutional battles. But those groups and other so-called impact litigation groups have long partnered with law firms — and many of the landmark cases that even nonlawyers know by name have been law firm-led.\n\nTake the battle for marriage equality. The watershed case of Obergefell v. Hodges? Argued by Ropes & Gray partner Howard Hallward-Driemeyer. Some years earlier, United States v. Windsor declared that a federal statute refusing to recognize same-sex marriages was invalid. And who shepherded that case to and through the Supreme Court? Then-Paul Weiss partner Roberta Kaplan.\n\nOf course, then, as now, it is more common to hear public disdain of lawyers than it is to sing their praises. Even Shakespeare, in “Henry VI,” threw in a line that reeks of present-day schadenfreude: “The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers!” But 30 years ago, in a dissent, then-Justice John Paul Stevens reminded us that that line was “spoken by a rebel, not a friend of liberty.” Shakespeare, Stevens observed, “insightfully realized that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government.”\n\nThe question is: Will we?",

        "title": "Usha Vance surely knows what she’s doing by going to Greenland right now",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Second lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland on Thursday, the White House announced, as part of a diplomatic trip to the massive frozen island. By going to a country that President Donald Trump has said he wants to buy or forcibly take, Vance’s visit will put her in the middle of one of the Trump administration’s least diplomatic acts of diplomacy, making it even harder to deny Trump’s blatant bullying.\n\nVance, who has kept a low profile since her husband, JD Vance, was sworn in as vice president, will be joined by one of the couple’s two sons. She said in an Instagram video that she’s especially looking forward to attending the country’s national dogsled race. “I’m also coming to celebrate the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between our two nations,” she added, “and to express hope that our relationship will only grow stronger in the coming years.”\n\nHer mild words do little to paper over the current tensions between the U.S. and Greenland. Trump has been clear that he hopes to acquire the island from Denmark, reportedly at least in part because of how huge it appears on the most common map projection. He’s also hinted that it should be acquired for vague national security reasons or to obtain the minerals under its permafrost. Neither Greenland nor Denmark has been particularly enthusiastic about by Trump’s remarks, even less so after Trump hinted that, if it were not put up for sale, he could take Greenland by force or economic leverage.\n\nBefore Vance’s trip commences, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz (the one who reportedly invited The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief into a Signal group where top secret military plans were shared) will also visit Greenland this week. According to The New York Times, Wright and Waltz will tour Pituffik Space Base, America’s northernmost military outpost.\n\nIt feels ridiculously unnecessary for Vance to be dragged into this mess as the soft power side of what’s clearly a good cop-bad cop routine. But, then again, the vice presidency has long been regarded as one of the least consequential roles in Washington. By the transitive property alone, the role of the vice president’s spouse must be up there as far as gigs go. Second ladies (or, as of recently, gentlemen) haven’t accumulated the same sort of cache as cultural icons that first ladies have, but that still doesn’t help explain the odd choice of Vance’s first solo destination.\n\nI can’t imagine that Greenland was at the top of Vance’s list of places she wanted to travel as second lady\n\nPoliticians in Greenland are ripping apart Vance’s rationale for traveling to Greenland. The country recently held parliamentary elections in which two parties that want independence from Denmark took the top spots. Neither party holds enough seats to claim a majority, and talks to form a new government are ongoing.\n\nNotably, the smaller party has had warm words for the Trump administration, but there’s been little support from the larger public regarding Trump’s overtures. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, head of the larger party in the potential coalition, told the Times, “The fact that the Americans are well aware we are in the middle of negotiations once again shows a lack of respect for the Greenlandic people.”\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Múte Egede called Vance’s visit a “highly aggressive” attempt to influence the new government and said that “it can in no way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician’s wife.” Egede said, “What is the security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”\n\nWho knows? Maybe Vance really did want to visit Greenland to watch a dog race with her kid. Maybe she got recruited to go simply as a boost to Waltz and Wright’s trip. Whichever it is, Vance is no rube. She’s highly accomplished and sophisticated; that is, she’s smart enough to know that her trip signals support for Trump’s ambitions toward Greenland. She could have declined to go if she didn’t want to send that message.\n\nNo offense to the Greenlandic people, but I can’t imagine that Greenland was at the top of Vance’s list of places she wanted to travel as second lady. Greenland knows why she’s there, and her trip likely won’t do anything to foster the “mutual respect and cooperation” she touts in her video.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "During Donald Trump’s presidential transition process, there were plenty of rumors that billionaire Howard Lutnick was well positioned to lead the Treasury Department — one of the most sought-after positions in any White House Cabinet. The Associated Press reported that Elon Musk, among others, even lobbied on his behalf.\n\nThose efforts ultimately fell short, and Trump tapped Lutnick to serve as the commerce secretary. As for why, exactly, he didn’t get a more prominent position, The Bulwark reported two weeks after Election Day that Lutnick kept “shooting himself in the foot” by making needlessly provocative public comments that annoyed the incoming Republican team. The report quoted a Trump adviser who said Lutnick needed to learn how to “shut the f--- up.”\n\nFour months later, the same problem persists. Lutnick announced that the president was preparing to waive taxes on Americans earning under $150,000 per year, only to walk that back soon after. He urged a national television audience to buy stock in Tesla, sparking an ethics controversy the White House struggled to defend.\n\nCommon sense might’ve suggested that Lutnick would start avoiding microphones for a while, but instead, as USA Today reported, he made matters vastly worse.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested this week that only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check — but honest people like his mother would simply live with the fact that the government didn’t mail their monthly payment.\n\nDuring an appearance on a conservative podcast, the billionaire said, “Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain. She just wouldn’t. She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining.”\n\nIn case that wasn’t quite enough, Trump’s commerce secretary added that he and his colleagues know the “easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen.”\n\nBillionaires like Lutnick might not understand this, but for millions of struggling Americans, Social Security benefits are a critically important lifeline. A missing check for a month would mean they couldn’t buy groceries.\n\nWhen those folks call to complain about a Social Security check that didn’t arrive, it doesn’t mean they’re criminals. It means they’re hungry.\n\nIn a healthier political environment, out-of-touch nonsense like this would almost certainly lead to an unpleasant phone call in which the president urged his commerce secretary to choose a new career path.\n\nBut stepping back, there’s also a larger context to this. While Lutnick spoke publicly about a hypothetical scenario in which the Social Security Administration didn’t send checks for a month, the Trump administration’s acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration raised the prospect of shutting down the system that undergirds the agency, though he backtracked soon after.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the Trump administration also announced plans to slash the Social Security Administration’s workforce, while simultaneously forcing more Social Security beneficiaries to make in-person appearances at local offices that will have fewer employees.\n\nMartin O’Malley, who served as the Social Security commissioner in the Biden administration, appeared on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Friday night and said Trump administration officials had already taken 90% of the actions necessary to “crater” the agency. The former Democratic governor added that Americans “should be outraged.\n\nThe Washington Post published a much-discussed report the day after Christmas that highlighted the perspectives of several low-income voters who supported the Trump ticket in the 2024 elections. The article specifically referenced a middle-aged Pennsylvania woman who struggles to make ends meet despite receiving food stamps and Social Security benefits, who explained why she voted for the Republican ticket.\n\n“[Trump] is more attuned to the needs of everyone instead of just the rich,” the woman told the Post. “I think he knows it’s the poor people that got him elected, so I think Trump is going to do more to help us.”\n\nI wonder what her reaction was to Lutnick’s comments.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 23 episode of \"Velshi.\"\n\nWhen Donald Trump entered office for the first time, he was quickly met with the so-called Resistance: On Jan. 21, 2017, one day after his inauguration, millions across the United States participated in the Women’s March, a protest against basically everything that Trump stood for.\n\nNow fast forward eight years to the weekend before Trump’s second inauguration. This time, the Women’s March had become the People’s March, and the turnout was much smaller and the effort a lot more modest. The muted response in the months between Election Day and Inauguration Day had many disappointed and frightened Americans wondering if their fellow citizens just felt too defeated and impotent. Maybe they were too scared to join a protest as a wannabe authoritarian returned to power, one who promised to shut down dissent and exact revenge against his political opponents.\n\nWe’re seeing a different kind of movement building right now, one that has had steady and sustained momentum.\n\nBut as the second Trump administration quickly got down to business — and enlisted the president's top campaign donor, Elon Musk, to help gut the civil service — Americans perked up. People began contacting their representatives. There were reports that some Congress members’ phone lines were ringing nonstop and their voicemail boxes were full. Across the country, people held protests in support of federal workers, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, veterans, scientists, the environment, the people of Ukraine, and the people of Gaza, and the list goes on and on and on.\n\nMany people have also turned up at town halls, especially those held by Republicans, to voice their anger and distress about what this administration is doing and the lack of pushback from Congress. On Friday, longtime Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa was booed by his constituents at a town hall. Many members of my immediate family have either run for or held elected office, so I know from experience that town halls aren’t typically so well-attended. You’d be lucky to fill half the seats in the room. But Grassley’s town hall was packed, and that’s been the case for many other town halls recently, both for Republicans and Democrats.\n\nOn Thursday, roughly 2,000 people reportedly showed up for a town hall hosted by Democrat Rep. Kelly Morrison of Minnesota. The state’s governor, Tim Walz, held a town hall of his own that reportedly had more than 1,500 attendees. In California, about 1,000 reportedly came out for Democratic Rep. Salud Carbajal’s town hall.\n\nRepublicans have faced such tough questions and sharp criticisms at their events — you’ve probably seen some of it go viral online — that GOP leadership has told its members to just stop doing town halls altogether. To counter that, some progressive groups have hosted “empty chair town halls.” People schedule these events and invite their representatives, and if the representatives don’t show up, the constituents voice their concerns to each other and to an empty chair that represents their member of Congress.\n\nSo while we haven’t seen a demonstration on the same scale as the 2017 Women’s March, something is happening. We’re seeing a different kind of movement building right now, one that has had steady and sustained momentum — and it's a movement that may change the political landscape as well, as many Americans look for leaders who will show up to fight for and with them.\n\nNobody understands this better than Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two progressive icons who have been pushing Democrats and the left to pursue a new path forward. In recent days, the pair have embarked on a tour called “Fighting Oligarchy,” and the turnout has been tremendous: 25,000 people were expected to attend their rally in Denver on Friday but, according to Sanders’ team, 34,000 people showed up — the largest rally of his career. It was also the largest in Denver since Barack Obama held a rally there in 2008. Another 23,000 people reportedly attended their stop in Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday, and 15,000 reportedly turned out in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nJust think about that for a second: Tens of thousands of people are showing up for political rallies, and the midterms are still more than a year and a half away. That’s unheard of, and it cannot be overlooked.",

When the president and his team sent non-criminals to a prison in El Salvador while falsely claiming that they were gang members, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem.\n\nWhen Team Trump’s DOGE operation repeatedly stepped on its own tail, including an instance in which it confused $8 billion and $8 million, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem. When the White House royally screwed up its Office of Management and Budget spending “freeze” memo, it was a reminder that this White House has a competence problem.\n\nBut to fully appreciate the truly galactic nature of Team Trump’s competence problem, one must read — and then re-read — the latest report from Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nIn a story so ridiculous that it almost defies description, much of the Trump administration’s national security team — Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House national security adviser Michael Waltz — organized a meeting to discuss plans for a military strike.\n\nThat might not sound especially notable, but these powerful officials didn’t meet to discuss an active military operation in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, where phones are not permitted. Rather, they help their chat by way of a Signal thread — and they inadvertently invited a journalist to participate.\n\nNo, seriously, that’s what happened.\n\nThe Atlantic’s editor-in-chief acknowledged that as this was happening, he was skeptical that the chat was authentic, which was understandable given the circumstances. But it was quite real, as confirmed by a spokesperson for the National Security Council. (When Goldberg came to realize that he was actually participating in in a chat involving high-ranking officials discussing a military operation, he exited.)\n\nTrying to summarize the reporting is difficult — please believe me when I tell you that it’s important to read the whole thing — and it’s challenging to know where to start. Indeed, the list of questions is not short. Did these officials break the law? Was this the first time they used a private chat for this purpose, or is this a routine practice in the Trump White House? How many of these people will be asked to resign in the wake of this humiliating debacle? How many will be fired?\n\nDo these guys always write as if they’re over-caffeinated middle schoolers playing video games? (Kevin Kruse, a historian at Princeton University, wrote in response to the reporting, “In private, these people seem immensely stupid.”) Do they remember what they said about Hillary Clinton, who was accused of using a private platform to discuss sensitive national security matter?\n\nBut as the political world comes to terms with the scope and scale of this genuine scandal, I’m stuck on the fact that the White House’s breathtaking incompetence appears to be undermining the national security of the United States in terrifying ways. Americans’ safety is in the hands of unqualified and inexperienced amateurs, who clumsily invited a journalist to join a chat about a military strike in a foreign country.\n\nFor his part, a reporter asked Donald Trump for his reaction to the revelations, just hours after The Atlantic published its report online. “I don’t know anything about it,” the president said. After taking a few rhetorical shots at the magazine, he again added: “I know nothing about it.”\n\nThat doesn’t make matters any better, given that he really ought to know something about it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Columbia University caved. After the Trump administration cut off $400 million in federal funding based on the claim that the university had failed to protect Jewish students from harassment during pro-Palestinian protests last year, the university has agreed to a series of demands that will make major changes to the university’s core functions, including the way it handles admissions, security and academic inquiry.\n\nTrump appears to view Columbia as a guinea pig for trying to limit free expression of ideas on college campuses.\n\nIf anyone were somehow still under the illusion that the MAGA right champions free speech, this may be the clearest example yet that President Donald Trump is in reality one of the country's greatest enemies of free speech. Strong-arming Columbia University is an affront to the First Amendment. And at a time of rising authoritarianism, Columbia’s concessions should be setting off sirens about the repression of free speech on campuses, one of the most essential spaces for dissent in American life.\n\nMy colleague Clarissa Jan-Lim summarized the concessions so far:\n\nIn a memo issued Friday afternoon, the university said it will ban face masks “for the purpose of concealing one’s identity”; hire 36 “special officers” empowered to arrest students and remove them from campus; appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; adopt a formal definition of antisemitism; review its admission procedures to ensure those processes are “unbiased”; and commit to “greater institutional neutrality” — most of which address demands from the Trump administration.\n\nNotably, Columbia has declined to pursue legal challenges to Trump’s suppression agenda and decided to go along with many of its suggestions (some of which it was reportedly considering on its own).\n\nOne thing must be clear: Trump’s demands aren’t about protecting Jewish students from bigotry. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp writes, Trump is at the forefront of the pro-Israel, antisemitic right. Our president has posted antisemitic memes, dined with Holocaust-deniers, declared that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer isn’t Jewish and allied with militants who traffic in antisemitic ideology. He leads a movement brimming with antisemitic sentiment, and his movement’s theories of society and power rely on antisemitic tropes.\n\nAnd while there were reports of antisemitic conduct on Columbia’s campus last year, Trump has failed to demonstrate why those episodes warrant something so radical as ruining the university financially instead of letting the university deal with the issue on its own, as it already has been. As a group of legal scholars at Columbia University have pointed out in an article, Trump’s claims that Columbia violated provisions of the Civil Rights Act protecting Jewish students entail “no explanation of the alleged violations, no mention of a completed investigation, and no account of how Columbia has been deliberately indifferent to ongoing antisemitic discrimination or harassment on its campus — perhaps because any such account would be implausible at this time. There is therefore no apparent statutory basis for a funding cutoff.”\n\nA pro-Palestine rally at Columbia University in New York City in 2024. David Dee Delgado / Getty Images file\n\nTrump appears to view Columbia as a guinea pig for trying to limit free expression of ideas on college campuses. The new policing policies are likely to make students more afraid of expressing dissent on campus. They signal a radically punitive attitude toward the kind of spirited free expression that has long defined the political power of student movements. And after ICE conducted raids on Columbia’s property and the university harshly punished students who occupied buildings to express their support for Palestinians last year, it’s likely that many students at Columbia and elsewhere will hold their tongues rather than express their views of justice.\n\nTrump also appears to be trying to limit academic freedom. As The Wall Street Journal points out, while the academic changes to the university’s Middle East department aren’t formally being described as a receivership, “the changes align with what usually happens in a receivership.” The new senior vice provost, per the newspaper, is meant to “ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced.” It’s unclear what “balanced” means, but in the context of Trump’s broader aims it reads as an euphemism for pushing curricula and instruction to the political right. As Amherst political scientist Austin Sarat wrote in a recent column for MSNBC about Trump’s demands of Columbia, “One can (almost) admire the Trump administration’s ingenuity in using receivership as a smoke screen for censorship.”\n\nAccording to Reuters, Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors, called Trump’s demands “arguably the greatest incursion into academic freedom, freedom of speech and institutional autonomy that we’ve seen since the McCarthy era.” He added,​​ “I know every academic faculty member in this country is angry about Columbia University’s inability to stand up to a bully.”\n\nAcademia has long been a lifeblood of the left in America, the site of some of the most influential intellectual and political resistance to injustices in American society and politics. Trump is trying to put a muzzle on that resistance — before it even fully takes shape — as swiftly and aggressively as he can. It’s frightening that Columbia is helping Trump strap the muzzle on.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Several conservative organizations asked the Federal Communications Commission last week to end its investigation into CBS over a seemingly baseless complaint that the network wrongly altered an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has accused “60 Minutes” of running defense for the Harris campaign with selective editing. CBS has denied the allegation, and it said earlier this month that the complaint, brought by the conservative nonprofit Center for American Rights, “punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.” (It’s worth noting that Fox News edited some of its footage to shorten Trump’s rambling, false answers during a campaign Q&A event in October.)\n\nThe CBS complaint was dismissed in January by then-outgoing FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who warned the complaints sought to \"weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.” But Trump’s handpicked FCC chairman, Project 2025 co-author Brendan Carr, revived the complaint when he was tapped for the post — and now some conservatives seem to be in line with Carr’s predecessor in thinking the complaint should be dropped.\n\nAs Reuters reported Thursday:\n\nThe Center for Individual Freedom, Americans for Tax Reform, Taxpayers Protection Alliance and other groups called on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to end the investigation into the unit of Paramount Global, saying an “adverse ruling against CBS would constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs.”\n\nAlthough the request puts the groups at odds with Carr, it still includes some MAGA talking points. For example, the groups say they “understand and appreciate why many conservatives would seek to now ‘level the playing field’ and subject other media organizations — such as CBS’s parent company Paramount — to the same regulatory cudgel that has long afflicted conservative media.”\n\nBut the message was clear: These groups are fearful of the Trump administration taking action against CBS in this case (perhaps because they, too, see the baselessness in it) and don’t want conservative media outlets to be on the receiving end of such treatment if and when the executive branch is controlled by the Democratic Party again.\n\nCarr, for the record, doesn’t appear to share their worries. In a statement to Reuters, he vowed to continue this illiberal stunt.\n\n“The FCC’s review of the complaint against CBS remains active and ongoing,” he told Reuters. Ever since he was appointed, Carr has treated his position as a weapon to be wielded in Trump's war against the free press. He opened investigations into NPR and PBS, two media outlets reviled by Republicans. And just last week, he threatened to kill corporate mergers involving companies that have policies promoting diversity.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "At an Oval Office event on Friday, Donald Trump was asked about his administration using the Alien Enemies Act to fly some non-criminals to a prison in El Salvador. “I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process,” the president replied.\n\nFor now, let’s put aside the fact that there’s an enormous difference between a vetting process and due process. For that matter, let’s also stick a pin in the very important conversation about the nature of the administration’s “very strong” vetting process and the degree to which it appears to have failed.\n\nWhat also stood out for me about Trump’s answer, however, was the fact that he seemed to put some distance between himself and his policy. Instead of simply declaring that the White House did everything right, he said he was “told” — by whom, he didn’t say — that the process had merit.\n\nHours later, during a separate Q&A with reporters, the president went even further down the same road and suggested that he didn’t actually sign his own order invoking the Alien Enemies Act. NBC News reported:\n\nTrump appeared to indicate [Friday] that he did not sign a proclamation last week that invoked the Alien Enemies Act his administration used to justify recent deportation flights that have since sparked an intense court fight. He made the remark after being asked about a federal judge’s concerns about his use of the wartime law to deport Venezuelan immigrants despite being ordered not to.\n\nIn his unscripted comments, the president told reporters, “I don’t know when it was signed, because I didn’t sign it. Other people handled it.” The president then praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying, “He wanted them out, and we go along with that. We want to get criminals out of our country.”\n\nPressed for some kind of explanation, the White House later told CNN that Trump “was obviously referring to the original Alien Enemies Act that was signed back in 1798.”\n\nGiven the context, that was literally unbelievable. The exchange, which was on camera, clearly provided the necessary context: He was asked about the ongoing court case and the way in which his order was implemented.\n\nThe idea that Trump was saying he “didn’t sign” a federal law 227 years ago is plainly ridiculous.\n\nBut the fact that the president made these comments raised a variety of related questions. If, as Trump put it, he “didn’t sign” his own directive, why did the White House say he did? Did he use an autopen? Does the president, who routinely questions his immediate predecessor’s mental acuity, not remember the historically significant order he ostensibly signed a week earlier?\n\nA Washington Post analysis asked a variety of related questions: “So what did happen? Did Trump misspeak? Is he trying to deflect responsibility for a decision under heavy legal scrutiny by suggesting he was merely following through on an idea proposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio? And if he didn’t sign it, who — or what — did?”\n\nI don’t imagine we’ve heard the last of this one.",

        "content": "In 2003, when I first walked through the doors of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), one of the first things I noticed was the wall of fallen heroes, RFE/RL journalists murdered for simply reporting the truth. Their names and photos were a chilling reminder that this wasn’t just a job. It was a mission.\n\nBefore then, I’d already reported from some of the world’s most dangerous places, most recently as the Afghanistan bureau chief for the Turkish news agency IHA. But nothing prepared me for that moment in September 2006 when I sat at my desk, and the editor on duty announced: “We are leading today’s news hour with the killing of Ogulsapar Muradova.”\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was the wall of fallen heroes, RFE/RL journalists murdered for simply reporting the truth.\n\nMuradova, RFE/RL’s correspondent in Turkmenistan, had been arrested there weeks before. Her family was later told to collect her body—bruised, battered and bearing the unmistakable signs of torture. There was no autopsy. No court case. No justice.\n\nHer crime? Reporting the news.\n\nOn March 15, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) terminated RFE/RL’s federal funding grant, along with that of its sister organization, Radio Free Asia, and placed the vast majority of Voice of America staff on administrative leave—effectively gutting the organization and silencing its work. The justification? Cost-cutting.\n\nBut this isn’t just a budget cut. In the words of RFE/RL President Stephen Capus, “It would be a massive gift to America’s enemies, the dictators” who have spent decades trying—and failing—to silence RFE/RL.\n\nFor nearly 75 years, RFE/RL has been a voice for those silenced by their own governments, from the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc to today’s authoritarian regimes in Central Asia, Russia, Iran and beyond. It has exposed corruption, countered disinformation and provided a rare platform for citizens to speak out in places where doing so can mean prison—or worse.\n\nDuring Tajikistan’s civil war, RFE/RL’s Tajik service, Radio Ozodi, became the country’s most trusted news source. When the Turkmen government outright banned the word “COVID-19” during the pandemic, RFE/RL was the only source telling the truth about the virus.\n\nAcross its broadcast region, RFE/RL’s investigative work has led to real change: schools suddenly repaired, electricity restored, health crises averted, officials forced to act on citizen complaints—simply because RFE/RL exposed their failures.\n\nRFE/RL’s investigative work has led to real change: schools suddenly repaired, electricity restored, health crises averted, officials forced to act on citizen complaints.\n\nThough despised by those in power, our words were impossible to ignore. During my time as director of RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service, Azatlyk, it was widely known that transcripts of our daily broadcasts reached the president’s desk.\n\nThat is the power of free media. That is the power the U.S. government is now poised to destroy.\n\nThe U.S. will save $142 million per year cutting RFE/RL —less than the price of a single F-35A fighter jet.\n\nElon Musk called for the shutdown of U.S.-funded media, including RFE/RL, in a February post on X. That paved the way for its downfall. Last year, Musk’s company SpaceX launched 138 Falcon 9 rockets. RFE/RL’s annual budget of $142 million costs less than two Falcon 9 flights. And unlike billion-dollar space tourism ventures, which benefit a handful of billionaires, RFE/RL serves 47.4 million people every week\n\nFrom Moscow to Beijing, Tehran to Kabul, authoritarian regimes have long understood that their greatest threat is not foreign armies, but free information. That’s why they have jailed, tortured and murdered journalists. That’s why they have expelled foreign media, banned independent outlets and built firewalls to block the truth from reaching the people.\n\nAnd now, instead of continuing to promote free information and democracy, America is handing those authoritarian regimes exactly what they want.\n\nSince the Cold War, RFE/RL has been America’s most powerful soft power tool, a direct challenge to the lies and propaganda of authoritarian states. As Natan Sharansky and other former prisoners of communism have testified, RFE/RL was a source of hope, a reminder that America had not forgotten them.\n\nToday, that mission is as urgent as ever.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has turned state media into an engine of military propaganda. China’s influence operations have expanded across Asia, Africa and Europe. The Taliban runs Afghanistan’s airwaves. Iran censors the internet and jails dissenters. And yet, as authoritarianism rises, America is retreating from the fight.\n\nThe void left by RFE/RL’s shutdown won’t remain empty for long.\n\nWill it be filled by independent journalism? No.\n\nThe void left by RFE/RL’s shutdown won’t remain empty for long.\n\nIt will be filled by Russian disinformation. By Chinese Communist Party propaganda. By Iranian state-controlled outlets spewing anti-Western rhetoric. By the Taliban’s “Mullah Radio.”\n\nThis decision not only weakens America’s influence; it actively undermines President Trump’s own stated policy goals on free speech. It contradicts everything the U.S. has claimed to stand for: freedom of the press, support for democracy and a commitment to human rights.\n\nAnd for what? To save a fraction of a fraction of the federal budget?\n\nAs these broadcasts go silent, I think of the journalists who risked everything to report for RFE/RL. Many are still in prison, their futures uncertain.

It’s about America’s commitment to the truth, to freedom, to the very ideals it once championed on the global stage.\n\nIf this administration allows RFE/RL to die, it will not just be a mistake of phenomenal proportion, but it will also be a historic abdication of America’s role in the world.\n\nAnd the cost will be paid by millions who are left voiceless.",

        "title": "Trump’s promise to preserve Social Security may not survive DOGE",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has said multiple times that he has no plans to cut Social Security. That suggests he understands the old political axiom that Social Security is the third rail in American politics. Touch it and get torched.\n\nBut we see something different in his administration’s actions. The marauding DOGE brigade has taken an ax to the bedrock program with staff cuts, leadership changes and office closures, and it has recently announced a new policy that would reduce the opportunities for people to conduct Social Security business over the phone. Even Republicans who have supported Trump have expressed concern about the downsizing efforts and the caustic rhetoric that could undermine public trust in the nation’s largest federal program and hurt their senior and disabled constituents who rely on Social Security.\n\nSocial Security is the third rail in American politics. Touch it and get torched.\n\nThere’s a long list of reasons we can’t fully trust this administration’s stewardship over the Social Security Administration, but let’s start with the following six signs.\n\nThe top reason is obvious. The administration needs to make big cuts to fulfill Elon Musk’s promise to trim 20% from the federal budget of $6.8 trillion and extend tax cuts for wealthy people. It’s impossible to make good on that promise without raiding programs that have heretofore been politically untouchable. Musk’s chainsaw approach — including shuttering offices and slashing federal staffing — is not gonna get to that 20% mark. The Social Security Administration paid $120 billion in benefits to more than 67 million people in 2024, providing benefits to elderly people, disabled people and dependents.\n\nReason No. 2: Musk and other DOGE leaders don’t understand how Social Security works. SSA employees have reported that the new DOGE-approved leadership team has shown little interest in learning about the inner workings of the massive and massively complicated agency, and Musk has wrongly disparaged it as a “Ponzi scheme.”\n\nThat rhetoric leads to the third reason on this list. This administration seems to care little about the American public or the government’s public servants. You see that in the way it has gutted federal departments and fired hundreds of people with little empathy for their plight. You see that in the closure of field offices and the scaling back of help lines with seemingly no regard for how elderly or disabled recipients or beneficiaries will get help. And you certainly saw it in the cavalier comments from billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said his mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if the Social Security Administration failed to send her check.\n\n“She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month,” Lutnick said on the “All-In Podcast.” Pushing the false narrative that fraud is rampant among those receiving Social Security payments, Lutnick went on to say that “the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen.”\n\nWhoever screams, he said, are the people who’re stealing. I think it’s safe to say that very few people, regardless of their political affiliations, would be quiet if their Social Security payments didn’t arrive.\n\nClocking in at No. 4: Its laser focus on eradicating DEI notwithstanding, the Trump administration either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about our country’s changing demographics. While Trump has appointed more women to his Cabinet than any other Republican president, his Cabinet doesn’t mirror the demographics of the country in terms of race, veteran’s status or ethnicity — but especially not in terms of income and wealth.\n\nBiden’s Cabinet was collectively worth $118 million; in January, the members of Trump’s Cabinet were collectively worth more than $460 billion.\n\nPublic Citizen reports that President Joe Biden’s Cabinet was collectively worth $118 million; in January, the members of Trump’s Cabinet were collectively worth more than $460 billion. The average salary in the U.S. is $66,621 according to the SSA’s national wage index.\n\nThe DOGE team’s buzz saw approach to Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare is where the administration’s disinterest in demographics is particularly glaring. By the end of this year, almost 12,000 people in the U.S. will be turning 65 daily as all those Baby Boomers stampede into retirement. Social Security staffing was already at a 50-year low, and the administration plans to further cut 7,000 workers, or almost 12% of the staff.\n\nA fifth reason Social Security is likely to continue to go through the DOGE wringer is its vast trove of sensitive information. Data holds value — especially in the world of technology, where software and apps are constantly scooping up personal information. The Social Security Administration touches almost every working American in some way, and SSA employees have traditionally taken strict steps to protect all that data. Access is limited even within the administration’s various departments, and SSA employees annually take an oath to protect that information. Even inadvertently disclosing data could result in a five-year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine for every violation, Laura Haltzel, former associate commissioner at the SSA, said on the podcast “You Earned This.”\n\nThere’s no evidence that DOGE marauders who swept into the Social Security Administration allegedly looking for waste, abuse and fraud signed a similar oath or that they consider Americans’ data sacred.\n\n“The magnitude of the data that is being shared through DOGE is so much bigger than probably most people even realize,” Haltzel said.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration conflates need with weakness and associates wealth with strength. Musk seems to view the program as excessive largesse and not money people have earned. Yes, earned with FICA payroll tax deductions that have been taken out of their paychecks every week with the full expectation that they would get some assistance in their elderly years. (FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act — and those deductions earn future credits for Social Security benefits.)\n\nSocial Security is a social contract that has worked in this country for 90 years, and while the billionaire class has no need to pay attention to the FICA deduction in paychecks, voters in both red and blue America will indeed notice if their Social Security payments don’t appear. They will complain. It will be loud. And it will be justified.\n\nAbout one-quarter of the aged live in households that receive at least 90% of family income from Social Security.\n\nTo say it is a lifeline is not an understatement. According to a 2017 report from the Social Security Administration, “roughly half of the aged population live in households that receive at least 50 percent of total family income from Social Security and about one-quarter of the aged live in households that receive at least 90 percent of family income from Social Security.”\n\nIf Trump breaks his promise to protect Social Security, that’s devastatingly bad news for America. Social Security is an anti-poverty program, and ending it or even severely curtailing it would have catastrophic effects.\n\nSocial Security is called a third rail for a reason. And if Trump and his billionaire aids touch it they’ll give Democrats the issue they need to wage a righteous fight on behalf of all Americans.",

While nearly 500,000 federal workers live in Washington, D.C., Maryland or Virginia, Indeed’s data shows that 80% of active federal worker profiles are tied to locations elsewhere. Nearly a third of those workers are in the South, excluding D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThey also tend to be more educated, potentially increasing competition in an already tough job market.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces mounting pressure from President Donald Trump and some of his allies in Congress to impeach judges who are blocking his agenda.\n\nBut legislation introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., could provide Johnson with an off-ramp, allowing his members to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that are all but doomed to fail.\n\nIssa's bill, the \"No Rogue Rulings Act,\" would seek to bar district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, the sort of rulings that have hampered Trump from fully enacting his plans on issues from deportation to federal agency cuts two months into the new administration. Johnson, a former constitutional attorney, threw his support behind the bill over the weekend.\n\n“We have a major malfunction in our federal judiciary, and practically every week another judge casts aside the tradition of restraint from the bench and opts to be the Trump resistance in robes,” Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told NBC News on Monday.\n\n“Our bill is the constitutional solution to a national problem, and that’s why it’s on a glide path to the House floor and to the Senate next,” he added.\n\nEven as some hard-line conservatives in the House introduce articles of impeachment against certain judges — most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump’s using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants — it's unlikely such resolutions could win enough Republican support to reach majorities in the House. In addition, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, said Monday on Fox News that his committee will hold a hearing next week focused on Boasberg and that Issa's bill is a “good piece of legislation.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., who controls the floor schedule, said Monday that the chamber would vote on it next week.\n\nIn an appearance Sunday on Fox News, Johnson appeared to throw cold water on the idea of impeaching judges, instead pointing to the appeals process as a way to fight back against rulings he disagreed with.\n\n“I do think the line is being crossed right now,” said Johnson, a former lawyer who litigated religious liberty cases. Recalling his experience, he said: “I never walked out of those courtrooms thinking that I could impeach those judges. I just got as quickly as I could to the appellate court to get them overturned.”\n\n“But something’s happening right now,” he continued, pointing to the number of Trump’s policies that had been blocked by federal injunctions. “Something’s amiss. I think we’ve got to address it.”\n\nAsked about the possibility of pursuing impeachment of judges Monday at the Capitol, Johnson told reporters that “everything is on the table” but added that “impeachment is an extraordinary measure” and that Republicans are looking at “all the alternatives.”\n\nOther senior House Republicans also aren’t in a rush to impeach judges who’ve ruled against Trump. Rep. Roger Williams, of Texas, the chair of the Small Business Committee, said Monday he has been entirely focused on Trump’s decision to have the Small Business Administration take over the Education Department’s student loan portfolio.\n\n“I do think the judge is overstepping. So we’ll see what happens,” Williams said of Boasberg.\n\nOther Republicans, including moderate Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska, said they oppose impeaching judges because of their decisions.\n\n\"I don't like that,\" Bacon told NBC News. \"Unless you do something illegal, or we've impeached judges for bribes and doing things like that, but not because somebody's trying to follow their sense of the Constitution. If you don't like it, appeal it. That's been our tradition since 1789.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., a former chair of two House committees, suggested that impeaching judges could come back to bite Republicans when Democrats are in control of the House in the future.\n\n“The thing I ask my colleagues in the House is, maybe we’re not happy with how certain judges are ruling now, but you set a standard that will apply for years or decades to come. How do you make sure that you don’t create retribution towards conservative judges in the future?” Lucas asked in an interview.\n\nHe said he is open to Issa's bill but not enthusiastic about it.\n\n“I’m not an attorney, but my understanding of the Constitution is that — after the Supreme Court — we create all the lower courts and we create the procedural stuff,” Lucas said. “I think his bill is within its legal scope, but that’s a big move, too.”\n\nRepublicans control 218 seats to Democrats’ 213 in the House, meaning Johnson can afford only two GOP defections on any vote. It explains why Republicans don’t believe impeaching judges — which would require simple-majority votes — could pass the House.\n\nBut if the House somehow did manage to impeach a judge, it would automatically trigger an impeachment trial in the Senate. That could eat up valuable floor time at a critical moment when Republicans in both chambers are trying to push forward on a package to advance Trump’s legislative agenda.\n\nOn Monday, Boasberg denied the government’s request to lift his hold on deportations under the Enemy Aliens Act of 1798, arguing that the Venezuelan nationals should be given a chance to challenge allegations that they are members of a gang. Boasberg’s decision has been appealed to a federal appeals court, which heard arguments Monday.\n\nBoasberg’s initial ruling prompted freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, last week to file articles of impeachment against Boasberg, the chief judge of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who in the past has been appointed by both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\n\"Activist judges know that even if their rulings get overturned on appeal, the process could take months or years, burning away valuable time from Trump’s Presidency, stopping him from executing on the mandate voters gave him,\" Gill said Friday on X. \"That’s why the Supreme Court must step in and Congress must act NOW.\"",

Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called “Houthi PC small group” on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.\n\nIn the article, Goldberg described his initial skepticism, recalling that he discussed with colleagues whether the texts were “part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service, or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization” seeking to embarrass journalists.\n\nGoldberg reported that he went on to receive a series of messages on Signal that appeared to come from Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Michael Waltz and other prominent officials in the Trump administration.\n\nAsked by a reporter Monday how the information was shared with a journalist and whether the material was classified, Hegseth made disparaging remarks about Goldberg, calling him a \"so-called journalist.\"\n\n\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that,\" he added.\n\nGoldberg responded to Hegseth's remarks during an MSNBC interview Monday night.\n\n\"He can say that it wasn't a war plan, but it was a minute-by-minute accounting of what was about to happen organized by CENTCOM,\" Goldberg told host Jen Psaki, referring to Central Command, which directs U.S. military operations for the Middle East and other regions. \"This is their plan, and he was taking their plan and sharing it with a bunch of civilian leaders.\"\n\nGoldberg added that Hegseth appears to be \"trying to deflect from the fact that he participated in a conversation on an unclassified, commercial messaging app that you probably shouldn't participate in.\"\n\nIn his article, Goldberg quoted from the text chain discussion and The Atlantic published screenshots of the Signal thread. He wrote that the military plan discussed in the group chat “included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing,” adding that he refrained from reporting specific information that could potentially damage national security.\n\nGoldberg reported that the user labeled \"Michael Waltz\" celebrated the launch of a series of airstrikes against the Houthis on March 15 at 1:48 p.m. ET, seven minutes before Goldberg checked X and saw that explosions were being heard across Sanaa, Yemen's capital.\n\n“The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,” the National Security Council said in its statement.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz speaks with the media following meetings with a Ukrainian delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11.

And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was,” Goldberg wrote.\n\nIn the article, Goldberg reported that a Signal account labeled “JD Vance” appeared to push back on the airstrike plans, saying in part: “I think we are making a mistake.” The user raised concerns about oil prices spiking, European nations benefiting from U.S. protection of global shipping lanes and a lack of public knowledge about the Houthis. The same account later replied to a user identified as “Pete Hegseth” and said, “if you think we should do it let’s go.”\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Vance’s office said the vice president’s “first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations.”\n\n“Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,” the vice president’s office said.\n\nTrump claimed he had no knowledge of the matter, telling a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon: “You're telling me about it for the first time.”\n\nThe president later made light of the incident on social media, sharing a screenshot on Truth Social of Elon Musk’s post on X taking a dig at the publication.\n\nTrump and Waltz spoke Monday afternoon about the Atlantic article, according to two sources familiar with their conversation, although it wasn't clear if Waltz was the first person to bring the story to Trump’s attention.\n\nTrump, as of late Monday night, had read the article himself, according to one of the sources.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Monday that Trump “continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.”\n\nThat statement was drafted and released after Trump spoke with Waltz about the article, one of the sources said.\n\nDemocrats erupt; Republicans less critical\n\nThe Atlantic article drew immediate criticism and mockery from Democratic lawmakers.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on X: “This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation’s most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe.”\n\n“Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime — even if accidentally — that would normally involve a jail sentence,\" said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., blasted the episode as “amateur hour.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party’s 2024 vice presidential candidate, quipped: “Pete Hegseth texting out war plans like invites to a frat party.”\n\nRep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., a member of the Armed Services Committee, characterized the episode as an \"outrageous national security breach\" and demanded \"a full investigation and hearing into this.\"\n\nHillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate who drew intense criticism from Republicans for her use of a private email server, tweeted a screenshot of the Atlantic article with a simple message: “👀 You have got to be kidding me.”\n\nSenate Republicans offered mixed reactions.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said, “You got to know who you’re sending your text to.”\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., appeared to echo that sentiment by saying, “Clearly, they’ve got to, you know, make sure that they’re careful how they do this.”\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said “somebody made a terrible mistake.”\n\n“I hope they learn from it so it doesn’t happen again,” he said.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called the incident “inconceivable and “an extremely troubling and serious matter.”\n\nSen. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., offered a blunter assessment, saying, “Somebody f---ed up.”\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he expected the incident to be discussed during an intelligence hearing Tuesday, saying the incident may be raised by Democrats “and some of my Republican colleagues may raise it just as an issue to be very concerned about.”\n\nIn the House, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., chided Trump’s national security team.\n\n“Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,” Lawler said on X. “Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.”",

In response to Goldberg's article about the incident, the National Security Council said in a statement the thread \"appears to be authentic.\"\n\nGoldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called \"Houthi PC small group\" on March 13 via encrypted messaging service Signal.

The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing.\n\nDowells’ killing remains under investigation, with charges pending prison and autopsy reports, Riebe said. Her husband, David Brinson, is serving four consecutive life terms for the murders of four men during a robbery in the 1990s. Now, Dowells’ son Armand Torres is questioning why Brinson was allowed to have family visits. He spoke to reporter Janelle Griffith about his mother’s relationship and how he trusted hem enough to allow his 3-year-old son to accompany her on prison visits.\n\n23andMe bankruptcy filing sparks privacy fears\n\nThe DNA data of millions of 23andMe users is up for sale after the genetic testing company declared bankruptcy on Sunday.

That’s changing this year, as three Democratic governors announced new initiatives aimed at addressing disparities afflicting boys and men. The effort has earned cautious applause from researchers studying the problems.

        "title": "Transgender Americans aim to block Trump's passport policy change",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "When Ash Lazarus Orr went to renew his passport in early January, the transgender organizer figured it would be relatively routine.\n\nBut more than two months on, Orr is waiting to get a new passport with a name change and a sex designation reflecting who he is. The delay has prevented him from traveling overseas to receive gender-affirming care this month in Ireland since he refuses to get a passport that lists an “inaccurate sex designation.”\n\nOrr blames the delay on President Donald Trump, who on the day he took office issued an executive order banning the use of the “X” marker as well as the changing of gender markers. The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender.\n\n“This is preventing me from having an accurate identification and the freedom to move about the country as well as internationally,” said Orr, who is among seven plaintiffs — five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs — who have sued the Trump administration in federal court over the policy. “This has really, truly impeded on my life and my freedom as well ... The government is questioning who I am as a trans person.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is suing the federal government on their behalf and will be in court Tuesday in Boston seeking a preliminary injunction, which would put the policy on hold while the lawsuit proceeds in court.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the ACLU described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the State Department. Another mailed in their passport on Jan. 9 and requested a name change and to change their sex designation from male to female. That person is still waiting for their passport — meaning they can’t leave Canada where they live and could miss a family wedding in May and a botany conference in July.\n\n“All have faced prior mistreatment due to their gender identities, and they fear that having incorrect sex designations on their passports will cause them further mistreatment — including putting them in danger,” the ACLU wrote.\n\nBefore he applied for his new passport, Orr was accused in early January by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration of using fake documents when traveling from West Virginia to New York — since he had a male designation on his driver’s license but a female one on his passport. That prompted him to request the updated passport with a sex designation of male — four days before Trump took office.\n\n“We all have a right to accurate identity documents, and this policy invites harassment, discrimination, and violence against transgender Americans who can no longer obtain or renew a passport that matches who they are,” ACLU lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has argued the passport policy change “does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.” They also contend that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad.\n\n“Some Plaintiffs additionally allege that having inconsistent identification documents will heighten the risk that an official will discover that they are transgender,” the Justice Department wrote. “But the Department is not responsible for Plaintiffs’ choice to change their sex designation for state documents but not their passport.”\n\nAfter the Trump executive order, the State Department quickly stopped issuing travel documents with the “X” gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don’t identify as strictly male or female, and used by some intersex people, who have sex characteristics that fall outside of traditional definitions of male or female. The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth.\n\nApplications that had already been submitted seeking gender-marker changes were put on hold. The State Department also replaced its webpage with information for “LGBTQI+” travelers to just “LGB,” removing any reference to transgender or intersex people.\n\nThe passport policy is among several actions Trump has taken since returning to office that could stifle rights and legal recognition of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people.\n\nThe same order that seeks to define the sexes to exclude them would also require housing transgender women in prison in men’s facilities. Additional orders could open the door to kicking transgender service members out of the military, barring the use of federal taxpayer money to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people under 19 and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women’s sports competitions.",

At least 10 Tesla dealerships, charging stations and facilities have been hit by vandals, many of whom have lit cars on fire.\n\nOver the weekend, a man in Florida was arrested and charged with assault after he allegedly drove his car toward a crowd of people protesting outside a Tesla dealership and narrowly avoided them. No one was injured.\n\nThe suspect, Andrew Dutil, appeared to be a Trump supporter based on his social media posts.\n\nA group called Tesla Takedown has been leading peaceful protests at the car dealerships. The group describes itself as opposing violence, vandalism and destruction of property.\n\n\"It is to do something to call attention to Musk to try to get him to leave his post in government,\" Joan Donovan, one of the original protest organizers, told NBC's Liz Kruetz on the group's cause.\n\nTesla stock is down more than 40% from a high in December, according to CNBC.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has made a show of supporting Musk. Earlier this month, they appeared together at an event on the White House lawn, showing off Tesla vehicles to reporters. Trump said he purchased a Tesla Cybertruck for his granddaughter, Kai Trump.",

        "content": "The Trump administration filed new allegations against Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student detained due to his pro-Palestinian activism on campus, while trying to dismiss his First Amendment violation claims as a \"red herring.\"\n\nIn a filing Sunday, the Justice Department said Khalil, who is a green-card holder, withheld information about his membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose his employment at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in his permanent residency application.\n\nKhalil, a native of Syria and citizen of Algeria, entered the U.S. on a student visa in December 2022 and was adjusted to lawful permanent resident status in November 2024.\n\nHe allegedly did not disclose that he was a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) as a political officer or that he was part of Columbia University Apartheid Divest when he applied to become a permanent resident in 2024, according to a Department of Homeland Security March 17 document, which the government referenced in its filing.\n\nThe administration claimed that Khalil also failed to disclose his employment as a program manager by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut after 2022, according to the document, which detailed additional grounds for Khalil's deportation. It is not immediately clear when or if Khalil stopped working at the embassy.\n\nAccording to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, it is considered fraud and willful misrepresentation if a permanent residency applicant \"misrepresents material facts\" to \"conceal group memberships\" that would make them ineligible for permanent residency status.\n\n\"It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the government filing states. \"Thus, Khalil’s First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil’s constitutional claim here.\"\n\nHowever, the government will have to prove to the immigration judge that Khalil willfully failed to disclose that information, and whether that disclosure would have impacted his eligibility for permanent residency.\n\nBaher Azmy, an attorney for Khalil, told NBC News: \"These late-breaking, after-the-fact allegations, silly as they are, primarily show that the government must know the supposed 'foreign policy' grounds for Mahmoud’s removal are absurd and unconstitutional.\"\n\nAzmy said the government's new claims \"cannot change the obvious fact the government has admitted — he is being punished in the most autocratic way for his constitutionally protected speech.\"\n\nMahmoud Khalil stands by the gates of Columbia University on April 30, 2024. Seth Harrison / USA Today Network file\n\nKhalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations at his Columbia University apartment on March 8. He was arrested in New York, transported briefly to a facility in New Jersey, and transported to an ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana on March 10.\n\nKhalil had been initially arrested under a rarely used provision in immigration law, where the Secretary of State has the authority to deport someone if it’s determined the person \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" in his activism at Columbia University. However, his attorneys deny the allegations, saying Khalil was targeted for free speech supporting the Palestinian cause.\n\nKhalil filed a lawsuit, also known as a habeas petition, protesting his detention in New York. The lawsuit cited a violation of his right to due process and the First Amendment right to free speech. Last week, a New York judge ordered the habeas petition to continue in New Jersey because Khalil’s attorneys filed the case while he was detained there.\n\nNew York Federal Judge Jesse Furman also barred his deportation amid the lawsuit, saying Khalil’s claims of First and Fifth Amendment violations warrant \"careful judicial review.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's Sunday filing in the district of New Jersey argued that the state lacked jurisdiction to hear the habeas case.\n\nIt further emphasized the administration's original argument for Khalil's arrest and sought to bypass his argument that he was targeted for free speech by pointing to his alleged lack of disclosures in his permanent residency application.\n\nKhalil, who is not facing any publicly known criminal charges, also has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he's being detained.\n\nMarc Van Der Hout, Khalil’s attorney in his deportation proceedings, told NBC News on Friday that \"this is not a typical case and it's outrageous.\"\n\n\"It’s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\" Van Der Hout said on the immigration law provision initially cited by the administration. \"The government is clearly going after him because they don’t like what he says about what’s going on in the Middle East and that’s the bottom line. We’re going to fight this strongly.\"\n\nFollowing the Israel-Hamas war, Columbia University became the forefront of student protests in support of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe Student Workers of Columbia labor union plans to hold an informational picket at 1 p.m. on Monday to demand protection for international student workers, the restoration of slashed funding, and \"reinstatement of all students disciplined for pro-Palestine activism and speech.\" Columbia faculty will also hold a \"Vigil to Defend Democracy\" at noon on Monday.",

In an interview with Russian state television, the first deputy chairman of Russia’s defense committee, Vladimir Chizhov, blamed the position taken by Ukraine.\n\n“They sat for 12 hours and seemed to have agreed on a joint statement,” Chizhov told Rossiya 24. “However this was not adopted due to Ukraine’s position,” he said, calling the holdup “very characteristic and symptomatic.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on the conclusion of the talks.\n\nWhile both sides have — in theory — agreed to a limited, 30-day ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin has imposed conditions that would essentially constitute a Ukrainian surrender. Meanwhile, Kyiv says the Kremlin is clearly uninterested in peace given that it continues to launch nightly mass drone attacks against the country.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, second right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, second left, at a previous round of talks in Riyadh last month. Russian Foreign Ministry / AFP - Getty Images\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Tuesday that there were no immediate plans for another call between Putin and Trump.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, is still counting the casualties from an attack a day earlier in the city of Sumy — on a dense residential area, a children’s hospital and a school — with authorities so far reporting 101 people injured, including 23 children.\n\nRussia fired 139 more Iran-designed Shahed drones into Ukraine overnight, Ukrainian officials said. They added that while 78 were shot down, others caused damaged in the regions of Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Cherkasy and Odessa.\n\n“Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement Monday. “Any diplomacy with Moscow must be backed up by firepower, sanctions, and pressure.”\n\nThree years after it was invaded by Putin, Ukraine has itself launched retaliatory strikes on targets related to the Kremlin’s war effort. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry said it shot down a Ukrainian drone headed for an oil pumping depot that supplies the country’s energy exports.\n\nThe ministry said that drone attacks launched by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"confirms his inability to negotiate.\" It added, \"The Kiev regime continues to deliberately plan, prepare and carry out attacks on energy infrastructure.\"\n\nRussia and Ukraine have continued this mutual bombardment despite agreeing to a limited ceasefire in principle earlier this month. The Kremlin, meanwhile, has issued demands tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender.\n\nThere have been subtly differing statements about what this ceasefire might cover, with American readouts referring to “energy and infrastructure” and the Kremlin referring only to “energy infrastructure.”\n\nU.S. and Russian negotiators have also presented starkly different accounts of how the talks were going.\n\nWhile Moscow's representatives have appeared circumspect, American officials have sounded optimistic about the talks in Saudi Arabia, even as a parallel ceasefire agreement brokered by the White House in the Gaza Strip has fallen apart.\n\nOne of the heads of Russia’s delegation in Riyadh, Grigorii Karasin, was more forthcoming, calling the negotiations “very useful.”\n\n“We discussed everything, there was a busy, not an easy dialogue, but very useful for us and for the Americans,” he told Russia’s state-controlled Tass news agency Tuesday.\n\n“Of course, not everything was resolved, not everything was agreed upon,” he added.\n\nOne issue being discussed is the \"Black Sea Initiative,\" which was designed to help Ukraine ship grain abroad while minimizing the impact of sanctions on Russian food and fertilizer exports. Moscow nixed this deal in 2023, complaining the second half of the deal was not being honored by Western countries.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would need \"clear guarantees\" to resume the deal, and that these \"guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy.\"\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that territory and \"lines of demarcation\" were among the subjects discussed in Riyadh, as well as a proposal by the U.S. to take control of a key nuclear plant in Ukraine.\n\n\"They are talking about ownership of the big nuclear power plant in particular,\" he said. “Something like that would be fine with me,” he added, calling it a \"great meeting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zelenskyy gave his most expansive account yet of the remarkable Oval Office bust-up between him, Trump and Vice President JD Vance last month.\n\nHe told Time magazine in an interview published Monday that he “was defending the dignity of Ukraine” during that discussion.",

        "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A teenager has died after triggering an avalanche, the fourth person killed in snow slides in Alaska this month.\n\nAlaska State Troopers said the body of 16-year-old Tucker Challan of Soldotna was recovered from the avalanche Sunday by the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group.\n\nTroopers said a group of snowmachiners were riding Saturday on the backside of Seattle Ridge in Turnagain Pass, a popular winter recreation area about 60 miles southeast of Anchorage.\n\n“Witnesses stated that a juvenile male triggered an avalanche and died after being buried,” troopers said in a statement.\n\nChallan was buried about 10-feet deep in the slide that measured about 500 feet wide, said Wendy Wagner, director of the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center.\n\nConditions are worrisome because a weak layer is located about 3 feet beneath the snow surface, with newer snow falling on top of the weak layer.\n\nChallan rode over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, about mid-slope, Wagner said.\n\nWhen the slide happened, the center’s staff was conducting an avalanche awareness day in a parking lot on the other side of Seattle Ridge, she said.\n\n“These types of avalanches, they can be triggered when you’re on this slope. They can be triggered when you’re on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,” she said.\n\nThe weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn’t cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down.\n\n“When we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren’t steep enough to slide, and then they don’t have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,” Wagner said. “They were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.”\n\nThe avalanche center has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on March 4, when three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles south of Anchorage.\n\n“It’s still unsafe,” Wagner said Monday. “We are still recommending that people stick to the lower angle slopes because this is not something we want to mess with.”",

Larsen’s sister, Kenna Bangerter, wrote in a since-expired Instagram story that the company \"demanded\" she return the equipment after her son, Rocky, died right before birth in November 2024.\n\nBangerter said the request was made because Larsen was no longer able to fulfill the promotional agreement.\n\n\"I want you to think about why she couldn’t deliver the content,\" Bangerter wrote. \"I’m absolutely disgusted by a BABY brand who promotes support for moms & babies — that doesn’t even have the decency to give her the space to grieve the bassinet she never got to fill.\"\n\nBangerter said that other brands have treated Larsen’s situation with \"grace & empathy and not like a transaction.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Happiest Baby tells TODAY.com in an exclusive statement that the company \"sincerely\" apologizes for the \"misguided and ill-conceived communication\" sent to Larsen’s management from one of its team members.\n\n\"We cannot express more emphatically our deepest sympathy for what she and her family have been through following the loss of her son,\" the statement reads, in part. \"What was intended to be an effort to provide assistance clearly was a mistake that added to Brooklyn’s grief, for which we are truly sorry. We have taken internal steps to make sure it never happens again. What Brooklyn faced was a tragedy beyond comprehension, and we are heartbroken for her loss.\"\n\nLarsen and Bangerter did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.\n\nMany people, including fellow SYTYCD alum Witney Carson and Allison Kuch, have been leaving messages on Happiest Baby’s social media accounts expressing their outrage.\n\n\"Very disappointed in your brand and the way you have handled the situation with Brooklyn. Be better for future mothers. Lost me as a customer and supporter,\" Carson wrote.\n\nAdded Kuch, \"Disgusted by the lack of human compassion & empathy.\"\n\nHappiest Baby was founded by Dr. Harvey Karp, a pediatrician and child development expert, widely known for his methods of soothing babies. Karp’s SNOO uses gentle rocking motions and white noise to mimic the calming effects of being in the womb.\n\nTo mark the three-month anniversary of Rocky’s passing, Larsen posted a tribute on Instagram in February.\n\n\"I wake up every day, and for a few seconds, there’s a sense of bliss before it hits me — he’s gone. Rocky wasn’t just in my head. He was here; I birthed him, and now he’s gone. People’s worst nightmare is my everyday reality,\" she shared.\n\nLarsen expressed deep gratitude for the outpouring of support her family has received, and concluded her post by celebrating what she called a \"small\" win.\n\n\"Ordering my drink today, the worker asked for my name for the order, and I so naturally and quickly said 'Rocky.' She looked up at me with the biggest smile and said, 'That’s the coolest name,'\" Larsen wrote. \"I smiled and said thank you; it’s my son’s name. I might start using his name more like that — it felt nice.\"",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Outside of the Olympics, there is no bigger competition in skating than the World Figure Skating Championships held the year before the Games.\n\nAll skaters compete to qualify for spots on their countries' Olympic teams. The very best can cement themselves as medal favorites for the 2026 Milan Cortina Games.\n\nFor American skaters, there is added significance. These worlds are being held in Boston, the first ones in the U.S. since 2016, and in the year before the Olympics for the first time since 2009.\n\nThe U.S. boasts the reigning world champions in men’s singles (Ilia Malinin) and ice dance (Madison Chock and Evan Bates), plus the world’s top women’s singles skater this season (Amber Glenn). Americans could win three of the four world titles for the first time.\n\nRemembering lives lost on Flight 5342\n\nThe Skating Club of Boston, the organizing host of these worlds, is one of the five figure skating clubs that lost members in the midair collision between American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29.\n\nThis Wednesday, the first day of the competition, a tribute will be held between the women’s and pairs’ short programs.\n\nMalinin belongs to the Washington Figure Skating Club, which also had skaters, skaters’ parents and a coach on Flight 5342.\n\n“I’ll always have them in my head and in my heart,\" he said last week.\n\nHe is dedicating his performances this week to the memories of everyone on the flight.\n\n‘Quadgod’ jumps to new heights\n\nMalinin, the 20-year-old nicknamed “Quadgod” for his mastery of four-revolution jumps, began this Olympic cycle in 2022 by becoming the first skater to land the only quad that had yet to be done — the Axel.\n\nHe didn’t stop there. Malinin continued to make history with unprecedented collections of jumps in his programs. He won last year’s world title by becoming the first skater to land six clean quads in one program and has won eight competitions in a row overall dating to December 2023.\n\nIn his last two competitions, he attempted seven quads in one program. He fell on one each time but still had the layout commemorated on a hoodie.\n\nMalinin said it’s an “ideal goal” to try seven again in Boston.\n\n“We’ll just have to see how I’ll be feeling in that moment, and if it would be worth it to go for that risk or to maybe play it safe,” he said in a virtual press conference.\n\nThat led a reporter to tell Malinin that it’s not his style to hold back.\n\n“Well, not all the time,” the skater said, “but I think sometimes, very rare occasions, I’d have to play it safe.”\n\nAmber Glenn is new U.S. women’s star\n\nU.S. figure skating was for so long defined by its leading women, from Peggy Fleming to Dorothy Hamill to Michelle Kwan.\n\nBut the last American to win Olympic women’s singles gold was in 2002 (Sarah Hughes). The last to win a world title was in 2006 (Kimmie Meissner).\n\nEnter Glenn.\n\nThe 25-year-old Texan won her first senior national title in 2024 on her ninth try over a career defined by hardships. She even briefly left the sport in 2015 at the recommendation of mental health professionals.\n\nGlenn began this season with zero international victories to her name.\n\nShe has since won all five of her starts, including the biggest title for any U.S. woman in 14 years at December’s Grand Prix Final, which is often a preview of the following March’s worlds.\n\nHer trademark is the triple Axel. She’s the only woman in the world championships field who has successfully landed the jump this year.\n\n“It has been a whirlwind of a season,” she said after the Grand Prix Final in France. “I kind of struggled with this imposter syndrome. I’m just happy my hard work is finally showing.”\n\nAll three U.S. women at worlds are capable of making the podium. Glenn is joined by 2024 silver medalist Isabeau Levito, who missed three months this season due to a foot injury, and 2022 bronze medalist Alysa Liu, who ended a two-year retirement to compete this season.\n\nThey’re all looking to dethrone Kaori Sakamoto of Japan, who can become the first woman to win four world titles in a row since American Carol Heiss took five from 1956-60.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates eye ice dance three-peat\n\nBack in 2011, an 18-year-old Chock went looking for a new ice dance partner after her previous partner retired. She spoke to and tried out with several men before ultimately choosing Bates, a 2010 Olympian whose own partnership had just ended.\n\n“Looking back on it, I can’t believe she picked me to skate together,” Bates said in 2023. “I’m sure I would have kept skating (if Chock chose somebody else) because I loved it, but it worked out this way, gratefully.”\n\nChock and Bates have since made three Olympic teams together, won a record-tying six U.S. ice dance titles and five world championships medals, including gold at the last two.\n\nAfter getting married last June, these could be the last worlds for Chock and Bates. They’re trying to become the first ice dancers to win three consecutive world titles in 28 years.\n\nNext year, they hope to earn their first Olympic medals of any color in the dance competition, having already won gold in the team event.\n\nWhat happens in Boston will determine whether they go into the Olympic season as the outright favorites or one of several medal contenders.\n\nThis season, Chock and Bates won the biggest event so far — December’s Grand Prix Final — but also were defeated at other events by top couples from Canada and Great Britain.\n\n“We’re going to treat it like it’s our last shot,” Bates said of the next 11 months. “We’ve been doing this for a really long time, both in our 30s. We’re a married couple. There are things in our lives that we would love to also accomplish, like grow a family and things like that.”",

In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, he said without evidence that “people that are very highly political on the left” are paying the vandals.\n\nTrump has called the destruction of Tesla property domestic terrorism, and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced charges on Thursday against three people accused of vandalizing Tesla properties in Oregon, South Carolina and Washington state.\n\nPublicly available court documents for the three people make no mention of coordination, an NBC News review found.\n\nExperts and law enforcement officials nationwide from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the two federal agencies investigating the attacks, all told NBC News they have found no evidence of any coordination around the attacks.\n\nIndividual field offices for both agencies are handling the incidents on a case-by-case basis, working with partner agencies to determine if they warrant local, state or federal charges, the law enforcement officials said. Several said federal law enforcement agents from various areas of the country have been sharing information on the Tesla attacks, but have not found a common link other than the brand itself.\n\nAn FBI public service announcement published Friday evening warned that individuals have targeted Tesla vehicles and dealerships across the country “with arson, gunfire, and vandalism.”\n\n“These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders,” it says.\n\n“If there is coordination (for the vandalism, not the protests), it’s not in the public domain,” John Horgan, the director of Georgia State University’s Violent Extremism Research Group, said in an email.\n\n“There’s no evidence they’re connected,” said John Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.\n\n“What’s tricky is that unlike previous culture war flashpoint conspiracies, this one seems to have the attention of the Justice Department,” he said.\n\nMusk, a federal adviser and top donor to Trump, has become the face of massive cuts to the U.S. federal government, leading to growing unpopularity among some Americans. An NBC News poll this month found that while many Americans support cutting federal government waste, a majority now hold negative views of Musk.\n\nAnd while there does not appear to be any coordination around the attacks on Tesla dealerships, there have been organized efforts, such as Tesla Takedown, aimed at rallying people to show up at Tesla facilities to protest Musk. That group has disavowed violence and property destruction.\n\nDislike of Musk and Tesla has become increasingly popular online. Videos of people keying Tesla cars and spreading dog feces on Cybertrucks have circulated widely. Police reports say the vandalism has extended to people shooting automatic rifles and throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla stores.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said the bureau is still gathering information.\n\n“The FBI is working with our law enforcement partners to investigate a number of incidents in which Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged. Incidents have occurred in several states and the FBI is coordinating with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to gather information,” the spokesperson said.\n\nOn his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said Friday that people who deface Tesla locations could face extrajudicial rendition to El Salvador.\n\n“I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!” he said.\n\nLewis, of George Washington University, said the president’s push to label Tesla vandalism as terrorism is worrisome.\n\n“The idea that you could take Americans who have not been charged with a terrorism offense, let alone convicted of it, and talk about deporting them to a foreign country to serve prison sentences is incredibly chilling,” Lewis said.",

Since tournament expansion created the Round of 16 in 1975, every Sweet 16 has featured at least seven conferences, with a record of 11.\n\nYet midnight arrived early for Cinderella in 2025.\n\nThe last, best hope for a “mid-major” conference to advance to the tournament’s second weekend was 12th-seeded Colorado State of the Mountain West, which lost to Maryland of the Big Ten on Sunday night on a buzzer-beater.\n\nAs with most college sports developments in recent years, conference realignment has played a role.\n\nAs conferences have grown, the odds their schools will make up a larger share of the tournament’s bracket has increased.\n\nSixth-seeded BYU, which beat Virginia Commonwealth and Wisconsin to advance to the second weekend, had represented mid-major conferences until 2023 when it joined the Big 12 — one of the NCAA’s “Power Five” conferences, a number that dropped to four last year upon the collapse of the Pac-12 — after the conference went looking to add new members following Texas and Oklahoma’s departure for the SEC.\n\nThe tournament’s opening weekend still featured a handful of surprises. Twelfth-seeded McNeese State, the champion of the one-bid Southland Conference, beat fifth-seeded Clemson of the ACC, and 11th-seeded Drake of the Missouri Valley Conference beat Missouri of the SEC in the opening round.\n\nYet the tournament that derives much of its lore — and value from its $8 billion media-rights deal with CBS and Turner — from its unpredictability and parity has instead been mostly chalk. In the Midwest region, in particular, a lower seed won only one of 12 possible games through the first two rounds.\n\nThe Big Ten won its first 10 games of the tournament. And the SEC, which last week was celebrating a single-conference record of placing 14 teams in the 68-team bracket, watched as a record seven advanced to the Sweet 16.\n\nOf the 16 teams that began the tournament seeded first through fourth, 12 remain alive. Following Sunday’s loss by two-time defending champion Connecticut, this year’s tournament will crown a new champion.\n\nIt just won’t come from out of nowhere.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump stood by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, after The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief was accidentally added to a private, high-level chat on the messaging app Signal where military plans were being discussed.\n\n\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,\" Trump said Tuesday in a phone interview with NBC News.\n\nTrump's comments were his first substantive remarks since The Atlantic broke the story, which detailed how journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat on a private messaging app where plans for military strikes in Yemen were discussed. Goldberg said he was added to the discussion after receiving a request from a user identified as Waltz.\n\nWhen asked what he was told about how Goldberg came to be added to the Signal chat, Trump said, “It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.”\n\nTrump said Goldberg’s presence in the chat had “no impact at all” on the military operation.\n\nThe president expressed confidence in his team, saying he was not frustrated by the events leading up to The Atlantic's story. The situation, Trump said, was \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.\"\n\nThe Atlantic’s story sent shockwaves across Washington on Monday. Democratic lawmakers demanded answers from the White House in multiple letters, with one from a group of Senate Democrats calling the situation “an astonishingly cavalier approach to national security.”\n\nTop Democrats on the House Armed Services, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees wrote a separate letter, pushing for answers about other instances in which senior officials discussed national security issues “using the Signal messaging service or any other messaging service application that has not been approved for the transmission of classified information.”\n\nWhite House officials defended the chat, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claiming on Monday that “nobody was texting war plans.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday also claimed war plans were not discussed and \"no classified material was sent to the thread.\"\n\n\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the thread,\" she added.\n\nIn a statement about the incident, the National Security Council said the thread “is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security.”\n\nTrump and Waltz spoke on Monday about The Atlantic’s story, according to two sources familiar with their conversation. Waltz has not yet commented publicly on the story.\n\nThe news of the group chat mishap came 10 years ago to the month after it was revealed that Hillary Clinton used a private email server at times during her tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration. That revelation prompted staunch criticism from Republicans, several of whom appeared to be part of the Signal chat, according to The Atlantic.\n\nGoldberg reported that he was skeptical about the Signal chat's authenticity at first. But when bombs began falling in Yemen at the time officials in the group chat had discussed it, Goldberg concluded that the chat was “almost certainly real” and left shortly after.\n\nTrump briefly responded to a question about The Atlantic’s story on Monday, saying, “I don’t know anything about it” and noting that the reporter asking him about the story was “telling me about it for the first time.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "BEIJING — China courted the executives of major U.S. businesses at an annual conference this week in a sign of how Beijing seeks to offset trade pressures, rather than retaliate forcefully.\n\nChina has long sought to attract foreign investment as a way to bolster growth, while tapping business interests for potential influence on the White House, particularly under U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. has twice increased tariffs across all Chinese goods since January, but Beijing has only announced targeted duties and restrictions on a handful of American companies.\n\nConversation on the sidelines of the state-organized China Development Forum this week in Beijing reinforced a more conciliatory stance than official rhetoric this month about how China is prepared to fight “any type of war” with the United States.\n\nChinese conference attendees weren’t that focused on what can be done to respond to U.S. tariffs, Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, told CNBC.\n\n“The questions I’ve been getting more [are], why is Trump doing this? What is he trying to achieve? What does he think it takes to really make America great?” Roach said. He has attended the event since the early 2000s.\n\n“My answer is this is an unprecedented period for America’s role in the world economy. We’re going back to a tariff regime that history tells us can be extremely destructive,” Roach said, adding that he expects more policy uncertainty in the U.S. and around the world “for a long, long time.”\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Sunday. Adek Berryadek Berry / AFP - Getty Images\n\nU.S. stocks have swung in recent weeks as investors try to assess the economic impact of Trump’s changing plans for tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that tariffs could delay progress on lowering inflation in the U.S.\n\nA message of ‘reassurance’\n\nAt this week’s conference, China was trying to send a message of “reassurance” — on how it plans to boost consumption and how the country is headed in a “modestly positive direction” relative to what is happening in the U.S., said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf the U.S. imposes significantly large tariffs in early April, “then you go from managing costs and de-risking to possibly decoupling,” Kennedy told CNBC. “And then that might mean the game is up. So I think the level of anxiety is pretty high. And that’s why China is trying to provide this message of reassurance.”\n\nThe Trump administration has threatened a swath of new tariffs on major trading partners starting in early April. China has increased its trade with Southeast Asian countries and the European Union, but the U.S. remains Beijing’s largest trading partner on a single-country basis.\n\nThe China Development Forum ran Sunday and Monday. Apple CEO Tim Cook was among the executives who attended, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk was not.\n\n“The increased optimism this year compared to last year at the CDF has been just so heart-warming,” Ken Griffin, CEO of hedge fund Citadel, said during an official panel at the forum.\n\nTrump “is committed to American companies having access to a global market,” Griffin said. “And the president is willing to use tariffs to seek to enforce this worldview.”\n\nFirst step toward Xi-Trump meeting?\n\nAlso on Sunday, U.S. Republican Sen. Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing — the first time a U.S. politician has visited China since Trump began his latest term in January.\n\n“This was the first step to an important next step, which will be a meeting between President Xi and President Trump,” Daines told the Wall Street Journal. “When that occurs and where it occurs is to be determined.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLi urged cooperation and said no one can gain from a trade war, according to state media.\n\nFedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, Boeing Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Medtronic CEO Geoffrey Martha, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, UL Solutions CEO Jennifer Scanlon and U.S.-China Business Council President Sean Stein were also present at Daines’ meeting with Li, according to a foreign media pool report.\n\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy, remains a significant source of revenue for many multinational corporations, not to mention a major part of their supply chains.\n\nDespite its efforts to bolster international business ties, the country has warned of countermeasures on U.S. tariffs and taken incremental steps.\n\nFollowing U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei during Trump’s first term as president, Beijing launched an unreliable entities list that restricts foreign business activity with China.\n\nChina added Calvin Klein parent PVH and a few other U.S. companies to the list after this year’s tariff increases. On Monday, China also said it would soon reveal new measures that would give it a legal basis for countering foreign pressure.\n\nEconomic factors\n\nFor U.S. companies in China, the state of the economic recovery has also been an important factor for local business plans.\n\nSince late September, China has stepped up efforts to support the economy. Top policymakers earlier this month affirmed stimulus plans and a recent effort to encourage private-sector tech entrepreneurs in the wake of DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence breakthroughs.\n\n“This year, you feel a lot of positive momentum beginning in China. So I feel like recovery is underway,” Wendell P. Weeks, CEO of Corning, told CNBC.\n\nHowever, China’s economy has struggled with deflationary pressure and a real estate slump, weighing on regional growth prospects for international businesses.\n\nEven Beijing’s push to support high-tech manufacturing has so far only added an average 1.1 percentage points to gross domestic product growth in each of the last three years — not enough to offset the 1.7-percentage-point drag from real estate during that time, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.\n\n“We will remain optimistic because the role of technology is important, I think more than ever,” Qualcomm’s Amon told CNBC. “I think technology is going to be part of economic growth.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "DoorDash and Klarna are joining forces to let users pay for meal deliveries with installment loans, calling it “essential to meeting our customers’ needs.” Not everyone sees it that way.\n\nThe announcement has drawn a flurry of criticism on social media, less directed at the companies themselves than questioning what the need to use a “buy now, pay later” service for food orders says about the increasingly debt-ridden economy.\n\n“Eat now, pay later? A credit apocalypse is coming,” an X user wrote Thursday when the partnership was announced.\n\nAnother X poster used a photo of a forlorn-looking Dave Ramsey, the personal finance pundit, with the caption, “what do you mean you have $11k in ‘doordash debt’.”\n\nOthers whipped up “Sopranos” memes, quipping about “DoorDash debt collection outside your door because you missed a Chipotle payment.”\n\nThe economic commentator Kylan Scanlon said in a social media video that the deal was another example of the “gambling economy.”\n\n“We have memecoins, sports betting — we love a good vice in the United States, and we can do it completely frictionless,” she said. “We don’t even have to put on pants. Just app it to you and worry about everything else later.” She added that “there are real winners and losers” in business models that monetize not just convenience but “impulsivity.”\n\nKlarna, which is preparing for an initial public offering, is among the BNPL providers that have surged into virtually all corners of the consumer economy since the pandemic, such as Afterpay, Affirm and Sezzle.\n\nThe lightly regulated financial services give users a variety of ways to pay for purchases; among the most popular are short-term loans that can typically be repaid in several interest-free installments. The companies make money by charging users for late or missed payments and merchants for the ability to offer BNPL loans at checkouts.\n\nDoorDash said customers will be able to use Klarna for many types of purchases on its platform, not just small-dollar food deliveries. They can pay in full up front, in four installments or else later on, “such as a date that aligns with their paycheck schedules.”\n\nA Klarna spokesperson acknowledged the online pushback but said any form of borrowing for food purchases is potentially concerning, depending on the circumstances.\n\n“If people are in a situation where they feel like they have to put their food on credit, that’s a bad indicator for society,” the spokesperson said.\n\nStill, many people make “a rational decision” to use BNPL services to help manage their money, the spokesperson said, adding that the new features would be available only for DoorDash purchases of at least $35 — a few dollars more than the platform’s average order as of last March. “Wherever high-cost credit cards are accepted, consumers should be able to choose a zero-interest credit product, instead.”\n\nIndeed, industrywide data shows the short-term loans have become a routine feature of many consumers’ wallets, particularly among young adults coping with inflation and with average credit card interest rates still near 20%.\n\nThe BNPL explosion coincides with record debt levels and mounting consumer pessimism. Total household debt exceeded $18 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with credit card balances comprising a record $1.2 trillion of that sum. Consumer sentiment fell this month to its lowest level since 2022, and borrowers’ expectations for missing debt payments in the next three months hit their highest level since 2020, the New York Fed found.\n\nA spokesperson for DoorDash didn’t comment on the criticism of its partnership with Klarna, saying their collaboration “provides even more flexibility, control and options.” The delivery service noted that its users can already pay with Venmo and CashApp, as well as government aid, including SNAP benefits. Klarna is already available on the grocery delivery platform Instacart, and it recently replaced rival Affirm as Walmart’s exclusive BNPL partner.\n\nMuch of the concern over BNPL has focused on the potential effects on borrowers’ credit histories, which largely still don’t reflect use of the services despite years of discussions with credit-reporting bureaus to change that. Yet a study released last month by Affirm and the credit-scoring firm FICO showed most consumers with five or more Affirm loans saw no real downside to their credit scores, some of which actually increased. And consumers consistently rate BNPL products favorably in surveys. Last year, 89% of borrowers told TransUnion they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the services.\n\nBut personal finance experts and consumer advocates say the qualms kicked up by the DoorDash-Klarna deal reflect real financial risks.\n\n“Making four payments to cover three tacos on Tuesday sounds complicated because it is,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. “I wouldn’t characterize this as a solution. It is a fintech innovation that creates problems.”\n\nNot only might users face Klarna’s own late fees, he said, but “once customers consent to repay with automatic debits, they risk additional overdraft fees” from their banks.\n\nRust also highlighted recent work by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that remains in jeopardy or has been stopped altogether as the Trump administration defangs the agency.\n\nThe CFPB recently granted BNPL customers more ability to dispute charges and get refunds, but with staffers ordered to stop all enforcement activity last month, former employees and consumer advocates believe the rule has been rendered moot. A trade group representing fintech businesses, including some BNPL lenders but not Klarna, asked the Trump administration this month for an exemption from a law scheduled to take effect next week requiring certain lenders to verify borrowers’ ability to repay loans before they front them money.\n\nFinancial planners have long cautioned clients against budgetary strains from BNPL overuse. Even some borrowers themselves who’ve spent heavily with the services have begun warning others of their risks, saying they make it easy for cash-strapped users to rack up debts that are tough to pay off.\n\n“Eat now, pay later is an awful trap,” Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm focused on millennials, wrote on X last week. “If you need to borrow to have a burrito delivered to you, you are the product. Nothing more.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A Columbia University student who took part in campus protests against Israel's military offensive in Gaza is facing deportation, according to a Monday lawsuit.\n\nLawyers for Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old permanent resident, allege that their client was a victim of \"shocking overreach\" by the government, which is seeking to deport her because of her political views and constitutionally protected protest activities.\n\nThe Monday lawsuit seeks to stop the deposition and the \"pattern and practice of targeting individuals associated with protests for Palestinian rights for immigration enforcement,\" adding that Chung's detainment came around the same time as Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil's arrest earlier this month.\n\n\"The government’s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nOriginally from South Korea, Chung and her family have lived in the United States since she was 7 years old. The lawsuit states that immigration officials signed an administrative arrest warrant for Chung on March 8, the same time Khalil was arrested. Like Khalil, her permanent resident status means she does not need a student visa.\n\nHowever, unlike Khalil, Chung was not arrested or detained by immigration officials, and her lawyers are seeking to ensure that she remains that way.\n\nJoshua Colangelo-Bryan of Human Rights First, one of the groups legally representing her, told NBC News Tuesday that federal officers had simply not managed to find Chung in order to carry out a warrant for her arrest.\n\n\"The government has been very clear that it intends to expel people who have green cards if they express ideas, particularly relating to Gaza, that it doesn’t agree with,\" he said.\n\nColangelo-Bryan said that he was not aware of other students with green cards who were in this situation but said, \"I would not be remotely surprised if we find out that there are other people being targeted by the government, even though they've done nothing except voice concern about civilians being killed.\"\n\nThe suit names President Donald Trump and other cabinet members as defendants, as well as acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons and acting ICE New York Field Office Director William P. Joyce. It accused the government of using the threat of deportation as \"a tool to punish non-citizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.\"\n\nICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nPresident Trump, who called Khalil a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\" and promised more arrests of student protesters, has yet to publicly mention Yunseo's case.\n\nMahmoud Khalil stands by the gates of Columbia University on April 30. Olivia Falcigno / USA Today Network file\n\nChung's legal team has filed a petition for habeas corpus, which means that an authority is compelled to bring someone before a court to determine the legality of their detention.\n\nThe lawsuit says Chung, a promising student who was valedictorian at high school and excelled at college, took part in campus protests beginning in 2023. However, Chung did not have a high-profile, public role in the pro-Palestinian movement or speak to the press.\n\nOn March 5, she was arrested but not detained while participating in a protest at Columbia against what activists believed were unfair punishments given to student protesters. The lawsuit says Chung only received a \"desk appearance ticket\" from the New York Police Department, a citation given to many protesters which the courts are still deciding.\n\nShe also faced college disciplinary proceedings twice — including for putting up posters accusing Columbia of \"complicity in genocide.\" She was found not to have violated university policy, but the lawsuit says she has been suspended since March 7.\n\nDays later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials signed a warrant for her arrest, and on March 9, officials appeared at her parents' house seeking her.\n\nOn March 10, an assistant United States attorney named Perry Carbone messaged one of Chung's attorneys to say that her visa had been \"revoked.\" When Chung's attorney explained that she has a green card and doesn't require a visa, Carbone replied: \"The secretary of state has revoked that too,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nOn March 13, Department of Homeland Security agents executed search warrants at two Columbia residents, including Chung's dorm, the lawsuit says. The search was an attempt to find occupancy or lease agreements and travel and immigration records, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nChung's attorney said the secretary of state doesn't have the authority to unilaterally revoke permanent resident status, but Carbone \"could not explain the justification for the government's purported action.\"\n\nKhalil's case will be heard at a court hearing in New York later on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A motorcyclist died after falling into a sinkhole in the South Korean capital, authorities said Tuesday, in the latest such fatal incident.\n\nThe man in his 30s, who has not been publicly identified, was found in cardiac arrest around noon local time on Tuesday, the day after a sinkhole about 65 feet wide and 65 feet deep opened up without warning as he was driving down a street in Seoul, according to the Gangdong Fire Station.\n\nThe massive sinkhole appeared around 6:30 p.m. Monday (5:30 a.m. ET) near an intersection in the Gangdong district of Seoul.\n\nA dashcam video geolocated by NBC News showed the motorcyclist plunge into the sinkhole while a car in front of him jolted violently as its rear wheels barely avoided the hole.\n\nHis body was discovered about 160 feet below the center of the sinkhole after an overnight search involving about 40 rescue personnel. Rescuers also found the victim’s mobile phone and motorcycle.\n\nThe search operation, which lasted for 17 hours, was difficult due to the water and soil mixed together at the scene and the entangled heavy machinery from a nearby construction site, an official from the fire station told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“It was only after draining the area and deploying heavy equipment to remove the soil that we were able to locate the man,” he added.\n\nA woman in her 40s who was passing through the site before the sinkhole opened suffered a minor injury and is now recovering in the hospital.",

        "title": "Ex-FIFA chief Blatter and soccer great Platini cleared in corruption case",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter and France soccer great Michel Platini were both cleared of corruption charges by a Swiss court on Tuesday, two-and-a-half years after they were first acquitted of the offenses.\n\nThe pair, once among the most powerful figures in global soccer, were cleared of fraud at the Extraordinary Appeals Chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court in the town of Muttenz, near Basel.\n\nThe hearing came about after Swiss federal prosecutors appealed against their 2022 acquittal at a lower court. Both men had denied the charge.\n\n“After two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed. Michel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,” Platini’s lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement.\n\nThe case related to a 2 million Swiss franc ($2.26 million) payment Blatter authorized for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, in 2011.\n\nThe payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work carried out between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because FIFA lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.\n\nThe scandal, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer’s ruling body UEFA, ended his hopes of succeeding Blatter, who was forced out of FIFA over the affair.\n\n“The criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini — although no incriminating evidence was ever presented. Among other things, the criminal proceedings prevented his election as FIFA president in 2016,” Nellen said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "With genetic testing company 23andMe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and courting bidders, the DNA data of millions of users is up for sale.\n\nA Silicon Valley stalwart since 2006, 23andMe has steadily amassed a database of people’s fundamental genetic information under the promise of helping them understand their disposition to diseases and potentially connecting with relatives.\n\nBut the company’s bankruptcy filing Sunday means information is set to be sold, causing massive worry among privacy experts and advocates.\n\n“Folks have absolutely no say in where their data is going to go,” said Tazin Khan, CEO of the nonprofit Cyber Collective, which advocates for privacy rights and cybersecurity for marginalized people.\n\n“How can we be so sure that the downstream impact of whoever purchases this data will not be catastrophic?” she said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta warned people in a statement Friday that their data could be sold. In the statement, Bonta offered users instructions on how to delete genetic data from 23andMe, how to instruct the company to delete their test samples and how to revoke access from their data's being used in third-party research studies.\n\nDNA data is extraordinarily sensitive.\n\nIts primary use at 23andMe — mapping out a person’s potential predisposed genetic conditions — is data that many people would prefer to keep private. In some criminal cases, genetic testing data has been subpoenaed by police and used to help criminal investigations against people's relatives.\n\nSecurity experts caution that if a bad actor can gain access to a person’s biometric data like DNA information, there’s no real remedy: Unlike passwords or even addresses or Social Security numbers, people cannot change their DNA.\n\nA spokesperson for 23andMe said in an emailed statement that there will be no change to how the company stores customers’ data and that it plans to follow all relevant U.S. laws.\n\nBut Andrew Crawford, an attorney at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology, said genetic data lawfully acquired and held by a tech company has almost no federal regulation to begin with.\n\nNot only does the United States not have a meaningful general digital privacy law, he said, but Americans’ medical data faces less legal scrutiny if it’s held by a tech company rather than by a medical professional.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which regulates some ways in which health data can be shared and stored in the United States, largely applies only “when that data is held by your doctor, your insurance company, folks kind of associated with the provision of health care,” Crawford said.\n\n“HIPAA protections don’t typically attach to entities that have IOT [internet of things] devices like fitness trackers and in many cases the genetic testing companies like 23andMe,” he said.\n\nThere is precedent for 23andMe’s losing control of users’ data.\n\nIn 2023, a hacker gained access to the data of what the company later admitted were around 6.9 million people, almost half of its user base at the time.\n\nThat led to posts on a dark web hacker forum, confirmed by NBC News as at least partially authentic, that shared a database that named and identified people with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. The company subsequently said in a statement that protecting users’ data remained “a top priority” and vowed to continue investing in protecting its systems and data.\n\nEmily Tucker, the executive director of Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, said the sale of 23andMe should be a wake-up call for Americans about how easily their personal information can be bought and sold without their input.\n\n“People must understand that, when they give their DNA to a corporation, they are putting their genetic privacy at the mercy of that company’s internal data policies and practices, which the company can change at any time,” Tucker said in an emailed statement.\n\n“This involves significant risks not only for the individual who submits their DNA, but for everyone to whom they are biologically related,” she said.",

        "content": "Star Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts' body is \"just kind of eating itself,\" he said this week, as a mystery illness has cost him more than 20 pounds and kept him out of action this young 2025 season.\n\nBetts didn't play in Los Angeles' two regular-season-opening wins in Tokyo last week and he wasn't able to take the field for a pair of preseason games at home Sunday and Monday against the Angels.\n\nThe 2018 American League MVP came into spring straining at 175 pounds and is now down to 150 as he's been unable to keep down any solid food.\n\n\"I'm scared to eat, so I really don't know what to do,\" he told reporters.\n\nBlood tests and vitals have \"come back really, really clean\" so doctors are at a loss to explain this health scare, Betts said.\n\n\"I'm practicing all day and my body's just kind of eating itself and so it's hard to not fuel it,\" Betts said. \"And so every time, literally, every time I fuel my body, I throw it up.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old said he started feeling sick two days before his team jetted off to Japan and the long plan ride only exacerbated the situation.\n\n\"So got on the plane, I thought I would at least give myself a couple days to kind of heal and then the plane ride was brutal,\" he said. \"That was one of the worst playing plane rides I ever had.\"\n\nThe team's North American opener is set for Thursday afternoon at home against the Detroit Tigers. At this point, it's unknown when Betts will be able to play again.\n\nDespite the big weight loss, Betts said he wants to play as soon as he can keep food down.\n\n\"It's just hard to fathom not eating,\" he said.\"So it looks like I'm just going to be light for a little bit. Maybe I have to play uphill a little bit for the beginning of the season. But you know I just want to play, man. I'm tired of sitting, tired of just throwing up, tired of doing all of this.\"",

        "content": "The United Nations said on Monday it is reducing its international staff numbers in Gaza by about a third after Israeli strikes in the enclave that have killed hundreds of civilians, including United Nations personnel.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told a regular news briefing the move was taken for security and operational reasons and would involve the withdrawal of about 30 of the 100 or so international staff currently in Gaza.\n\n“What we’re doing is reducing the number of international staff members by about one third this week, maybe a bit more likely to come. It’s a temporary measure. We hope to have people return to Gaza as soon as practicable,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that the U.N. was not leaving Gaza.\n\nA woman mourns outside a hospital morgue in Khan Younis, southern Gaza on Tuesday. Abed Rahim Khatib / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n“The Secretary-General has taken the difficult decision ... even as humanitarian needs soar and our concern over the protection of civilians intensifies,” he said. “The organization remains committed to continuing to provide aid that civilians depend on for their survival and protection.”\n\nDujarric said that based on information currently available, strikes that hit a UN compound in Deir Al Balah on March 19, killing a Bulgarian U.N. worker and leaving six others — from France, Moldova, North Macedonia, the Palestine territories and the United Kingdom — with severe injuries, came from an Israeli tank.\n\n“The location of this U.N. compound was well known to the parties to the conflict,” he said, noting that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres had demanded “a full, thorough and independent investigation.”\n\nDamage to an ambulance repair yard hit by Israeli strikes in central Gaza on Monday. Eyad Baba / AFP via Getty Images\n\nGaza’s health ministry attributed the strike to Israel, but Israel denied this, saying it hit a Hamas site where it detected preparations for firing into Israeli territory.\n\nAsked if the U.N. believed the compound had been deliberated targeted, Dujarric said: “I think that’s one of the reasons we need to have a pretty clear and transparent investigation. The point is that the Israelis knew exactly where this UN facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces had fired on Monday at a building belonging to the Red Cross in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah as a result of incorrect identification, after an office belonging to the aid organization was damaged by an explosive projectile.",

        "content": "Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office. The group chat shows their shared animus against “European freeloading.”\n\nTrump administration officials haven’t kept their disdain for Europe quiet. But the contempt seems to be even louder behind closed doors.\n\nEuropeans reacted with a mix of exasperation and anger to the publication of parts of a discussion between top-ranking Trump administration officials, carried out on the messaging app Signal. The discussion, about a planned strike on Yemen, was replete with comments that painted Europeans as geopolitical parasites, and was revealed on Monday in The Atlantic, whose editor was inadvertently included in the conversation.\n\n“I just hate bailing out the Europeans again,” wrote Vice President JD Vance, asserting that the strikes would benefit Europe far more than the United States.\n\n“I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,” Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, later replied. “It’s PATHETIC.”\n\nThe exchange seemed to show real feelings and judgments — that the Europeans are mooching and that any American military action, no matter how clearly in American interests as well, should be somehow paid for by other beneficiaries.\n\nA member of the chat identified as “SM,” and believed to be Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Trump, suggested that both Egypt and “Europe” should compensate the United States for the operation. “If Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,” SM wrote.\n\nImage The Trump administration’s stance toward Europe and Ukraine has prompted a series of international summits, including one in London this month. Credit... Javad Parsa/NTB, via Reuters\n\nThe apparent disregard by administration officials of security protocols by having such a discussion — which included operational details — on a consumer chat app, even an encrypted one, prompted concern that Russia and China could be listening in.\n\n“Putin is now unemployed: No point in spying anymore,” Nathalie Loiseau, a member of European Parliament, wrote on X, saying the leaks now came from the Americans themselves. “No point in crushing Ukraine anymore, Trump will take care of it.”\n\nThe commentary in the exchange is the latest blow to one of the world’s most storied alliances, which took generations to build and strengthen but which the Trump administration has managed to weaken in mere weeks.\n\n“It is clear that the trans-Atlantic relationship, as was, is over, and there is, at best, an indifferent disdain,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs, who formerly advised a top E.U. official. “And at worst, and closer to that, there is an active attempt to undermine Europe.”\n\nThe European Union is, in many ways, the antithesis of the principles that Mr. Trump and his colleagues are championing. The bloc is built around an embrace of international trade based on rules. It has been at the forefront of climate-related regulation and social media user protections.\n\nEurope has been on alert ever since Mr. Vance delivered a speech at a security conference in Munich last month that questioned European values and its democracy and shocked European leaders. He followed that up by warning that Europe was at risk of “civilizational suicide.”\n\nImage Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich Security Conference last month shocked European leaders. Credit... Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nIf the relationship between the United States and Europe were merely transactional, it would be relatively easy for Europeans to just spend more on the military and give Mr. Trump some sort of victory, said François Heisbourg, a French analyst and former defense official.\n\nBut in Mr. Vance’s speech attacking European democracy in Munich, let alone in the newly public exchange, the distaste for Europe is about more than transactions.\n\n“Vance was quite clear: We don’t share the same values,” Mr. Heisbourg said.\n\nHe and others, like Anna Sauerbrey, the foreign editor of Die Zeit, noted that the explicit demand for payment, rather than just political and military support, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, was new. And it ignored the fact that “the U.S. depends on global trade,” she said, and that “France, Britain and the Netherlands have deployed ships to the region” for the same purpose. The Americans, she said, “are constantly overlooking European efforts.”\n\nChina, for example, gets most of its oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz and does much of its export trade with Europe through the same sea route. But no one is asking China to pay, Ms. Tocci noted.\n\nFor months, Washington has been sending barbed statements and actions Europe’s way.\n\nMr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, even as European leaders warn that they will defend territorial integrity. Usha Vance, Mr. Vance’s wife, and Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, are visiting the island this week, uninvited, its government says, and to an agitated response.\n\nImage Demonstrators outside the U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, this month, to protest the idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland. Credit... Christian Klindt Soelbeck/Ritzau Scanpix, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump has also repeatedly warned that Europe must pay much more for its own defense, threatening not to come to the aid of nations that do not pay up sufficiently, and has pivoted sharply away from Ukraine. He has simultaneously rolled out plans to slap hefty tariffs on Europe and argued that the European Union was created to “screw” America.\n\nChristel Schaldemose, a Danish politician who is a center-left member of European Parliament, said the way the U.S. has been talking about the E.U. in general lately is “not helping.”\n\n“Could we start talking to each other as allies and not enemies?” she said.\n\nEven as European leaders try to maintain the friendship, they are racing to try to bolster their defense expenditures, cognizant that it would be nearly impossible to replace American military capabilities overnight.\n\nThey are meeting on Thursday in Paris to discuss Ukraine, and NATO foreign ministers meet early next month to discuss progress.\n\nThey are also scrambling to strike a trade deal with the United States, with the E.U. trade commissioner headed to Washington on Tuesday to talk with his American counterparts.\n\nBut with America’s increasingly hostile attitude toward Europe, the continent’s officials are contemplating a future where the prized relationship stretching across the Atlantic, a foundation upon which decades of relative peace and prosperity have been built, might never be the same.\n\nImage Soldiers from the United States, Lithuania and other NATO countries training in Germany this month. Credit... Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n“The international order is undergoing changes of a magnitude not seen since 1945,” Kaja Kallas, the top E.U. diplomat, said last week, echoing a line from the bloc’s defense preparedness plan, which is meant to help Europe to become more militarily independent.\n\nSplintering from the United States is an expensive prospect. The E.U. has already unveiled an initiative that could be worth 800 billion euros, about $865 billion, to help European nations achieve desired military spending levels.\n\nStill, the group chat leak underscores why a divorce may be necessary: The United States is not the reliable ally it once was, either rhetorically or practically.\n\nIt is highly unusual and possibly illegal for sensitive military plans to be discussed on a messaging app, rather than by a more secure means of communication.\n\nThat disregard for normal security procedures will “cause allies to be very reluctant to share analysis and intelligence,” said Ben Hodges, former commander of U.S. forces in Europe. Barring major change, people “will assume America can’t be trusted.”",

The Trump administration’s statement on Monday was its first extensive response to Columbia’s announcement about concessions three days earlier.\n\nThe changes are being made in response to Trump administration claims that antisemitism, particularly as a part of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, has been insufficiently checked on campus.\n\n“Columbia is demonstrating appropriate cooperation with the Trump administration’s requirements, and we look forward to a lasting resolution,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. She added that she had been communicating with Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, during the last few weeks and that she appreciated “her leadership and commitment to advance truly meaningful reforms on campus.”",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, is offering a new twist on President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan that touches a wide range of food industries.\n\nBabies are not ordinarily a fixture of closed-door White House meetings.\n\nBut when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, convened a group of women this month for a discussion on nutrition and other topics, a healthy-eating activist who calls herself “the Food Babe” was stunned to see President Trump’s press secretary with her eight-month-old on her lap.\n\nWhile several female cabinet secretaries looked on, the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, lamented that baby formula seems healthier in Europe than in the United States, where a recent study found that many varieties are laden with added sugars. Last week, Mr. Kennedy met with formula makers and announced a push to expand options for “safe, reliable and nutritious infant formula.”\n\nThe activist, Vani Hari, was thrilled. “It was such an amazing opportunity to see some solidification of the MAHA agenda across the different cabinets,” she said, using the initials for Mr. Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement. She called the event “a dream come true.”\n\nThe gathering of “MAHA Moms,” as Mr. Kennedy calls the corps of influencers and activists who follow him, was one of a series of choreographed events held in recent weeks by Mr. Kennedy, who occupies a highly unusual place in Washington. The scion of a famous Democratic family, his embrace of Mr. Trump, his tendency to spin wild theories out of kernels of truth and his promotion of what critics say is quack medicine have made him one of the most polarizing figures in the cabinet, even as he has developed a loyal following of his own.\n\nImage Vani Hari, who attended Mr. Kennedy’s nutrition summit at the White House, called the event “a dream come true.” Credit... Mike Belleme for The New York Times\n\nYet even some critics of Mr. Kennedy applaud his focus on obesity and healthy eating. He makes powerful industries and civil servants uncomfortable, holding forth from his newly powerful perch as head of the Department of Health and Human Services on an eclectic menu of topics — offering up alternative remedy ideas one day while blasting industrial food companies the next.\n\nNow companies and the government must contend with what might be called the Kennedy factor. So far, there has been little public pushback.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted information about vitamin A on its website after Mr. Kennedy promoted it as a measles treatment, to the consternation of public health officials who want him to advocate forcefully for vaccination.\n\nA fast-food chain announced it had “RFK-d” its French fries by ditching seed oil for beef tallow, a type of rendered beef fat that is similar to lard, despite cardiologists who say it poses risks to the heart.\n\nInfant formula makers, who came under scrutiny amid a shortage in 2022, said simply that they look forward to working with Mr. Kennedy. And after Mr. Kennedy instructed food executives to rid the food supply of artificial dyes, he followed up with a video message on social media: “They understand that they have a new sheriff in town.”\n\nMr. Kennedy declined an interview request.\n\nIt is far too soon to know whether Mr. Kennedy will make a real impact or whether these early steps are more posturing than substance. The Trump administration is taking actions that would seem to undermine his goals, such as disbanding an expert committee studying how to spare infants from a deadly bacteria that contributed to the decision in 2022 to temporarily shut down an Abbott Nutrition infant formula plant.\n\nMr. Kennedy could run into resistance from Congress. His disdain for the refined oils made from certain plants — seed oils like canola, soy and corn — and the ultra-processed foods that contain them has alarmed Republicans including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, whose farmer constituents receive subsidies from the government to grow the plants that produce the oils.\n\nMr. Kennedy opposes the subsidies. Mr. Grassley publicly instructed him to “leave agricultural practice regulations to the proper agencies,” including the Agriculture Department. Mr. Kennedy said he agreed.\n\n“That’s talk; I want to see what the action is,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said of Mr. Kennedy’s ambitions to remake the food supply. “And if the only action is getting colors out of the food supply, that’s not enough.”\n\nImage Infant formula makers, who came under scrutiny amid a shortage in 2022, said that they look forward to working with Mr. Kennedy. Credit... Gabriel V. Cárdenas for The New York Times\n\nPublic health experts still have serious concerns about Mr. Kennedy, whose skepticism of vaccines has colored his response to a Texas measles outbreak. Biomedical researchers say that if he really wanted to make America healthy, he would block Elon Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency from targeting the nation’s scientific enterprise by reducing jobs and cutting grants.\n\n“I think he has to take the blame for it; he’s destroying science in America,” said Dr. Walter C. Willett, a pioneer in nutrition research at Harvard’s School of Public Health.\n\nYet so long as he is not talking about vaccines, Mr. Kennedy’s ideas are winning cautious support in some surprising places. Dr. Willett said he agrees with Mr. Kennedy that the National Institutes of Health should rebalance its research portfolio to spend more studying ways to prevent disease. Dr. Nestle praised him for taking on the food industry.\n\n“When President Trump announced on Twitter that he was appointing R.F.K. Jr., he used the words industrial food complex,” she said. “I couldn’t believe that. It sounded just like me, and R.F.K. sounds just like me.”\n\nAt the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Kennedy was identified as one of the top spreaders of misinformation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which listed him as one of the “disinformation dozen.” His Instagram account was suspended in 2021, and reinstated in 2023 when he began his presidential bid.\n\nNow, as the health department leader, Mr. Kennedy has a much bigger platform from which he can shape American attitudes and beliefs.\n\nSome of his assertions, public health experts say, have been just plain wrong. Mr. Kennedy, for instance, told Sean Hannity of Fox News that immunity to the measles vaccine wanes over time and thus “older people are essentially unvaccinated.”\n\nImage Mr. Kennedy appears to be largely ignoring government experts on the measles outbreak in Texas. Credit... Desiree Rios for The New York Times\n\nThat contradicts the C.D.C. website, which says measles, mumps, rubella vaccines “usually protect people for life” against measles and rubella, but mumps immunity may decrease over time. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, agreed, saying, “The data continue to support that measles vaccine protects the vast majority of people lifelong.”\n\nLast week, Mr. Kennedy proposed banning cell phones in schools, an idea with bipartisan backing. But in addition to citing children’s mental health, he made another, unsubstantiated claim: that cell phones “produce electromagnetic radiation” that can cause cancer.\n\nSo far, Mr. Kennedy also appears to be largely ignoring government experts. He has not had any in-person or virtual briefings on measles from infectious disease experts at the C.D.C., according to two people familiar with the response to the Texas outbreak. Instead, he receives written reports from the agency.\n\nAn administration official said Mr. Kennedy meets daily with “career leadership” at H.H.S., the C.D.C.’s parent agency, to discuss matters including measles.\n\nHealth officials in Texas say Mr. Kennedy’s messages have been confusing. Dr. Katharine Wells, the director of public health in the city of Lubbock, said she is having trouble persuading parents to vaccinate their children because they think “vitamin A is protective, like the vaccine.”\n\nBut Kennedy allies were thrilled when the C.D.C. added a mention of vitamin A in its measles advisory on its website. Del Bigtree, Mr. Kennedy’s former communications director, lauded the move on a recent podcast. “My God,” he said, “do you see what a small step for mankind we just made?”\n\nMr. Kennedy is getting quiet advice from at least one person in the public health mainstream, Dr. Jeffrey D. Klausner, a professor at the University of Southern California who spent years with the C.D.C., including work on disease prevention in South Africa. Dr. Klausner, a neighbor of Mr. Kennedy’s in Los Angeles, said he is working to identify new members of the C.D.C.’s vaccine advisory committee, a panel Mr. Kennedy says is rife with conflicts of interest.\n\nHe said Mr. Kennedy has given him just one criteria: “He wants highly credentialed, unbiased people who can look at the science objectively.”\n\nDespite his promise of “radical transparency,” Mr. Kennedy is offering Americans a highly curated version of himself. Like Mr. Trump, he speaks to the public largely through social media and Fox News.\n\nIn a sense, Mr. Kennedy is offering a new twist on Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan; he wants United States customers to be able to buy Froot Loops, the colored sugary cereal, with the same ingredients — dyes made from colored blueberries and carrots, instead of chemicals — used in Canada, and French fries to be cooked like they are in Europe.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s crusade against seed oils has caught the eye of executives at Steak ’n Shake, which says it will now cook its fries in Mr. Kennedy’s preferred frying agent, beef tallow — even though nutrition experts say there is no evidence that tallow, a saturated fat akin to butter, is healthier than seed oils.\n\n“He says he’s following the science,” Dr. Willett said. “If you look at the scientific evidence, that doesn’t take you to the conclusion that beef tallow is better than seed oils.”\n\nImage So long as he is not talking about vaccines, Mr. Kennedy’s ideas are winning cautious support in some surprising places. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times\n\nAn Indianapolis-based restaurant chain, Steak ’n Shake announced the switch this month on social media with a picture of a ball cap in Mr. Trump’s signature MAGA red that declared, “Make Frying Oil Tallow Again.” Mr. Kennedy, who otherwise appears to be no fan of French fries, traveled to a Florida Steak ’n Shake with Mr. Hannity, of Fox, and picked away at a basket of them for the cameras.\n\n“We’re very grateful to them for R.F.K.-ing their French fries,” he said.\n\nMs. Hari, the healthy-eating activist, called the Steak n’ Shake announcement “an interesting example of how we can make incremental changes to the food system to make it better than it was.” She said she intends to push Mr. Kennedy to make fast-food chains post all of their ingredients online.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s inner circle seems to be divided into two camps: those like Mr. Bigtree, who are drawn to him because of his stance on vaccination, and those like Ms. Hari and Calley Means, an author and health care entrepreneur, whose focus is nutrition and chronic disease. Mr. Means recently joined the White House as a special government employee to help carry out Mr. Kennedy’s agenda.\n\nMr. Kennedy has also inspired a MAHA movement in the states. On Monday, the governor of West Virginia signed legislation banning certain food dyes from school lunches.\n\nLast week, Mr. Means was in Arizona, along with other Kennedy allies, to speak in favor of a “Make Arizona Healthy Again” bill that would ban certain chemicals from school lunch programs and prohibit candy, soda, chips and other junk foods from being purchased with the federal nutrition dollars formerly known as “food stamps.”\n\nHelene Leeds, who with her daughter founded Step It Up, a weight loss program, also testified, and was identified as a “MAHA Mom” by the MAHA Alliance, a group that backs Mr. Kennedy’s agenda. The moniker gave her pause.\n\n“It’s new for me to be called that,” she said. “I mean, absolutely, I stand for health in everything that I do.” She added: “I also look at myself as a MAHA leader.”\n\nAfter the MAHA Moms meeting, the White House posted video of Mr. Kennedy and some of his guests on social media stumbling over how to pronounce food ingredients like riboflavin. Mr. Kennedy posted photos with a message to the women: “You got me where I am today, and I will not let you down.”",

        "content": "He said experts were evaluating how the shell could be fixed — and even if it could be. Workers would have to close the initial 540-square-foot hole from the drone. But they would also have to seal up the small holes created by workers trying to extinguish the fire. They would have to somehow repair the damaged membrane and insulation and any damaged internal structures. And they would have to reduce the humidity that resulted from hundreds of workers spraying high-powered hoses inside the structure.\n\nDoing that where the confinement shell now sits is probably not possible, experts said, because workers would be exposed to high radiation levels from within. Moving the structure and then fixing it would also be challenging. What would protect the already unstable sarcophagus while that work was carried out?\n\n“Full restoration of the facility is practically impossible,” Mr. Siryi said. “To bring it as close as possible to its original state — well, that would likely require hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nMr. Schmieman said repairing the structure, or building a new one, would be extremely costly. He suggested temporarily covering the holes — with something akin to duct tape — so the ventilation system inside could start reducing humidity. “Don’t immediately look for a quick, permanent solution for the large number of holes in the building, but look for a quick way to reduce corrosion,” he said.\n\nOne thing that might help, he said: drones. Largely because of the war, Ukraine has developed drone technology faster than almost any other country. Small drones — much smaller than the Shahed 136 that pierced the structure — could perhaps evaluate the damage inside the shell, and even help with fixing it.",

        "content": "A Signal leak\n\nBy far the biggest story of the day is The Atlantic’s stunning revelation that Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, discussed sensitive Yemen bombing plans with other senior Trump administration officials on a messaging app — in a group text that mistakenly included that publication’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nThe incident has raised serious questions about whether the group chat violated laws including the Espionage Act and endangered troops. But it’s also reminiscent of how Wall Street firms got into hot water for similar reasons. They had to pay more than $2 billion for doing the kind of off-channel messaging that Hegseth and others are being sharply criticized for now.\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC,” Hegseth wrote at one point, referring to operational security, during a group chat on Signal, according to Goldberg. The defense secretary then revealed detailed war plans on the same channel. Goldberg, who had been added by Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, said he didn’t include the most sensitive details from the chat in his article.\n\nWhile Goldberg writes that he was initially unsure whether the whole thing was a joke or a misinformation campaign, the launching of airstrikes on targets in Yemen eventually persuaded him that it was real. (Waltz had responded with emojis to the bombing details: “👊🇺🇸🔥”.)",

        "content": "“Ha sido un reto para mí”, añadió. “Pero, al fin y al cabo, es injusto”.\n\nSegún la Constitución estadounidense, las personas que se enfrentan a penas de cárcel tienen derecho a un abogado —pagado por el gobierno si no pueden costearse el suyo propio— y a un proceso judicial justo y eficiente. Pero estas protecciones son débiles, especialmente en las zonas rurales de Estados Unidos, según han demostrado algunos estudios. En Texas, uno de los estados que menos gastan en la defensa de personas de escasos recursos, el Times encontró ejemplos recientes de personas retenidas más allá de los plazos sin cargos ni abogados en seis condados rurales.\n\nDestacó el condado de Maverick. Se encuentra en una de las regiones más pobres del estado, y muchos acusados no pueden pagar un abogado; algunos pasan meses en la cárcel porque no pueden pagar a un fiador 500 dólares o menos. Sin embargo, en las dos últimas décadas, los auditores estatales han observado repetidamente que el condado no proporcionaba adecuadamente un abogado a las personas que no pueden pagarlo. En 2023, cuando más de 240 acusados de delitos menores solicitaron representación, el juez del condado solo nombró abogado en un puñado de casos, según muestran los registros. No obstante, el estado no ha impuesto consecuencias.\n\nSin nadie que les oriente, los acusados entran en un sistema de justicia desarticulado en el que puede ser muy difícil averiguar por qué alguien está en la cárcel, si es que hay alguna razón. En los expedientes de delitos menores casi siempre faltan documentos clave. Los expedientes de delitos graves no suelen abrirse hasta más de un año después de la detención del acusado. En ocasiones, la cárcel dijo que no tenía constancia de personas a pesar de que las que había retenido recientemente durante meses.\n\nEn respuesta al trabajo periodístico del Times, abogados defensores y estudiosos del derecho constitucional calificaron las prácticas del condado de “atroces”, “kafkianas” y “nada propias de un sistema penal”.",

It isn’t clear, however, which agency or entity would administer the grants if the Education Department were to go away.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump said that the Small Business Administration would “immediately” take over the federal student loan portfolio. The Student Borrower Protection Center called his idea “illegal, unserious, and a distraction.”\n\nGiven the enormity of the loan program, any quick transfer seems highly unlikely. Until Congress or federal courts get involved — and both may happen before long — the application process for financial aid and loans won’t change. The FAFSA, short for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, has been working better so far this application season after a rough redesign of the application. But it’s not clear how recent Education Department layoffs will affect the process.\n\nThe biggest wild card may be the colleges themselves and what sorts of grants and scholarships they’ll be giving out. Many schools are suspending hiring to save money and fretting over a possible decline in international students, who may fear coming to the United States right now.",

The Trump administration is taking actions that would seem to undermine his goals, such as disbanding an expert committee studying how to spare infants from a deadly bacteria that contributed to the decision in 2022 to temporarily shut down an Abbott Nutrition infant formula plant.\n\nMr. Kennedy could run into resistance from Congress. His disdain for the refined oils made from certain plants — seed oils like canola, soy and corn — and the ultra-processed foods that contain them has alarmed Republicans including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, whose farmer constituents receive subsidies from the government to grow the plants that produce the oils.\n\nMr. Kennedy opposes the subsidies. Mr. Grassley publicly instructed him to “leave agricultural practice regulations to the proper agencies,” including the Agriculture Department. Mr. Kennedy said he agreed.\n\n“That’s talk; I want to see what the action is,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said of Mr. Kennedy’s ambitions to remake the food supply. “And if the only action is getting colors out of the food supply, that’s not enough.”",

        "title": "Flannery O’Connor at 100: should we still read her?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A month before she died aged 39, on 3 August 1964, of complications from the autoimmune disease lupus, the American writer Flannery O’Connor wrote from her home in Milledgeville, Georgia to a regular correspondent, the academic and nun Sister Mariella Gable: “The wolf, I’m afraid, is inside tearing up the place.”\n\nThe “wolf” that O’Connor refers to is her illness, the name of which derives from the Latin. The disease can be mild, but in its worst form it is systemic, causing not only inflammation, chronic fatigue, muscle weakness and skin rashes, but also permanent tissue damage. In her last years, O’Connor could only move around by means of crutches, tending to her beloved pet peacocks. “I can write for one hour a day, and my, my, do I like my one hour. I eat it up like it was filet mignon.”\n\nBefore diagnosis at the age of 25, O’Connor had been a talented graduate student with an MFA from the prestigious University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and had completed a coveted Yaddo artists’ colony residency in upstate New York. A draft of her first novel, published as Wise Blood in 1952, and filmed by John Huston in 1979, won a prize; she had become involved in the New York City literary scene, acquired an agent, and was close friends with the poet Robert Lowell and others of his circle. She also lived for a while in Connecticut with the classicist Robert Fitzgerald and his wife, Sally, who would go on to edit of The Habit of Being (1979), a vast volume of O’Connor’s correspondence. Venerable publisher Robert Giroux had her in his sights early on: he remained her editor throughout her life.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘The wolf is inside’ … O’Connor in 1952, with her novel Wise Blood. Photograph: Apic/Getty Images\n\nHer illness meant that in 1951 O’Connor moved back to what she termed the “Christ-haunted” south, to live with and be cared for by her widowed mother, Regina Cline O’Connor. They eventually settled at Andalusia, the O’Connor family summer home, a working farm just outside Milledgeville, Georgia, presided over by a large white classic Southern house straight out of a Tennessee Wiliams play, complete with veranda for rocking chairs. It that is now a museum preserving O’Connor’s work and legacy. The land was formerly a cotton plantation; O’Connor satirised her upbringing in the Jim Crow-era segregated south in sardonic stories of hypocritical, racist and godless southerners, while at times revealing unpalatable personal views in her letters – “the habit of bigotry”, as critic Paul Elie wrote, in a 2020 New Yorker essay titled “How Racist Was Flannery O’Connor?”.\n\nMary Flannery O’Connor was born on 25 March 1925 in Savannah, the oldest city in Georgia, the only child of real estate agent Edward Francis O’Connor and Regina Cline, who was from an old southern family. Of Irish descent, the O’Connors’ Catholicism made them a minority in the heavily Protestant south. Her first taste of fame was at five years old, on a Pathé newsreel, featuring a chicken that “Mary O’Connor” had taught to walk backwards. “I was just there to assist the chicken, but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been anticlimax,” she joked. The determined chicken, walking backwards to go forward, is a tempting metaphor for O’Connor’s own endurance. It instilled in her a “love affair” with birds that seemed to transcend most human interactions. Ever self-deprecating, she described herself as a “pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I’ll-bite-you complex”, an attitude apparent in her acerbic, droll letters, her wry fiction and the cartoons she drew for her student newspaper at Georgia Women’s College (now Georgia State University), where she obtained a BA in sociology and literature in 1945. By this time O’Connor’s father had died, in early 1941, of the lupus that his daughter would inherit. Mother and daughter were left to their ambiguous, interdependent relationship. Notably, none of O’Connor’s letters to Regina has ever been published.\n\nO’Connor’s novelistic ambitions would not entirely fold with the progression of her illness, but ironically it was her limited energy that made her into one of the most original short story writers of the 20th century, her acute and disturbing moral vision of humanity driven by a devout, if unconventionally expressed, Catholic faith. “When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little … when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock – to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures,” she wrote.\n\nO’Connor’s frequently brutal fiction, with its distorted, unnatural characters, is usually categorised as “southern gothic”, a term initially coined dismissively by the novelist Ellen Glasgow in 1935 to describe the “backwoods” and “eccentric” fiction of writers such as William Faulkner. Faulkner was undoubtedly a great influence on O’Connor (and he admired Wise Blood), as was master of the grotesque Edgar Allan Poe, the Catholic French novelist François Mauriac, and her near-contemporary Katherine Anne Porter. O’Connor’s own influence can be traced in later writers such as Shirley Jackson, CE Morgan and Joyce Carol Oates.\n\nView image in fullscreen Maya Hawke as the author in 2023 biopic Wildcat. Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy\n\nHer characters hover somewhere between victim and villain: their fates are ordained; they do not appear to have free will. In what is probably her best known and most anthologised story, A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1953), a prattling, controlling grandmother meets her appalling match in the Misfit, the homicidal leader of an escaped convict gang. The elderly woman and her son’s young family – each objectionable in their own way – are shot dead in turn by the gang when they crash their car on a road trip through Georgia – all because the grandmother insisted on having one last look at a house she remembers from her past. “The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee … Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Her reputation has been clouded since that 2020 New Yorker essay, although it has been argued that Elie’s disclosures were not new; the letters have been in the public domain since the late 70s. Hilton Als wrote of her Black characters in 2001: “She didn’t use them as vessels of sympathy or scorn; she simply – and complexly – drew from life.” Yet a major biography by Brad Gooch (Flannery O’Connor: A Life, 2009) admits her to be, in private, as Joy Williams put it in a New York Times review, “a connoisseur of racial jokes”.\n\nO’Connor could be perversely contradictory, arguing both for and against integration, while lampooning racist white characters in stories like Revelation and Everything That Rises Must Converge. It was this deeply problematic aspect that caused director Ethan Hawke to hesitate over filming recent biopic Wildcat, which stars his actor daughter Maya as Flannery, alongside Laura Linney as Regina. Hawke and Linney also play most of the roles in the dramatisation of a selection of the stories. The performances are compelling, and Hawke ably transforms into O’Connor – bushy hair and eyebrows, steely spectacles, tell-tale lupus “butterfly” rash blazing across her cheeks. Disappointingly Wildcat sidesteps the question of the author’s racism, while delving into the mystery and conflict of her religious belief. In a 1959 letter she wrote: “What people don’t realise is how much religion costs. They think faith is a big electric blanket, when of course it is the cross.” O’Connor defiantly carried that cross to the end.",

        "content": "An appeals court judge claimed on Monday that Nazis were given more rights to contest their removal from the United States during the second world war than Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration.\n\nThe comments came during a contentious hearing shortly after a lower court thwarted the Trump administration’s effort to deport the immigrants under a roughly 225-year-old war powers law.\n\nJudge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government’s attempt to vacate restraining orders protecting Venezuelans accused of gang ties from deportation, instead ruling that individuals must receive hearings before their removal.\n\n“The named Plaintiffs dispute they are members of Tren de Aragua; they may not be deported until a court decides the merits of their challenge,” Boasberg wrote.\n\nLater on Monday, US circuit judge Patricia Millett questioned the government lawyer Drew Ensign on whether Venezuelans targeted for removal under the Alien Enemies Act had time to contest the Trump administration’s assertion that they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang before they were put on planes and deported to El Salvador.\n\n“Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,” Millett said, to which Ensign responded: “We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy.”\n\nThe clash is rooted in Donald Trump’s 15 March proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which permits deportation of foreign nationals during wars or “invasions”.

His attorney, Lindsay Toczylowski, went on MSNBC last week and claimed he had “disappeared” despite having a scheduled immigration court appearance, after officials misinterpreted his tattoos as gang symbols.\n\nAccording to Boasberg’s order, five Venezuelan immigrants had secured emergency relief – hours before the Trump administration said it would use the Alien Enemies Act – fearing immediate deportation without a chance to contest their alleged gang membership. Several of the migrants who filed the lawsuit argue they actually fled Venezuela to escape the gang.\n\nTrump has called Boasberg, an Obama-appointed judge, a “radical left lunatic” and called for his impeachment, prompting the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, to issue a rare rebuke.\n\nBoasberg explained on Monday that his orders did not block normal immigration enforcement, noting the administration had already designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, allowing deportations through standard channels.\n\nLawyers for Trump have asked the appeals court to lift Boasberg’s ruling that blocked the administration’s use of the wartime act. If the appeals court rules in their favor, that could give a free hand for the Trump administration to use it to deport any immigrant it accuses of being a gang member without the standard due process owed to accused persons in the US.",

        "content": "A Japanese man wrongly convicted of murder who was the world’s longest-serving death row inmate has been awarded $1.4m in compensation, an official has said.\n\nThe payout represents 12,500 yen ($83) for each day of the 46 years that Iwao Hakamada spent in detention, most of it on death row when each day could have been his last.\n\nThe former boxer, now 89, was exonerated in 2024 of a 1966 quadruple murder after a tireless campaign by his sister and others.\n\nThe Shizuoka District Court, in a decision dated Monday, said that “the claimant shall be granted 217,362,500,000 yen”, a court spokesperson told AFP.\n\nThe same court ruled in September that Hakamada was not guilty in a retrial and that police had tampered with evidence.\n\nHakamada had suffered “inhumane interrogations meant to force a statement (confession)“ that he later withdrew, the court said at the time. The final amount is a record for compensation of this kind, local media said.\n\nBut Hakamada’s legal team has said the money falls short of the pain he suffered.\n\nDecades of detention – with the threat of execution constantly looming – took a major toll on Hakamada’s mental health, his lawyers have said, describing him as “living in a world of fantasy”.\n\nHakamada was the fifth death row inmate granted a retrial in Japan’s postwar history. All four previous cases also resulted in exonerations.",

        "content": "A long investigation into the mysterious death in 2023 of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested the boy’s grandparents on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe death of Émile Soleil, who was two and a half when he went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, has remained unexplained even after the discovery of his skull and teeth by a walker just over a mile from the village nine months after his disappearance.\n\nProsecutors at the time said the cause of his death, which shocked the country, could have been “a fall, manslaughter or murder”. Police later found more bones and items of the boy’s clothing.\n\nÉmile was at his grandparents’ summer home in the small hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Two neighbours last saw him walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000ft) up in the French Alps. His mother and father were absent on the day of his disappearance.\n\nSome media outlets had focused on the role of the boy’s grandfather, who was questioned in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school, but police had considered his involvement as only one of many possible hypotheses explaining the boy’s death.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning the grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of “voluntary homicide”, the chief prosecutor of Aix-en-Provence, Jean-Luc Blachon, said in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.\n\nContacted by AFP the couple’s lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, said she had no comment, having “only just heard” about the development.\n\nTwo other members of the family were also arrested, prosecutors said. Their identity was not revealed.\n\nSpeculation that a development in the case was imminent resurfaced earlier this month when investigators returned to the village. Tuesday’s arrests were the result of fact-finding “over recent months”, the prosecutor told reporters, adding that forensic police were examining “several spots in the area”.\n\nA funeral mass for the toddler was held in February this year in the presence of several hundreds of mourners. Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying “the period of silence must yield to the period of truth”, adding: “We need to understand, we need to know.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "1. The human factor Organisations that rely on security protocols being enforced also rely by their nature on a shared sense of common responsibility. The fact that 18 of Donald Trump’s most senior officials and advisers, including several with a military background who have served overseas and should have been aware of operational security requirements, used an app not approved by the US government for sharing sensitive information will be seen as descriptive of their character and the nature of Washington’s current administration. The displays of arrogance, recklessness and a belief that the normal rules do not apply will contribute to profiles of senior US decision-makers. Intelligence agencies will also be thinking about the security culture around such figures as the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth – who has faced allegations of sexual assault and heavy drinking – and what opportunities that presents. Outrage after White House accidentally texts journalist war plans: ‘Huge screw-up’ Read more Hegseth’s assurances in the chat group about guaranteeing “100% Opsec – operations security” and subsequent assertions of no wrongdoing will be seen as further evidence of exploitable flaws.\n\n2. The medium is a message The fact that a commercial chat service was used will not have gone unnoticed. While Signal is end-to-end encrypted, if it is used on insecure devices, those devices can be targeted by malware, for instance. Conversations of this kind should be conducted in a secure, compartmentalised information facility (SCIF) or via a similar system designed for conversations where high security is required. If critical information is being exchanged outside formal channels, it suggests that numerous technical vulnerabilities exist that can be targeted. Hostile actors – not least China, which is viewed as particularly aggressive in its hacking efforts – will be looking for what other unauthorised and unsecured methods of communication are being used.\n\n3. The known unknown We know from the Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting of his presence in the group that there were decision-makers his publication did not identify and information about the attack plans that he believed was too sensitive to disclose. The fact that this unreported information was shared insecurely means that it will also need to be treated as having been compromised, regardless of whether it has been accessed beyond Goldberg and the Atlantic’s staff.\n\n4. How the Trump administration works Perhaps one of the most significant elements in the leak is that we now have a detailed insight into the organisational chart for the Trump administration’s most sensitive military deliberations. While the identities of many of those in the chat group are unsurprising given their roles, their individual interactions with each other give clues to the hierarchy that exists. Foreign governments will also be interested in what the chat indicates about disagreements within the group, not least the somewhat surprising revelation of dissent by the vice-president, JD Vance, over the timing of the attack, and his view that Trump may not be aware of inconsistencies in his own policies.",

        "content": "The shoes and backpacks, arranged in neat rows, make it look almost like a school cloakroom. But the ranch where they were found is an alleged training camp and killing site for Mexico’s Jalisco cartel.\n\nThe discovery by activists of underground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what they call an “extermination camp” has horrified Mexico, sparking protests across the country.\n\nIt is the highest-profile such case in years – and has forced the spotlight back on to Mexico’s crisis of forced disappearances related to organised crime. Across the country, more than 120,000 people are registered as missing.\n\n“These places exist all over the country,” said María Guadalupe Aguilar, founder of Familias Unidas por Nuestros Desaparecidos, who has been searching for her son José Luis Arana since 17 January 2011. “Mexico is full of mass graves.”\n\nAuthorities have offered few answers about the camp, which was found near the town of Teuchitlán, 60km (37 miles) from Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest city.\n\nThey say it may have been operated by the Jalisco cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful organised crime groups, but have yet to say how many people died there, and none of the remains have been identified.\n\nOn Wednesday, federal attorney general Alejandro Gertz said the initial investigation had been riddled with omissions, pointing the blame at local authorities.\n\nAlthough the ranch was secured by state authorities in September last year, the ovens and more than 1,000 items of clothing were only reported earlier this month when Warrior Searchers of Jalisco, a collective of relatives of missing people, went there after receiving an anonymous tip. Within a few hours, they found human remains.\n\nView image in fullscreen Shoes found at the ranch in Teuchitlán, Jalisco state, Mexico, on March 11. Photograph: AP\n\nGertz said his office is exploring whether failures in the initial investigation were due to incompetence or collusion with organised crime.\n\nAs shock waves from the case passed through Mexico, several people claiming to be survivors came forward with testimonies, describing how they were lured to the ranch with fake offers of work.\n\nTheir accounts coincide with previous reports of forced recruitment in Jalisco, in which young people responded to job adverts online before being kidnapped and held in dire conditions as they were both victimised and forced to victimise others to survive.\n\n“The training, the abuse, it’s designed to dehumanise them, to strip them of themselves,” said Alejandra Guillén, a journalist and academic at Iteso, a university in Guadalajara, who investigates forced disappearances.\n\n“They promised them work and a salary and none of it was true: they began to train them to be sicarios [killers],” said Aguilar, who went to the ranch last week to help classify the clothes.\n\nPhotos of every item of clothing have since been put online. Relatives of the disappeared across Mexico have pored over the images. Some have travelled to Jalisco.\n\n“Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” Indira Navarro, one of the activists who discovered the site, told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life.”\n\nTraining camps and clandestine ovens, often found by search collectives, have been documented across Jalisco for years – including several just a short distance from the ranch.\n\n“Just this year they even found one in the same municipality where they freed 36 people,” said Anna Karolina Chimiak, from the Centre of Justice for Peace and Development, a civil society group in Jalisco.\n\nBut it was the image of the shoes, with its echoes of the 20th century’s darkest chapters, that meant this discovery broke through.\n\nView image in fullscreen A protester during a national day of mourning outside the national palace in Mexico City, Mexico, on 15 March. Photograph: Sáshenka Gutiérrez/EPA\n\nIt remains unclear what became of their owners. But incinerating bodies is a “known practice” in Jalisco, said Chimiak.\n\nIt is the latest, cruellest evolution of forced disappearances, said Aguilar: “With ashes, the hope of identifying them is lost.”\n\nIn response to the scandal, Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, announced measures to strengthen laws around missing people. She promised the discovery would be investigated fully, unlike high-profile cases under previous governments, such as the 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa who were disappeared in 2014.\n\n“There will not be impunity,” said Sheinbaum. “We will never hide anything.”\n\nHowever, Sheinbaum has also claimed that certain media and opposition figures were weaponising the case to attack her government, and pointed to an alleged bot campaign on social media.\n\nMeanwhile authorities have cast doubt on the idea that there were clandestine ovens on the ranch, despite acknowledging the presence of burnt remains.\n\n“It is not a setup, it is not an invention,” responded Warrior Searchers of Jalisco, the collective that found the underground ovens. “It is the harsh reality that we have found in Teuchitlán.”\n\n“It feels more and more like there is a deliberate intent to generate a narrative that nothing happened there,” said Chimiak.\n\nThe crisis of forced disappearances in Mexico casts an enduring shadow on Sheinbaum’s pledge to reduce violence in Mexico, which was one of the failings of her predecessor and ally, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\nAlthough official data shows a reduction in the number of homicides in recent years, the number of disappearances has risen inexorably.\n\nJalisco alone has almost 15,000 missing people. It is also the stronghold of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration.\n\nThe great number of disappearances in Jalisco might reflect a mix of powerful economic interests, proximity to drug trafficking infrastructure like the port of Manzanillo, and a history of such violence dating back to the Guadalajara cartel and beyond, said Guillén.\n\nAguilar offered a more straightforward explanation: “Maybe it’s because we are in the hands of the most powerful cartel in the world.”",

        "content": "It was shortly after Palestinian residents had finished their daily Ramadan fast that dozens of masked Israeli settlers entered the West Bank village of Susiya, according to witnesses.\n\nSome of the settlers were armed with batons, others had knives and one of them was holding an M16 rifle, the witnesses told the Guardian. Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village.\n\nMinutes later, the settlers walked straight over to the house of Hamdan Ballal, one of the four directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land that documented the destruction of villages in the West Bank – a film condemned in Israel and described by the country’s culture minister as “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.\n\nThe settlers started throwing stones against his house, witnesses said, and chased Ballal to his house, beating him and eventually handing him over to the military. Handcuffed and blindfolded by the soldiers, Ballal, bleeding from his head, was moved to a military vehicle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Ballal and two other Palestinians were released from a police station in Kiryat Arba, in the occupied West Bank, where they had spent the night on the floor while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.\n\n0:56 Moment Israeli settlers attack activists in West Bank – video\n\nThe Guardian has reviewed videos and photographs captured by activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV) who were on the scene, spoken to witnesses – including Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s directors – and contacted the Israel Defense Forces in order to shed light on an incident that sparked anger across the world.\n\nFive Jewish American activists from CJNV who tried to help Ballal as he was being beaten by the settlers said that, before the masked attackers entered the village, another group of settlers, mostly teenagers, had interrupted the celebrations for the break of the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, by shouting, pushing and swinging punches at Palestinians.\n\n“They were eventually followed by the masked settlers who started throwing stones,” a statement from CJNV said.\n\nVideo provided by CJNV showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.\n\n“They destroyed our car with stones and slashed one of the tires; all of the windows and windshields were broken,” one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the Guardian.\n\nMeanwhile, another group of settlers went to Ballal’s home, throwing stones at his car and house.\n\nBallal’s wife heard her husband being beaten outside and screaming: “I’m dying.”\n\nWitnesses said an Israeli police car arrived on the scene, but officers “refused to get out of the vehicle and intervene”. Instead, they began interrogating the Jewish American activists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ballal being detained by the Israeli military near his home. Photograph: Raviv Rose/AP\n\n“The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene,” said Adra. “While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.\n\n“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him,” he added. “Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”\n\nMembers of the activist group then entered Ballal’s house and saw blood on the floor, which a family member said was spilled when he was hit on the head.\n\nInjured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal was moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle.\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the IDF said there had been a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.\n\n“Last night [Monday], several terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving mutual rock-hurling between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene,” the statement said.\n\n“IDF and Israeli police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces.\n\n“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel police.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Ballal’s car after the attack. Photograph: Handout\n\nOn Tuesday, Ballal’s lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said he was released with the two other Palestinians detained during the incident, Nasser Shreiteh and Khaled Muhammad Shnaran.\n\nAssociated Press journalists saw the director leaving the police station where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.\n\nThis is not the first time that directors and crew members of No Other Land, and Palestinian residents of Susiya, have been attacked by settlers. CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.\n\n‘‘We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us,” said Adra. “This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment.”\n\nNo Other Land, which won the Oscar for best documentary feature film, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with the Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.\n\nView image in fullscreen A still from No Other Land. Photograph: Antipode Films\n\nThe film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, with Miami Beach proposing ending the lease of a cinema that screened the documentary. It has struggled to find a backer in the US and has instead been self-distributed.\n\nLast February, Adra was also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.\n\n“We risked our life to film,” he said, adding that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank in 1967, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centres.\n\nThe Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.\n\nDuring the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians, as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "title": "Stunning Signal leak reveals depths of Trump administration’s loathing of Europe",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "If Europe wasn’t already on notice, the extraordinary leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen was another sign that it has a target on its back.\n\nThe administration officials gave Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic a front-row seat to the planning for the strike against the Houthis – a stunning intelligence leak that has caused anger against Republicans who called for criminal investigations against Hillary Clinton and others for playing fast and loose with sensitive information.\n\nOn the face of it, the strike against the Houthis had far more to do with the administration’s policies on protecting maritime trade and containing Iran than its concerns about Europe freeloading on US defense spending and military prowess.\n\nBut Vance appears determined to push that angle as a reason to postpone the strike.\n\n“I think we are making a mistake,” wrote Vance, adding that while only 3% of US trade goes through the Suez canal, 40% of European trade does. “There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary,” he added. “The strongest reason to do this is, as [Trump] said, to send a message.”\n\nVance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).\n\nIt was during this policy discussion, Goldberg wrote, that he was convinced that he was reading remarks by the real Vance, as well as defense secretary Pete Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, and senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nThen Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump’s saying that the strike would undermine the president’s Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.\n\n“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nThose designated on the call also reflect the vice-president’s growing clout in foreign policymaking circles. Vance named Andy Baker, his national security advisor who helped lead the transition team at the Pentagon, as his representative. Hegseth named Dan Caldwell, a leading proponent of “restraint” in the exercise of US foreign power abroad to protect Europe and counter rivals like Russia, indicating the Vance team’s presence at high levels of the Pentagon as well.\n\nAt heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance’s views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. But Vance appears far more confrontational and principled in his antipathy toward the transatlantic alliance, and has attacked European leaders for backing values that he says are not aligned with the US.\n\nThat makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies. Another European diplomat said: “He is very dangerous for Europe … maybe the most [dangerous] in the administration.” Another said he was “obsessed” with driving a wedge between Europe and the US.\n\nBack on the chat some sought – carefully – to talk Vance down. Hegseth said the strike would promote “core” American values including freedom of navigation and pre-establish deterrence. But he said the strikes could wait, if desired. Waltz, a foreign policy traditionalist, said: “It will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.” But he agreed that the administration sought to “compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans”.\n\n“If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance replied. Hegseth agreed that “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” But, he added, “we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nMiller, the Trump confidant, effectively ended the conversation by saying that the president had been clear. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.”\n\nBroadly, the administration’s policies on Europe are coming into focus. And there are few stepping up to voice backing for Nato or for Europe writ large. On a podcast interview this weekend, the senior Trump envoy Steve Witkoff mused about the potential for the Gulf economies to replace those of Europe. “It could be much bigger than Europe. Europe is dysfunctional today,” he said.\n\nTucker Carlson, the host and another Trump confidant, agreed. “It would be good for the world because Europe is dying,” he said.",

        "content": "The US postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, who said earlier this month that he had asked the government efficiency team led by Elon Musk for assistance with a number of issues, is resigning effective on Monday, the agency said.\n\nDeJoy, who has headed the agency since 2020, in February said he had asked the US Postal Service (USPS) governing board to identify his successor but had given no indication in recent days that he planned to step down abruptly.\n\nDonald Trump said in February that he was considering merging the United States Postal Service with the commerce department, a move Democrats said would violate federal law.\n\n“Much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory,” DeJoy said in a statement, adding that the deputy postmaster general, Doug Tulino, would head the agency until the postal board names a permanent successor. They have hired a search firm, he added.\n\nDeJoy has led a dramatic effort to restructure USPS over the last five years, including cutting forecast cumulative losses over a decade to $80bn from $160bn. The outgoing postal chief has used tactics similar to the Musk-led “department of government efficiency” (Doge) team, including shrinking the workforce and canceling or renegotiating contracts.\n\nTwo media outlets reported last month that Trump was preparing to issue an executive order to fire the USPS’s board of governors.\n\nMusk said this month he thought USPS should be privatized.\n\nUSPS, an agency with 635,000 employees that lost $9.5bn last year, has been exempt from Doge-directed federal employee reductions.\n\nThe White House did not immediately comment on whether it had any involvement in DeJoy’s departure. Last week, the White House forced out the chief executive of the US passenger railroad service Amtrak.",

The documentary, which has Palestinian and Israeli directors, focuses on the steady forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Masafer Yatta, a region in the occupied West Bank targeted by Israeli forces. The film’s co-directors are Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. It highlights the parallel realities in which the two friends live - Abraham with his yellow Israeli number plate that lets him travel anywhere, while Adra is confined to a territory that only ever gets smaller for Palestinians, despite it being their homeland. Despite the critical acclaim, the film could not find distribution in the US and was self-distributed instead. “I believe it’s clear that it’s for political reasons,” Abraham told Deadline about the lack of formal distribution. In an acceptance speech after winning an Oscar, Abraham said: We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed. When I look at Basel, I see my brother but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military law that destroys his life and he cannot control. There is a different path. A political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say as I’m here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. And why? Can’t you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel’s people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It’s not too late for life, for the living.

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Ballal, one of four co-directors of the No Other Land documentary, made the announcement. It is unclear when Ballal will be released. Tsemel said on Tuesday that her client and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack. She had earlier said they were accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations they deny. Ballal had his house in the Israeli-occupied West Bank surrounded by settlers during yesterday’s attack in the village of Susya, the Center for Jewish Nonviolence group (CJNV) said. Share Updated at 09.20 EDT\n\n2h ago 08.52 EDT Israel says Al Jazeera journalist it killed in Gaza was Hamas 'terrorist sniper' On Tuesday, Israel confirmed it had killed an Al Jazeera employee in the Gaza Strip, accusing the journalist, Hussam Shabat, of being a “sniper terrorist” for Hamas, the AFP news agency reports. Al Jazeera said Shabat was killed on Monday by an Israeli strike on his vehicle in northern Gaza. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the attack as part of a “massacre of journalists” in the Palestinian territory. A joint statement released by Israeli military and Shin Bet internal security agency said that forces had “eliminated... a sniper terrorist from the Beit Hanun Battalion of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was also employed as a journalist by Al Jazeera”. Referring to Shabat, the Israeli statement that said security forces had “in October 2024... exposed the terrorist’s direct affiliation with the military wing of the Hamas terrorist organisation”. Israel has repeatedly accused Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza of being “terrorist operatives” affiliated with groups like Hamas and has suspended the network’s broadcasts. The network vehemently denies these accusations. Jonathan Dagher, head of the RSF’s Middle East desk, said in a statement that Israel’s accusations from 2024 “can in no way justify his murder, as they are based on documents that in no way constitute that the journalist had any affiliation” with Hamas’s armed wing. According to the Israeli statement, “internal Hamas documents” proved Shabat had taken part in military training conducted by the militant group’s Beit Hanun Battalion in 2019. Al Jazeera denies Israel’s accusations and says Israel systematically targets its staff in Gaza.

In a post on Telegram, provincial authorities reported a provisional toll of “five people killed in the Israeli bombardment of the town of Kuwayya... west of Daraa”. In an earlier post, we reported that the Israeli military said it had launched attacks on the Syrian airbases of Tadmur and T-4. No casualties were immediately reported in the aftermath of the attack. Israel says it is hitting military sites linked to Iranian forces and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, both allies of the former Syrian government. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Monday during a visit to Jerusalem that Israeli airstrikes on Syria and Lebanon risked “further escalation” in the region. “Military actions must be proportionate, and Israeli strikes into Syria and Lebanon risk further escalation,” Kallas was quoted as saying as a joint news conference with Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar. Israel’s air force carried out hundreds of airstrikes against weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime last year in what it said was an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. Kallas said Israel’s attacks were “unnecessary because Syria is right now not attacking Israel and that feeds more radicalisation that is also against Israel”.

Give ‘em Hell Harry!!!#HouthisAreTerrorists pic.twitter.com/BdYihp7PyK — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) March 25, 2025 The post came after reports of new US attacks on the northern province of Saada, which reportedly injured at least two people and destroyed a cancer hospital. The Houthis, an armed movement who have taken control of most of Yemen over the past decade, say they have targeted international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza. The attacks stopped when a fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January - a day before Donald Trump took office - but earlier this month the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. On 15 March, the Trump administration launched what it described as a “decisive and powerful” series of deadly airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, with the stated aim of deterring the rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping. Officials say the US strikes have killed many civilians, including women and children. Share Updated at 04.31 EDT\n\n7h ago 04.03 EDT As we mentioned in the opening summary, Israel’s security cabinet has approved a suggestion by the country’s defence minister, Israel Katz, to set up a new administration within his department tasked with enabling Palestinians to “voluntarily” leave Gaza, their homelands. In a statement a couple of days ago, Katz’s office said the new directorate would work to: Prepare for and enable safe and controlled passage of Gaza residents for their voluntary departure to third countries, including securing their movement, establishing movement routes, checking pedestrians at designated crossings in the Gaza Strip, as well as coordinating the provision of infrastructure that will enable passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries. Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are among the countries that have heavily condemned the Israeli plan. The Qatari foreign ministry said that “any form of Palestinian displacement constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law”. Jordan’s foreign ministry wrote in a post on X: The ministry of foreign affairs and expatriates condemned in the strongest terms Israel’s announcement of the establishment of a special agency targeting the displacement of Palestinians under the pretext of “voluntary departure” from the Gaza Strip. This coincided with the Israeli security cabinet’s approval of the demolition of 13 illegal settlement neighborhoods in the West Bank, in preparation for their “legalisation” as colonial settlements. The ministry stressed that all Israeli measures targeting the Palestinian presence on their land are invalid and represent a flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and part of practices that constitute the crime of forced displacement of Palestinians from their occupied land.

        "content": "Hillary Clinton – the former US secretary of state who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump amid a scandal over her use of a private server for classified emails – reacted to Monday’s news of a leak of highly sensitive military plans at the White House by saying: “You have got to be kidding me.”\n\nClinton punctuated her reaction on the X platform with an eyes emoji and a link to an Atlantic article that revealed how Trump officials inadvertently broadcast plans of US airstrikes on Houthi rebels through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.\n\nTrump and his supporters criticized her ruthlessly for her classified emails and private server use before and after he defeated her in the presidential election nine years earlier, even calling for her to be imprisoned.\n\nAmong them were some of the participants in the group chat reported on by the Atlantic: the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the Central Intelligence Agency director, John Ratcliffe; and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.\n\n“If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now,” ex-Fox News host Hegseth said on his former network in 2016, as CNN showed in a montage which went viral Monday night.\n\nThat same year, Rubio remarked on Fox: “Nobody is above the law – not even Hillary Clinton, even though she thinks she is.”\n\nIn 2019, Ratcliffe told Fox: “Mishandling classified information is still a violation of the Espionage Act.”\n\nAnd in a 2023 CNN appearance, Waltz complained about the lack of prosecution over “the Clinton emails”.\n\nAll were appointed to Trump’s cabinet after he won his second presidency in November.\n\nOn Monday, the White House confirmed the leak reported by the Atlantic but essentially insisted it had been harmless, demonstrating “deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials”.\n\n“The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,” White House spokesperson Brian Hughes told the Guardian.\n\nHegseth, meanwhile, insulted the Atlantic journalist who was inadvertently brought into his Signal chat, Jeffrey Goldberg, as “a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes”. Hegseth asserted: “Nobody was texting war plans,” prompting Goldberg to respond on MSNBC by saying he had seen a “minute-by-minute accounting” of plans to bomb targets in Yemen associated with Houthis.\n\nAsked Monday for his take on Goldberg’s report, Trump claimed: “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic … but I know nothing about it.”\n\nBy Tuesday, he reportedly told NBC News that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man”. He also echoed Hughes in claiming Goldberg’s presence in the Signal chat “had no impact at all” on the ensuing military operation.\n\nClinton served as secretary of state under former president Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013.\n\nAs she ran for the presidency, the FBI’s then-director James Comey said there was evidence Clinton had either sent or received 113 emails on a private server with information that was classified at the time of the correspondence. Information in another 2,000 emails or so was later classified.\n\nComey said Clinton had been “extremely careless” but had not acted in a way rising to the level of criminal charges.",

        "content": "If Europe wasn’t already on notice, the extraordinary leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen was another sign that it has a target on its back.\n\nThe administration officials gave Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic a front-row seat to the planning for the strike against the Houthis – a stunning intelligence leak that has caused anger against Republicans who called for criminal investigations against Hillary Clinton and others for playing fast and loose with sensitive information.\n\nOn the face of it, the strike against the Houthis had far more to do with the administration’s policies on protecting maritime trade and containing Iran than its concerns about Europe freeloading on US defense spending and military prowess.\n\nBut Vance appears determined to push that angle as a reason to postpone the strike.\n\n“I think we are making a mistake,” wrote Vance, adding that while only 3% of US trade goes through the Suez canal, 40% of European trade does. “There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary,” he added. “The strongest reason to do this is, as [Trump] said, to send a message.”\n\nVance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).\n\nIt was during this policy discussion, Goldberg wrote, that he was convinced that he was reading remarks by the real Vance, as well as defense secretary Pete Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, and senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nThen Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump’s saying that the strike would undermine the president’s Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.\n\n“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nThose designated on the call also reflect the vice-president’s growing clout in foreign policymaking circles. Vance named Andy Baker, his national security advisor who helped lead the transition team at the Pentagon, as his representative. Hegseth named Dan Caldwell, a leading proponent of “restraint” in the exercise of US foreign power abroad to protect Europe and counter rivals like Russia, indicating the Vance team’s presence at high levels of the Pentagon as well.\n\nAt heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance’s views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. But Vance appears far more confrontational and principled in his antipathy toward the transatlantic alliance, and has attacked European leaders for backing values that he says are not aligned with the US.\n\nThat makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies. Another European diplomat said: “He is very dangerous for Europe … maybe the most [dangerous] in the administration.” Another said he was “obsessed” with driving a wedge between Europe and the US.\n\nBack on the chat some sought – carefully – to talk Vance down. Hegseth said the strike would promote “core” American values including freedom of navigation and pre-establish deterrence. But he said the strikes could wait, if desired. Waltz, a foreign policy traditionalist, said: “It will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.” But he agreed that the administration sought to “compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans”.\n\n“If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance replied. Hegseth agreed that “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” But, he added, “we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nMiller, the Trump confidant, effectively ended the conversation by saying that the president had been clear. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.”\n\nBroadly, the administration’s policies on Europe are coming into focus. And there are few stepping up to voice backing for Nato or for Europe writ large. On a podcast interview this weekend, the senior Trump envoy Steve Witkoff mused about the potential for the Gulf economies to replace those of Europe. “It could be much bigger than Europe. Europe is dysfunctional today,” he said.\n\nTucker Carlson, the host and another Trump confidant, agreed. “It would be good for the world because Europe is dying,” he said.",

        "title": "‘The Democratic party has no grassroots’: Bernie Sanders on how to fight the Trump blitzkrieg",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Bernie Sanders said Donald Trump has “absolutely” created a constitutional crisis in the United States and is pushing the country “very rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society”.\n\nThe independent senator from Vermont has been rallying the anti-Trump resistance on a cross-country “Fight Oligarchy” tour, drawing some of the largest crowds of his decades-long political career as he taps into rising anger over the president’s stunning power grabs.\n\nIn an interview after an event in Tempe, Arizona, on Thursday night, Sanders accused Trump of “illegally” attempting to dissolve government agencies, including via an executive order, signed hours before the senator took the stage, to dismantle the US Department of Education, which cannot be done without the approval of Congress. He also pointed to the Trump administration’s defiance of a federal judge’s order not to deport a group of Venezuelan immigrants.\n\n“So yes, I think we are in the midst of the constitutional crisis,” Sanders said.\n\nIn the dizzying two months since Trump returned to power, Sanders is packing venues across the country – in Republican-held districts and swing states Democrats lost in 2024. The senator said Americans were clearly “very disturbed” by the daily turmoil in Washington, and that they felt squeezed, stressed and desperate for leaders who are willing to fight for them.\n\n“For years, I’ve talked about the concept of oligarchy as an abstraction,” Sanders said. But he believes the message hits harder now that Elon Musk, the world’s richest person who donated nearly $300m to elect Trump and other Republicans in 2024, is leading the administration’s government-slashing effort that includes overhauls of veterans’ services and social security. “You’ve gotta be kind of blind not to understand that you have a government of the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, by the billionaire class.”\n\nLocked out of power in Washington, the opposition party must learn to fight harder, Sanders said, echoing the calls of angry constituents across the country.\n\n“There’s got to be more militancy in the Congress in making Republicans pay a price in one way or another for what they’re doing,” Sanders said, calling the Democrats’ support for the GOP-written spending bill a “disaster”.\n\nDespite his criticism, Sanders has refused to engage with questions about the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is facing calls for his resignation after he paved the way for the bill without extracting any concessions. During an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Sanders dismissed as “nonsense” a question about whether the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should run for the Senate, which some have suggested is a way to primary Schumer. Schumer has remained defiant, and cited his early encouragement of Sanders’ cross-country tour as an example of his strong leadership instincts.\n\nIn the interview, Sanders, a progressive who caucuses with the Democrats and has twice sought the party’s nomination, argued that Democrats’ troubles run much deeper than one person or one decision.\n\n“The problem is the Democratic party has no grassroots,” he said in the interview on Thursday. Gesturing to the overflow crowd that turned out to his rally with Ocasio-Cortez in Arizona, he said of his colleagues: “You tell me how many people are going out?”\n\nSanders’ popularity comes at a moment when approval of the Democratic party is at record lows.\n\nIn his view, the party’s descent traces the rise of money in politics, which over time made Democrats reliant on wealthy donors and inside-the-Beltway consultants. While he credited the party with ushering in progress on social issues such as civil rights, women’s rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the senator said Democrats have for too long failed to champion an economic agenda that would meaningfully address the concerns of working-class people – an assessment many leaders roundly rejected.\n\nYet after decades of warning against the ills of corporate concentration and rising wealth inequality, Sanders, a big smile spreading across his face, said he was “noticing” that more of his colleagues were starting to adopt his populist pitch.\n\n“My colleagues are not dumb people. They are by and large very, very smart people. And you’ve got to be deaf, dumb and blind, not to analyze the solution,” he said, noting that Democrats not only lost support among working-class voters, but saw their support decline with young people and Latinos – key parts of the party’s electoral coalition. “They see those things, they read the polls. And I think some of them at least understand that there has to be a turn around, and they’ve got to start addressing the needs of working-class people.”\n\nAt 83, Sanders has all but ruled out a third presidential run. His joint appearances with Ocasio-Cortez last weekend generated speculation about her political future and whether she was prepared to assume the mantle of his progressive movement.\n\nIn the interview, Sanders reflected on how much the movement had grown since he was first elected to Congress in 1990 and co-founded the Progressive caucus: “There are dozens and dozens of really strong progressives out there who are, I think, going to be the future political leaders.”",

        "content": "It was shortly after Palestinian residents had finished their daily Ramadan fast that dozens of masked Israeli settlers entered the West Bank village of Susiya, according to witnesses.\n\nSome of the settlers were armed with batons, others had knives and one of them was holding an M16 rifle, the witnesses told the Guardian. Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village.\n\nMinutes later, the settlers walked straight over to the house of Hamdan Ballal, one of the four directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land that documented the destruction of villages in the West Bank – a film condemned in Israel and described by the country’s culture minister as “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.\n\nThe settlers started throwing stones against his house, witnesses said, and chased Ballal to his house, beating him and eventually handing him over to the military. Handcuffed and blindfolded by the soldiers, Ballal, bleeding from his head, was moved to a military vehicle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Ballal and two other Palestinians were released from a police station in Kiryat Arba, in the occupied West Bank, where they had spent the night on the floor while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.\n\n0:56 Moment Israeli settlers attack activists in West Bank – video\n\nThe Guardian has reviewed videos and photographs captured by activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV) who were on the scene, spoken to witnesses – including Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s directors – and contacted the Israel Defense Forces in order to shed light on an incident that sparked anger across the world.\n\nFive Jewish American activists from CJNV who tried to help Ballal as he was being beaten by the settlers said that, before the masked attackers entered the village, another group of settlers, mostly teenagers, had interrupted the celebrations for the break of the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, by shouting, pushing and swinging punches at Palestinians.\n\n“They were eventually followed by the masked settlers who started throwing stones,” a statement from CJNV said.\n\nVideo provided by CJNV showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.\n\n“They destroyed our car with stones and slashed one of the tires; all of the windows and windshields were broken,” one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the Guardian.\n\nMeanwhile, another group of settlers went to Ballal’s home, throwing stones at his car and house.\n\nBallal’s wife heard her husband being beaten outside and screaming: “I’m dying.”\n\nWitnesses said an Israeli police car arrived on the scene, but officers “refused to get out of the vehicle and intervene”. Instead, they began interrogating the Jewish American activists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ballal being detained by the Israeli military near his home. Photograph: Raviv Rose/AP\n\n“The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene,” said Adra. “While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.\n\n“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him,” he added. “Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”\n\nMembers of the activist group then entered Ballal’s house and saw blood on the floor, which a family member said was spilled when he was hit on the head.\n\nInjured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal was moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle.\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the IDF said there had been a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.\n\n“Last night [Monday], several terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving mutual rock-hurling between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene,” the statement said.\n\n“IDF and Israeli police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces.\n\n“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel police.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Ballal’s car after the attack. Photograph: Handout\n\nOn Tuesday, Ballal’s lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said he was released with the two other Palestinians detained during the incident, Nasser Shreiteh and Khaled Muhammad Shnaran.\n\nAssociated Press journalists saw the director leaving the police station where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.\n\nThis is not the first time that directors and crew members of No Other Land, and Palestinian residents of Susiya, have been attacked by settlers. CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.\n\n‘‘We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us,” said Adra. “This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment.”\n\nNo Other Land, which won the Oscar for best documentary feature film, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with the Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.\n\nView image in fullscreen A still from No Other Land. Photograph: Antipode Films\n\nThe film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, with Miami Beach proposing ending the lease of a cinema that screened the documentary. It has struggled to find a backer in the US and has instead been self-distributed.\n\nLast February, Adra was also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.\n\n“We risked our life to film,” he said, adding that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank in 1967, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centres.\n\nThe Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.\n\nDuring the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians, as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Hello, and welcome to TechScape. In this week’s edition: 23andMe files for bankruptcy, Nvidia forecasts a fusion of AI and robotics, and AI enables the creation of fiction at the pace of social media.\n\nGenetic testing firm 23andMe filed for bankruptcy on Monday. The CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki has stepped down after several attempts at a buyout. Once valued as high as $5.8bn in 2021, the company’s financial failure is the finale to a long decline.\n\n***\n\nMy colleague Julia Kollewe reports:\n\n23andMe said late on Sunday that it had started voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to “facilitate a sale process to maximise the value of its business”.\n\nThe loss-making company, which provides saliva-based test kits to customers to help them track their ancestry, added that it was operating as usual throughout the sale process. “There are no changes to the way the company stores, manages, or protects customer data,” it said.\n\nI understand the urge to assure customers that there is “no change” to business as usual at 23andMe, but the company’s statement bears an unfortunate implication. In late 2023, the company disclosed that hackers had gained access to the personal data of 7 million customers, including their genomes. Not long after the incursion, hackers offered to sell the names, addresses and genetic heritage belonging to 1 million 23andMe customers with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on a shadowy dark web forum. Though the hack did not only target Jewish customers, the proposed sale gave a grim example of what malicious denizens of net could do with 23andMe customers’ information.\n\nOne 23andMe participant, a man in Florida who discovered Ashkenazi Jewish heritage in his test, summed up the imbalance of the trade-off: “I didn’t know my family was going to potentially be a target. I may have put my family and myself in danger for something I did out of curiosity more than anything.”\n\nThe question for 23andMe customers is what will happen to the trove of genetic data that 23andMe has amassed in its years of collecting spit in tubes.\n\nThe ultimate promise of 23andMe – medicine personalized based on your unique genetic code – has not yet come to fruition. In the meantime, knowing the exact breakdown of your genetic ancestry is more novelty than medical necessity, and it’s not good business. Sometimes the test just reveals that you’re British, which left at least one Guardian writer nonplussed, and you find yourself having given your DNA away.\n\nThe question for 23andMe customers is what will happen to the trove of genetic data that 23andMe has amassed in its years of collecting spit in tubes. Over the weekend the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, urged the company’s users to ask it to “delete your data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company”, as is their right under the state’s law.\n\nMore on 23andMe\n\nThe stuff of science fiction\n\nView image in fullscreen Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, interacts with a small robot on stage during the keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, on 18 March. Photograph: Brittany Hosea-Small/Reuters\n\nA series of convergent developments in tech last week have my nose pointed at the future like a hunting dog.\n\nNvidia hosted its developer conference in San Jose, California, announcing new and more powerful chips that will offer greater computing capacity to artificial intelligence. The AI business, if Chinese model DeepSeek serves as a bellwether, is learning to maximize the results it draws from that computing power.\n\nAs in any good science fiction blockbuster, a lovable side character made an appearance at the conference. A Star Wars-inspired droid named Blue waddled onstage alongside Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, during his keynote to say hello. Disney partnered with Nvidia to design and showcase the new bot, which holds in its brain software for modeling and processing the physics of its surroundings. Nvidia also announced an AI meant for robots, which likewise takes its name from a Disney franchise, Groot N1.\n\nNvidia’s announcements come as various AI companies make their first public forays into agentic models, which can take on tasks for you. Per early reviews, these products are not very adept yet.\n\nBut excitement i for the advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is growing, and real preparations are happening. More and more people who aren’t AI company CEOs anticipate the arrival of this powerful and versatile technology soon. Joe Biden’s top AI adviser, Ben Buchanan, gave an interview at the start of this month about how the US had planned for the widespread arrival of AGI under the previous administration. Soon after, a Times tech columnist wrote about why he’s come to believe the AGI hype.\n\nAn agentic AI with the capabilities of AGI plugged into the brain of a robot – baby, that’s a bona fide humanoid, and it’s a possibility that’s becoming easier to imagine even without the help of Isaac Asimov.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re usually 90 seconds long. Dylan said he was inspired to create the videos by works of dark fantasy (Clark Ashton Smith), Elden Ring and other Dark Souls games, and analog horror videos on YouTube. Far from AI slop, the videos offer clever tidbits of the absurd and compelling stories in the form of occult instructions. The human touch is evident, though AI serves as the means of production. I enjoy them.\n\n“I do the writing myself because I was born with the faculties to do that. I use AI to make the images because I don’t have those faculties. It’s a means to an end,” he said.\n\nThe account has amassed more than half a million followers since launching in the first half of 2024. It earns money via TikTok ads and merch sales, according to Dylan, but he’s kept his full-time job in tech.\n\n“I went from a hobbyist to a niche internet micro celebrity!” he remarked. His fiancee has started an AI art page as well.\n\nDylan’s creative process involves multiple AI tools. He asks Dall-E to make the first draft of the picture in his head then runs the result through Midjourney to give it the retro video game sheen. If the story he’s writing requires animation, he uses Kling, though most of Holy Fool’s videos consist of collages of still images. All of his material features the same background music, a simple electronic synth melody, and the same narrating voice, which he generated and customized with ElevenLabs.\n\nArtists across the US and UK have spoken out by the hundreds against the use of AI in the arts and what they see as theft by tech giants skirting intellectual property law. Their point is a fair one. Just this past week, the Atlantic created a way for authors to search LibGen, a database of pirated books, for their work. Many found their books there. Meta employees allegedly downloaded the database from peer-to-peer file sharing networks, a matter currently at issue in a copyright suit against the company over how it created its AI model Llama, specifically concerning whether the chatbot was trained on copyrighted material. The messages between Meta staff revealed in discovery about downloading the database are damning. Employees said licensing authors’ copyrighted work would be too expensive and slow, so they turned to more shadowy means of accessing mammoth amounts of texts and received Mark Zuckerberg’s personal approval to do so, according to court documents. Meta is worth $1.51tn, and Mark Zuckerberg’s personal fortune weighs in at $202bn.\n\nHowever, none of these artists and authors are doing what the Holy Fool is. None are populating a fictional universe with daily short-form videos. Why would they? To create content at the speed that an Instagram feed without AI would be a full-time job. For many influencers, it is, but those video creators use their own faces and make videos about their real lives. Animating fictional videos so quickly and posting them for free is unlikely to give a worthwhile return on investment. All that is to say – there seems to be no labor lost in the creation of these kinds of videos, no artist who would otherwise be earning a living but has been replaced by AI. The creation of new kinds of serialized fiction seems like a positive use case for AI to me.\n\nThe wider TechScape",

They date back to the first century, around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain under Emperor Claudius, and are almost certainly associated with a tribe called the Brigantes who controlled most of northern England.\n\nThe objects include parts from wagons and/or chariots including 28 iron tyres, elaborate harnesses for at least 14 horses, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and two beautifully ornate cauldrons, one of which was probably used as a wine mixing bowl.\n\nExperts involved in the find, described as internationally important, say the objects may lead to a reassessment of how we understand subjects such as wealth, status, trade and travel among Britain’s iron age tribes.\n\nThe hoard was discovered and reported just before Christmas 2021 by a metal detectorist, Peter Heads, who got a reading, dug a hole and realised he needed expert help.\n\nView image in fullscreen Close-up of one of two mask-like human faces decorating the shoulder of a lidded vessel or cauldron.

Moore saw right away the potential significance of what had been uncovered but had no idea it would be of such a jaw-dropping scale.\n\n“Finding a hoard or collection of 10 objects is unusual, it’s exciting, but finding something of this scale is just unprecedented,” he said. “We were not expecting it … I think for everybody on the team, we were just lost for words.”\n\nAfter securing £120,000 funding from Historic England, excavations took place in 2022, including the removal of one large block of tangled metal objects that may have been in a bag together.\n\nMoore said the horse harnesses pulling the wagons or chariots were beautifully decorated with coral and coloured glass and, with the vehicles, would have been quite a sight. “They would have looked incredible,” he said. “It just emphasises that these people had real status and real wealth.\n\n“Some people have regarded the north as being impoverished compared to the iron age of the south of Britain. This shows that individuals there had the same quality of materials and wealth and status and networks as people in the south.\n\n“They challenge our way of thinking and show the north is definitely not a backwater in the iron age. It is just as interconnected, powerful and wealthy as iron age communities in the south.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Bent iron tyres and a cauldron at the excavation site. Photograph: Durham University/PA\n\nKeith Emerick, an inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the decision to provide funding was agreed the same day Moore contacted him. “The scale of the find and the material in it is completely unparalleled in this country,” he said. “To have something like this from the north of England is really exceptional.”\n\nHe recalled seeing the objects laid out at Durham. “It was one of those wow moments really, just to see how rich and splendid and mind-bogglingly beautiful some of it is. It has been a once-in-a-lifetime find for everyone involved.”\n\nMoore said the working assumption was that the high-status objects belonged to someone who was “probably part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world”.\n\nA lot of the material had been burned, suggesting it may have been part of a funerary pyre for an elite person before being thrown in a ditch.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dr Emily Williams and Prof Tom Moore of Durham University examine a block of tangled artefacts that have corroded together. Photograph: Durham University/PA\n\nMoore said one of the most exciting parts of the discovery was the first evidence of four-wheeled wagons used by iron age tribes in Britain, possibly imitating vehicles seen in continental Europe. He said: “We’re going to have spend years thinking what did these vehicles look like, where did they come from?”\n\nThe Melsonby hoard has been valued at £254,000 and a fundraising campaign to secure it for the nation will be launched by the Yorkshire Museum in York.\n\nIts discovery was announced jointly by Historic England, Durham University and the British Museum.\n\nThe heritage minister, Chris Bryant, said the hoard was an extraordinary find “which will help us to better understand the fabric of our nation’s history”.\n\nEmerick said the find posed lots of interesting questions. Julius Caesar led the first Roman expeditions to Britain a century before Claudius’s invasion and the Brigantes would have known about them. “You kind of look at this material and ask is this people thinking about the end of something, or are they thinking about the beginning of something?”",

        "content": "A long investigation into the mysterious death in 2023 of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested the boy’s grandparents on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe death of Émile Soleil, who was two and a half when he went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, has remained unexplained even after the discovery of his skull and teeth by a walker just over a mile from the village nine months after his disappearance.\n\nProsecutors at the time said the cause of his death, which shocked the country, could have been “a fall, manslaughter or murder”. Police later found more bones and items of the boy’s clothing.\n\nÉmile was at his grandparents’ summer home in the small hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Two neighbours last saw him walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000ft) up in the French Alps. His mother and father were absent on the day of his disappearance.\n\nSome media outlets had focused on the role of the boy’s grandfather, who was questioned in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school, but police had considered his involvement as only one of many possible hypotheses explaining the boy’s death.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning the grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of “voluntary homicide”, the chief prosecutor of Aix-en-Provence, Jean-Luc Blachon, said in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.\n\nContacted by AFP the couple’s lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, said she had no comment, having “only just heard” about the development.\n\nTwo other members of the family were also arrested, prosecutors said. Their identity was not revealed.\n\nSpeculation that a development in the case was imminent resurfaced earlier this month when investigators returned to the village. Tuesday’s arrests were the result of fact-finding “over recent months”, the prosecutor told reporters, adding that forensic police were examining “several spots in the area”.\n\nA funeral mass for the toddler was held in February this year in the presence of several hundreds of mourners. Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying “the period of silence must yield to the period of truth”, adding: “We need to understand, we need to know.”",

        "content": "Do you like being shackled and strip-searched? Absolutely no judgment if so, but anyone who isn’t into that sort of thing may want to avoid a holiday to the US at the moment. Although I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that. Unless you’ve been hiding under a news-blocking rock (in which case: what’s the address? And can I join you?), you’ll have noticed that Donald Trump’s America hasn’t exactly been rolling out the red carpet for visitors. There have been a number of recent incidents where white westerners – people who aren’t normally targeted by overzealous US immigration authorities – have been detained, deported or denied entry for obscure reasons.\n\nTake the 28-year-old Welsh artist Rebecca Burke, for example. She was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for 19 days in what her father described as “horrendous conditions”. Now, to be fair, Burke had the wrong paperwork: she hadn’t realised that she needed a working visa instead of a tourist visa in order to exchange domestic chores for accommodation with a host family. But getting imprisoned for almost three weeks over a mix-up and then being led on to a deportation flight – in chains! – back to a country that is supposedly a close ally, is obviously extreme. A Canadian woman also made headlines after being detained by Ice for two weeks when immigration enforcement officers flagged her visa application paperwork. And two German tourists were similarly held for almost two weeks in a detention centre.\n\nIn response, some countries have beefed up their advice about travel to the US. Last week, Germany updated its US travel advisory to emphasise that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry. Meanwhile, the UK’s Foreign Office has revised its guidance to emphasise that you should comply with all requirements as “the authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly [and] you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules”.\n\nForget being careful about following the rules – just don’t come here. Why spend your money in the US, which is threatening to annex its neighbours and rapidly descending into authoritarianism? I don’t say any of that lightly, to be clear. The US government is not synonymous with the American people. The majority of those didn’t actually vote for Trump: only about 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot for him. There will be plenty of people in the tourism industry who are horrified about what’s happening and who may be hurt from a drop-off in international travel.\n\nNevertheless, choosing how we spend our cash is the greatest power most of us have. And choosing to deploy it in Trump’s America helps normalise an abnormal situation. If I (a British-Palestinian with a US green card) wasn’t based in Philadelphia already, I absolutely wouldn’t be thinking about travelling stateside right now.\n\nI’ll tell you what I am thinking about a lot at the moment, however: whether it’s wise for me to do any sort of travel that involves interaction with US border authorities. When I got my green card 10 years ago, after spending more than $11,000 on legal fees and huge amounts of time on paperwork, I thought I’d finally be able to stop worrying about my US immigration status. Now, of course, as the high-profile detention of Mahmoud Khalil over his pro-Palestine activism shows, not even permanent residents are secure. Particularly if (like me) you have publicly expressed “controversial” ideas such as: Palestinians are human beings; Israel shouldn’t be allowed to kill children with impunity; and Americans should be outraged that their taxpayer dollars are being used to fund a genocide.\n\nBut not even keeping quiet about Palestine will protect you. Fabian Schmidt, a German green card holder, was recently detained and “violently interrogated” by US border officials – who reportedly forced him to strip and take a cold shower – for reasons that aren’t clear. Heck, you’re not even safe if you’re an American citizen. Trump recently threatened to send anti-Tesla protesters to a notorious prison in El Salvador. I used to joke about getting deported, but it’s not really something to laugh about any more – it’s something to have an emergency plan for.",

        "content": "A catastrophic security leak is triggering bipartisan outrage after the Atlantic revealed that senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.\n\nOn the Senate floor on Monday, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called it “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time” and urged Republicans to seek a “full investigation into how this happened, the damage it created and how we can avoid it in the future”.\n\n“Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime – even if accidentally,” the Delaware senator Chris Coons wrote on Twitter/X. “We can’t trust anyone in this dangerous administration to keep Americans safe.”\n\nThe New York representative Pat Ryan called the incident “Fubar” (an acronym for “fucked up beyond all recognition”) and threatened to launch his own congressional investigation “IMMEDIATELY” if House Republicans fail to act.\n\nAccording to reporting in the Atlantic, the editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally invited into a Signal chat group with more than a dozen senior Trump administration officials including Vice-President JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, national security adviser, Mike Waltz, secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and others.\n\n1:44 Hegseth accuses journalist of 'peddling hoaxes' after secret Yemen war plans shared on app – video\n\nThe reporting exposes not only a historic mishandling of national security information but a potentially illegal communication chain in which sensitive military plans about airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen were casually shared in an encrypted group chat with automatic delete functions.\n\n“It has made us look weak to our adversaries,” the California congressman Ro Khanna told the Guardian. “We need to take cybersecurity far more seriously and I look forward to leading on that.”\n\nAs the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Jim Himes has overseen countless classified briefings. But the Signal group chat leak of impending war plans has made him “horrified”.\n\n“If true, these actions are a brazen violation of laws and regulations that exist to protect national security, including the safety of Americans serving in harm’s way,’ he said. “These individuals know the calamitous risks of transmitting classified information across unclassified systems, and they also know that if a lower-ranking official under their command did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation.”\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, posted on social media: “This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation’s most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe.”\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic minority leader, called for a “substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach”, saying the leak was “completely outrageous and shocks the conscience”.\n\nThe Republican senator John Cornyn described the incident more colloquially, telling reporters it was “a huge screw-up” and suggesting that “the interagency would look at that” to determine how such a significant security lapse occurred.\n\nThe White House confirmed the leak. The national security council spokesperson, Brian Hughes, told the Guardian: “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”\n\nBut the White House attempted to defend the communications, with Hughes describing the messages as an example of “deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials”.\n\n“The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,” Hughes said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Rhode Island senator Jack Reed said on X that the incident represented “one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen”.\n\nThe echoes of past document controversies are also coming back to haunt some of the senior officials in the chat, who previously criticized similar security breaches. In 2023, Waltz – the current national security adviser – had said “Biden’s sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton’s private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing.”\n\nIn 2023, Hegseth had his own critique of the Biden administration handling classified documents “flippantly”, remarking on Fox News that “If at the very top there’s no accountability”, then we have “two tiers of justice”.\n\nWhen pressed by a reporter about the group chat on Monday, Hegseth said that “nobody was texting war plans” and attacked Goldberg as “deceitful and highly discredited” without refuting any specifics from the Atlantic story.\n\nIn response to the accidental leak, Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, called on Hegseth to resign or be fired from his position as defense secretary.\n\nIn a statement, Martin said: “It’s crystal clear that our men and women in uniform deserve better – and that our national security cannot be left in Hegseth’s incompetent and unqualified hands.”\n\nThe bombshell revelation also potentially violated federal record-keeping laws. The Federal Records Act, which mandates preservation of government communications, typically mandates that records are kept for two years, and the Signal messages were scheduled to automatically delete in under four weeks.\n\nThe New York Republican representative Mike Lawler summed up the bipartisan consensus: “Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels – and certainly not to those without security clearances. Period.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Warning: the below article contains spoilers for episode six, season three of The White Lotus.\n\nTalk about a hangover from hell. In the latest episode of The White Lotus, Saxon Ratliff woke up dazed and dishevelled from the previous night’s Full Moon party. It had been a long, messy day-and-night of booze, edibles, “lasers and shitty music”. Oh, and being pleasured by his own brother.\n\nThe blender-obsessed nepo baby, played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, regained consciousness on a superyacht, next to his naked younger brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola). Despite both Ratliffs insisting they’d blacked out, flashbacks kept floating to the surface.\n\nFirst the siblings snogged for a drunken dare during a Spin the Bottle-style game. Ex-model Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) breezily admitted she’d “hooked up with both brothers”. Toxic jock Saxon had a hazy memory of Chloe and Lochlan having intercourse while he masturbated next to them. Hang on. Was that definitely his hand beneath the bedsheet?\n\nEventually, a queasy image came into focus. The women matter-of-factly reminded Saxon that Lochlan “jerked you off”. Saxon was disbelieving at first, before blaming the drugs. “I don’t think there’s a drug in the world that’d make me get with my brother,” deadpanned Chelsea. At which point Saxon stumbled off to throw up again. The power balance between the brothers seems to have tipped. Is little Lockie now the alpha bro?\n\nHBO’s super-rich spa satire had been dangling this taboo-busting prospect for the previous five episodes. There was a distinct whiff of dysfunction between the Ratliff siblings since they touched down in Thailand. When first escorted to their villa, the family of five were informed there were only three bedrooms. “You can sleep with me,” sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) told Lochlan. “I don’t mind.” Saxon promptly made it even weirder: “Brothers and sisters don’t sleep together after they have full-grown, you know, genitals.”\n\nThe priapic protein shake enthusiast has a habit of making suspiciously over-sexualised remarks. “Dude, long plane rides make me so fucking horny,” he said poolside, ostentatiously adjusting his trunks. Piper, a gap year Buddhist, was understandably upset by her brothers grilling her about whether she’s still a virgin. In their adjacent beds that night, Saxon called his sister “pretty hot”, insisting that Lochlan must have noticed too.\n\nHe proceeded to browse porn on his iPad, before heading butt-naked to the bathroom. Lochlan ogled him before Saxon caught his eye and closed the door. Social media blew up with speculation about an incoming incest plotline. And now writer Mike White has finally gone there. Schwarzenegger has acknowledged the “very odd and weird” dynamic between the brothers, adding that certain scenes were “uncomfortable to watch with my family”.\n\nWhite has deployed sexual shock tactics in all three seasons so far, with eye-popping male nudity and graphic gay romps. In the Sicily-set second series, Leo Woodall’s Jack was caught mid-coitus with his “uncle” Quentin (Tom Hollander). This familial cliffhanger was resolved with the revelation that they weren’t actually related. This time, though, The White Lotus did it for real.\n\nView image in fullscreen Clive Owen and Saskia Reeves in Close My Eyes. Photograph: Beambright/Four Four Int/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSibling incest has long been a TV taboo. Nearly 50 years ago, the BBC’s Roman epic I, Claudius – sort of Succession in togas – showed John Hurt’s Emperor Caligula fathering a child with his sister Drusilla. Playwright Stephen Poliakoff’s 1991 film Close My Eyes portrayed the obsessive love between Clive Owen’s town planner and his elder sister, played by Saskia Reeves. A few years later, scouse soap Brookside caused a stir by depicting a sexual relationship between siblings Nat and Georgia Simpson. “We’re adults and we love one another,” Nat told their parents after they were found in bed together. There was tabloid uproar. MPs waded in. Producer Phil Redmond admitted it had gone too far and the Simpson family were written out.\n\nBut HBO dramas have continued the troubling trend. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are a veritable hotbed of icky inbreeding. Game of Thrones began with 10-year-old Bran Stark sneaking a peek at Queen Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime Lannister. “We shared a womb, we came into this world together, we belong together,” said the defiant Cersei when confronted. In prequel House of the Dragon, most of the Targaryens end up inter-marrying to keep their bloodline pure and their peroxide mullets intact.\n\nDuring the first and best series of True Detective, viewers glimpsed multiple murderer Errol Childress, AKA The Yellow King, in flagrante with his half-sister. Last year’s Prime Video reboot of Cruel Intentions ramped up the incestuous vibe between step-siblings Lucien and Caroline. And the 2021 Gossip Girl remake saw twins Grace and Jake hook up in a New York hotel room. “Even I didn’t see ‘twincest’ coming,” quipped their trans frenemy Luna.\n\nScreenwriter Andrew Davies insisted that the incestuous affair between siblings Hélène and Anatole Kuragina (Tuppence Middleton and Callum Turner) was “crucial” to his 2016 BBC adaptation of Tolstoy’s War & Peace. And in Tom Hardy’s aptly titled 2017 BBC show Taboo, the mud-spattered protagonist’s feelings for his half-sister Zilpha (Oona Chaplin) progressed from love letters to groping in church pews and ultimately the bedchamber. Chaplin told Vanity Fair: “There’s a sexual libertarianism right now. Girls are walking around with their asses hanging out. Guys are just as much. Sex has become a very public-display type of thing, so very few things have remained taboo. Where does the taboo lie now? I think it’s in incest.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to What's On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: PR\n\nLast year, there was a backlash against an incestuous scene between the Menendez brothers in Netflix’s true-crime dramatisation Monsters: The Lyle & Erik Menendez Story. Critics claimed the “sick” showrunner Ryan Murphy had “made up” the storyline. Murphy pushed back, arguing that it was important to “present points of view from many people involved in the case”. He pointed out that journalist Dominick Dunne, played by Nathan Lane, “wrote several articles about that theory”.\n\nWith their roots in classical literature and the Bible, incest stories are certainly nothing new. In the prestige TV era, however, they’re definitely becoming more frequent. For audiences hardened online, it’s a way of upping the ante in terms of sexual transgression, a shortcut to shocking a seemingly unshockable generation. Drugs and violence are so last century.\n\nWhen it comes to TV incest, it’s usually villainous characters who are the culprits. Saxon certainly falls into that category in The White Lotus. By invoking the ultimate taboo, White isn’t just breaking boundaries and baiting controversy, then. He is pointing out the deep-rooted corruption of the moneyed elite.\n\nThe show’s executive producer, David Bernad, told the New York Post last week that the scenes weren’t just for shock value and will pay off in the climactic two episodes: “There’s a specific reason in terms of the narrative storytelling and the larger thematic idea. As the season wraps up, you’ll see their purpose. The brother story culminates in a very satisfying way.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Thirteen years after his death from an overdose of alcohol and valium, the American painter Thomas Kinkade’s brand lives on. The original Thomas Kinkade store in Carmel, California, still operates, and the official Kinkade Instagram account has a tidy, if modest, 67,000 followers. A recent partnership with Disney features, among other things, a 16-month calendar showing some of the Disney empire’s best-known faces in fantastical landscapes.\n\nStill, this is but a shadow of the massive, multimedia Kinkade operation that reportedly netted over $2bn in total retail sales in 2004, licensing its images to everything from plates to calendars to greeting cards to actual Thomas Kinkade cottages that fans could live in. If you happened to be a sentient human being during the 1990s and 2000s, chances are you have at least some cultural memory of this artist who was as ubiquitous as could be. (Kinkade was fond of bragging that he reached the heights of everywhereness that Andy Warhol could only dream of.)\n\nThe veteran film editor Miranda Yousef’s first feature, Art for Everybody, attempts to document Kinkade’s startling rise to fame and ultimate fall, examining the artist from as many angles as possible. “One of my guiding lights is that you have to love your subject,” she told me in a video interview. “You can see in the film if a film-maker is contemptuous of the subject, and that gets in the way of telling a good and true story.”\n\nYousef was drawn to Kinkade’s story for being what she termed “a modern-day Greek tragedy” as well as for how it engaged numerous questions vital to the tastemaking cultural battlefields – among them, what is art and who gets to decide, the politicization of taste, and the cost of turning yourself into a brand. She felt determined to fully flesh out this person who she knew from her teenage years and who had largely become flattened by the media coverage of his life. “I grew up in Massachusetts, and Kinkade was in the malls, he was in the ether, he was just everywhere,” Yousef told me. “I knew there was more to this story because this person had this whole collection of unseen works that was completely different than what we knew of him. I knew there was a 3D person in there somewhere.”\n\nArguably Kinkade’s most prescient stroke was how he turned himself into a brand, obtaining a kind of quasi-influencer status years before there were social media networks capable of delivering fame and fortune. He reached his ubiquity the old fashioned way, through brick-and-mortar stores, a PBS TV show à la Bob Ross, endless merchandising opportunities, and an unbelievable hustle ethic. He even trademarked the “Painter of Light” moniker for himself. (Yousef does point out that the British Romantic artist JMW Turner beat him to that nickname by a good 150 years.)\n\nBut there was a dark side to his success – he was an alcoholic, was accused of multiple instances of sexual harassment, and even lost a $3m court case to Thomas Kinkade gallery operators for defrauding them. In giving so much of himself up to his personal brand, Kinkade did not exorcise his personal demons but rather made them stronger. “The film is about how denying yourself full self-expression will destroy you,” Yousef said. “Kinkade is almost a textbook definition of that. He built this empire around this personal brand, but it was almost a gilded cage, and he couldn’t keep up.”\n\nAnd, as Yousef points out in Art for Everybody, the art that Kinkade made was decidedly white and heteronormative, bending toward a Christian nationalist nostalgia that may have fed the yearning for an earlier, simpler time that has been exploited by the Maga movement. Yousef explained to me that she tried hard to find people of color to present in Art for Everybody, but was largely unable to do so. “His consumer base was not exclusively white, but it was overwhelmingly white,” she told me.\n\nTrue to these scandals and the ultimate bankruptcy of his empire, Kinkade has taken a beating in the press, and Yousef views her film as an act of “rehumanizing” the artist. She goes into his backstory, which involves an alternatively abusive and absent father, as well as a childhood home devoid of anything resembling art, so he made his own. In her telling, Kinkade wanted everyone to feel the solace that art brought to him. “He had this need and desire to have art on the walls of his home,” Yousef said. “It’s a universal feeling, he really felt like art should be for everybody, and that was part of his excitement surrounding this whole business idea.”\n\nYousef also gives plenty of screen time to Kinkade’s fans, who were legion. “We had a van that was filled top to bottom with fan letters,” she told me. “There were all these people reaching out to say ‘your art helped me.’” Art for Everybody features some of these letters directly, including one heartfelt missive that credited Kinkade’s paintings for helping to get over the loss of a sister, and another written by a sibling of a student murdered in the Columbine high school mass shooting who found solace in Kinkade’s work.\n\nThese testaments to the millions who felt a special connection to their Thomas Kinkade art are juxtaposed with a number of art critics, including the New Yorker’s Susan Orlean and the Pulitzer prize winner Christopher Knight, who are given plenty of space to knock Kinkade’s contribution to the art world. (Orlean once wrote that she bet the artist $1m that he’d never have a show in a major art museum in his lifetime.) Yousef also gains access to a family vault of art from Kinkade’s pre–Painter of Light era, filled with things that gain the approval of Orlean and Knight in a satisfying third act reveal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Tremolo\n\nIn that way, Art for Everybody makes the implicit argument that you can either make art that will win over the establishment or that will win over the greater population, but you can’t make both – in one telling scene, the successful Kinkade walks through an art school class, dismissing one student after another for making interesting work with no sales potential. Yousef also counterpoints Kinkade’s easy-to-love work with a few controversial pieces of capital-A art, such as Andres Serrano’s infamous photograph Piss Christ, which are compelling and even beautiful in their way, but that completely outrage Kinkade’s Christian fanbase. She believes that moving beyond these kinds of divisive arguments is crucial to the future of American society.\n\n“If there’s one thing I want for people to take away from the film, it’s the importance of viewing others with nuance and compassion,” she said. “I feel like political forces and the social media landscape and all of these things are conspiring to encourage us to dehumanize each other. It’s really important to rehumanize each other, because that’s the only way we’re going to move forward as a society.”\n\nOne can’t help but walk away from Art for Everybody feeling that Kinkade built up a billion-dollar empire in a fruitless attempt to satisfy the father that could never approve of him, and that he would have been better off processing all of that trauma through the sort of interesting but largely unsellable artworks that he produced earlier in his life. Instead, he ended up making paintings that hit the same note over and over in a way that is undeniably pleasing and eye-catching, but that feels like taking a hit of chocolate when what you really need is a therapy session.\n\nArt for Everybody does an admirable job of giving Kinkade an enormously fair treatment and interrogating the many questions implicated by his American tragedy. As much as anything, the movie is a cautionary tale to anyone thirsting for fame: be careful what you wish for, it just might end up controlling you. “It was too much, he couldn’t give it up,” Youself told me. “Imagine being like, my business is bringing in $100m per year and everywhere I go are these cheering crowds. That’s not easy for anybody to give up.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Less than seven weeks into Donald Trump’s second term as president, his administration has set off a new wave of handwringing over what has by now become a familiar question: has the US entered a constitutional crisis?\n\nTriggering the latest iteration of that worry, the government hastily deported more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without hearings or evidence and thus without anything even resembling due process of law, pursuant to the US president’s proclamation “signed in the dark on Friday evening” that they constituted an invasion by a foreign state.\n\nTrump invoked a 1798 statute last used to intern Japanese Americans during the second world war, buttressed by powers he claimed were inherent in the presidency. Chief judge James E Boasberg of the US district court for the District of Columbia rushed to convene a hearing on the legality of the challenged action as two deportation flights departed from Texas, followed quickly by a third. Moments after the judge ordered them to return so he could rule on a motion barring the deportation, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted: “Oopsie ... Too late”, with a laughing emoji, even as the court considered whether its order had been defied.\n\nThe branch of government best able to uncover and safeguard both our noblest traditions and the simple truth in moments such as these – the judiciary – has been hobbled and vilified by Trump and his allies, making wildly irresponsible calls for impeachment that put dangerous targets on the backs of judges who rule in ways they dislike. Even mild-mannered chief justice John Roberts had to cry “foul”. The administration’s cavalier attitude toward courts that fail to do its bidding, exemplified by calls for Boasberg’s removal, seemed to confirm concerns about a looming crisis.\n\nBut searching for evidence of a “constitutional crisis” in the rapidly escalating clashes of the executive branch with the judicial branch misses the larger cataclysm taking place across the US. This president, abetted by the supine acquiescence of the Republican Congress and licensed by a US supreme court partly of his own making, is not just temporarily deconstructing the institutions that comprise our democracy. He and his circle are making a bid to reshape the US altogether by systematically erasing and distorting the historical underpinnings of our 235-year-old experiment in self-government under law.\n\nWhat we are currently living through is nothing less than a reorganized forgetting of the building blocks of our republic and the history of our struggles, distorting what it means to be American. The body politic is being hollowed out by a rapidly metastasizing virus attacking the underpinnings of our entire constitutional system. Make no mistake. This is how dictatorship grows.\n\nSymptomatic of that reshaping is the peculiar emergence, in a duet staged by the president together with the world’s richest man and Trump’s main benefactor, of a co-presidency without precedent in our republic and without even a hint of the irony in such shared power being propagated by ideologues whose mantra has long been the need for a “unitary presidency”.\n\nAs staffers of the newly minted so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) raided congressionally created independent federal agencies and foundations without warning and slashed entire programs without thought, the Trump administration stuttered when asked by the courts to explain who was in charge of the “department” that no Congress had created – and how the leader of that enterprise had somehow acquired the power of the purse that the constitution clearly delegated only to Congress.\n\nMore than just stonewalling courts and refusing to provide basic information on government activities, the Trump administration has waged war on history itself. Having first debilitated our capacity to act, it is now coming after our capacity to think. The same day Boasberg directed the administration to explain why it had seemingly failed to comply with his order, Doge staffers marched into the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency responsible for funding many needy public museums, libraries and historic repositories across the country.\n\nLike Julius Caesar besieging and burning the Library of Alexandria, the Doge officials descended upon the IMLS to begin the process of gutting the public institutions dedicated to preserving and making widely available the shared memory of our past. It was none other than Benjamin Franklin whose conception of public libraries democratized knowledge and made it accessible to ordinary people. What used to be the private province of the few became the public province of the many.\n\nThe attack on the IMLS is only the latest episode of the Trump presidency’s attempt to privatize information while replacing authentic history with a version more to its liking. As internet archivists race to back up the nation’s files and records, Trump administration officials have been systematically purging government websites in real time of the tools, concepts and language we need to act as informed citizens. In response to secretary of defense Pete Hegseth’s order to remove “diversity” content from the department’s platforms, the Pentagon took down pages about the Holocaust, September 11, cancer awareness and suicide prevention. So too, the Department of Agriculture deleted entire datasets and resources that farmers relied on to identify ways of coping with heat waves, droughts, floods and wildfires. Websites belonging to the Small Business Administration and Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed their platforms of photographs and references to women, LGBTQ+ individuals and people of color, including facts about American heroes such as Jackie Robinson or Gen Colin Powell.\n\nTaken together, these events of the past few weeks reveal an alarmingly rapid collapse of what gives the United States constitution life and meaning. Its words may remain unchanged, but its role in our lives is crumbling before our eyes. Looking for a decisive explosion or a moment of crisis – what physicists call a singularity – in the chaotic onrush of presidential provocations is a fool’s errand, one calculated to disarm the resistance without which we will surely be doomed.\n\nThe seeds of our ongoing disintegration long precede Trump’s rise to power. They were planted decades ago by strategic politicians who dressed rightwing ideologies in conservative garments, permitting the darkest angels of our nature to take hold and to reach a climax in fake claims of a stolen election that led to an insurrection in our country’s capital, followed first by the Senate’s abdication of its duty in Trump’s second impeachment trial (on the bogus ground that the trial had begun too late to give the Senate jurisdiction) and next by the US supreme court’s gifting of Trump – and every future president – with a nearly absolute immunity transforming the office from one restrained by law to a source of virtually limitless power.\n\nRarely noted is how this frightening power to ignore federal criminal law has been conferred not only on the president but on his legions of loyal lieutenants, from public officials to private militias. Because the constitution itself gives presidents an unbridled power to pardon others – a power Trump reveled in employing to free from prison the violent insurrectionists that he had himself helped unleash – we now live under a system in which any president can license his trusted followers to commit crimes to consolidate his power and wealth, making clear that a pardon awaits them should they face federal prosecution. The upshot is that privateers in league with the president can safely ignore federal laws criminalizing corrupt evasion of rules designed to protect public health and safety while they casually usurp powers the constitution gave to Congress, moving so fast and breaking so much that not even genuinely independent federal courts can keep pace with the mayhem.\n\nIn his iconic poem The Hollow Men, TS Eliot a century ago famously wrote: “This is the way the world ends / This is the way the world ends / ... /Not with a bang but a whimper.” Rooted in our past, the anti-democracy virus has reached a fever pitch as it ravages the body politic and revises all traces of our history. It’s a virus we must fight with all the energy we can muster if we don’t want our system of self-government under law to die – not in a sudden explosion but with a quiet whimper.\n\nThe tragedy is that too many politicians and organizations are caving in without a fight, leading others to follow suit. With each surrender, Trump and his minions not only grow more emboldened but cement their hold on power by cracking down on all who dare oppose them in court, including lawyers who come to the aid of the administration’s enemies.\n\nWithout more courageous leaders – including Republican officeholders who fear being primaried by candidates backed by limitless wealth – and without more bravery on the part of corporate CEOs whose fortunes can be threatened by Trump, elite lawyers whose business can shrivel if Trump targets them, and ordinary citizens understandably fearing online threats and worse, this darkness will be our destiny as we are reduced to mere memories and then relegated to the vast wasteland of the forgotten.",

The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account for the deaths of Hossam Shabat and Mohammed Mansour. Journalists are civilians and it is illegal to attack them in a war zone.”\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted and killed Shabat and Mansour and labelled them as terrorists. The IDF said it had “eliminated the terrorist Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, a sniper terrorist from the Beit Hanoun Battalion of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who cynically posed as an Al Jazeera journalist.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Mohammed Mansour, a correspondent for Palestine Today, who was killed on Monday in an airstrike on his home.

I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents – anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival,” he wrote. “I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people’s side … I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest – something I haven’t known in the past 18 months … for the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.”",

        "content": "A Columbia University student who took part in pro-Palestinian protests at the university is suing Donald Trump’s administration for attempting to deport her.\n\nAttorneys for Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old who has legally resided in the US since childhood, filed a complaint on Monday describing the government’s actions as “shocking overreach” and an “unprecedented and unjustifiable assault” on her rights.\n\nChung has participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus since 2023, and was arrested earlier this month while protesting against the university’s “excessive punishments” of student activists, according to the lawsuit, which was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nDays later, the suit states, immigration authorities began efforts to arrest Chung and remove her from the country, and an official told her lawyer her status as a permanent resident was being “revoked”.\n\nThe development comes as the Trump administration has cracked down on immigrants who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests by seeking to strip them of their legal status and deport them.\n\nEarlier this month, immigration officials arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead protests at Columbia, and said they were acting on an order from the state department to revoke his green card. He remains in custody in Louisiana. His arrest sent fear through the university’s community of international students who worry they could have their visas revoked.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on behalf of Chung names Trump, Marco Rubio – who the lawsuit states ordered the revocation of Chung’s legal status – Kristi Noem and other officials. Trump and Rubio have both voiced support for revoking the visas of international students who take part in pro-Palestinian protests. Earlier this month, during a press conference about Khalil, Rubio said the government would “kick out” green card holders who participate in such demonstrations.\n\nMeanwhile some US embassies in Europe have posted warnings to potential tourists. A US embassy in Estonia wrote: “When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest. Now, if you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. You lied to us. You’re out.”\n\nBut the Trump administration is also targeting longtime residents of the US. Chung, a junior at Columbia, has resided in the US since age seven when her family immigrated to the US. She became a permanent resident in 2021, according to the complaint.\n\nJust three days after New York police arrested Chung while she was participating in demonstrations at Columbia, an Ice official reportedly signed an administrative arrest warrant for the student, according to the suit. The following day Ice agents went to Chung’s parents home looking for her and days later executed search warrants at two Columbia properties, including Chung’s dorm.\n\nChung’s suit accuses the Trump administration of a “larger pattern of attempted US government repression of constitutionally protected protest activity and other forms of speech” and states the government is seeking to “retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Ms Chung for their participation in protests”.\n\n“Ms Chung is challenging [the government’s] pattern and practice of targeting individuals associated with protests for Palestinian rights for immigration enforcement in retaliation for their core protected political speech,” the suit states.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In 1965, Micky Dolenz was an architecture student and jobbing actor in Los Angeles, doing the rounds of auditions for TV pilots. As a 10-year-old he had played the lead in a TV series called Circus Boy, but the former child star began to notice something odd about the jobs his agent was now sending him to: every one was for a series “about kids in a band”. He says: “One was called The Happeners, about a little folk trio like Peter, Paul and Mary. One was about a surfing band like the Beach Boys. Another was about a big family folk ensemble. Something was in the air, obviously, because of the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Four Seasons, Motown. Young people, who had disposable income, were being targeted.”\n\nNone of those shows got made but a fourth audition proved more fruitful: it called for “folk’n’roll musician/singers … four insane boys” who looked as if they might hang around a hip Sunset Strip coffee shop called Ben Frank’s. Dolenz got a leading role, happily acquiescing to learn to play drums. “It was kind of the same as when I was in Circus Boy and they told me I had to learn to ride an elephant – ‘Great! When do I start?’”\n\nThe series was green-lit and the Monkees proved so successful at parting young people from their disposable income that, within a year, Dolenz was unable to visit the shopping mall near his parents’ home in San Jose without causing pandemonium. “I go through the big glass doors and all of a sudden there are people running, screaming. I thought it was a fire. I hold open the big door and I’m going, ‘Slow down! Don’t run! Don’t panic! It’s all right!’ And suddenly I realised they were running at me. I was like, ‘Oh God!’”\n\nView image in fullscreen Child star … 10-year-old Dolenz in Circus Boy. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nIt was, he concedes, a very strange kind of fame. He was playing a character clearly based on himself and also called Micky – the drummer in a luckless fictional band called the Monkees. “We lived in a Malibu beach house,” he wryly notes, “and every episode had us trying to get a record deal or trying to get a gig and never making it – which does beg the question of how we could afford a Malibu beach house.”\n\nBut in real life, the band became one of the biggest in the world, at one juncture selling 6m albums and 5m singles in four months. Or rather, they were actors pretending to be a band, in order to front a succession of records that they hadn’t actually played on. Initially at least, everything but the vocals was handled by crack session musicians. When their second album, 1967’s More of the Monkees, was released, the first they knew about it was when it appeared in the shops.\n\nIt seems a deeply peculiar blurring of fantasy and reality, guaranteed to mess with an early twentysomething’s head. “Oh boy, oh boy!” chuckles Dolenz, tapping the side of his skull. “You don’t want to be in here sometimes! I think because of my upbringing in the business, I always attempted to separate the person from the persona. I wasn’t always successful, but that’s incredibly important if you want to survive. To some degree, I’ve always known that Micky the wacky drummer on television was who the girls were in love with – not me, Micky Dolenz, who grew up in the Valley. Now that’s easy to say, but sometimes very, very difficult to do. But if you don’t keep that separation, it can be disastrous. We see that happen all the time. An interesting, weird place to be.”\n\nIt’s even weirder that Dolenz is still talking about the Monkees nearly 60 years later. They weren’t supposed to have such staying power. The TV show was cancelled in 1968 after two seasons. The big hits dried up around the same time. But here Dolenz is, Zooming from his holiday home on the Delaware River a few days after his 80th birthday, the last surviving Monkee, looking jaunty in orange-tinted sunglasses and a rakishly angled trilby. (Davy Jones, Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith have all died.) Rewind TV is now repeating the show in the UK for the first time in years, although in truth, some channel somewhere in the world seems to have been re-running the series almost constantly since it was cancelled. It was a mainstay of children’s TV in the 70s, while MTV’s repeats in 1986 proved so popular, they triggered the first in a series of Monkees reunions.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘The wacky drummer’ … with the Monkees. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nThere is one sense in which the show’s longevity is surprising. You might have expected the music to last: from I’m a Believer to Daydream Believer, the big hits were exquisitely turned examples of the songwriter-for-hire’s craft. But the show is a kind of period piece, a last transmission from a more innocent era of 60s pop that was about to be overwhelmed by psychedelia and more serious-minded artistic ambition.\n\nDolenz, however, stopped being surprised at the show’s durability decades ago. “It was about a fictitious band that wanted to be the Beatles, or the Stones, or whoever. That struggle for success is a classic theme in Hollywood movies and Broadway shows. It was more like a little Marx Brothers musical on television than a band – a little romp, laughing, singing, music, shtick. John Lennon first made that comment, ‘The Monkees are like the Marx Brothers.’ He was absolutely right. And the comedy wasn’t topical, nor was it satirical. So it stands up, it has legs.”\n\nHe chafes a little at the suggestion that the Monkees were effectively a manufactured boyband, saying: “It was not a boyband. It was the cast of a television show, like when the cast of Glee made albums.” But Dolenz admits he was the member most comfortable with whatever the Monkees were: a showbiz pro, unbothered when albums appeared without their knowledge, or when the producers showed so little confidence in their ability to play live that they booked their first gig in Hawaii, “because back then Honolulu was like another planet, so they figured if we really sucked no one would hear what happened”.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You don’t want to be in my head’ … Dolenz today. Photograph: Kat Tuohy Photography\n\nThis was not a view shared by all his bandmates. When More of the Monkees appeared, a disgruntled Nesmith broke ranks, publicly describing it as “probably the worst album in the history of the world” and bluntly telling a reporter: “I don’t care if we never sell another record … tell the world we don’t record our own music.”\n\n“Frankly,” says Dolenz, “I didn’t give a shit one way or the other. I don’t mean I didn’t give a shit about Mike. I did – and I knew what he was going through. He was frustrated because he was misled. He was not an actor, he was a singer-songwriter, and they told him he was going to write and record his own music. And basically, he was not allowed to do that. In the very early days of the show, he went to the producers with his guitar and played them a song he’d written that he wanted the Monkees to record. According to him, they said, ‘Thank you, but no thank you – it’s not a Monkees song.’ He said, ‘Wait a minute, I am one of the fucking Monkees. What are you talking about?’ But they blew him off.\n\n“So Mike, in his inimitable manner, gave it to an unknown girl singer kicking around town, Linda Ronstadt. The song was called Different Drum. It was a Top 20 hit. So he was terribly frustrated and I felt for him, and I backed him. He’s the one that told me not to go to New York to record the new Monkees single – and I didn’t. I went to England, where I met Paul McCartney for the first time. He invited me to a Beatles session for Sgt Pepper. So – no regrets.”\n\nFor all that he viewed himself as an actor first, Dolenz seems to have rather enjoyed the life of a rock star. Some of the 60s pop aristocracy were a little snippy about the Monkees (the Byrds wrote the sarcastic So You Want to Be a Rock’n’Roll Star? about them) but most were not. Neil Young played on their albums. At one bizarre juncture, Frank Zappa asked Dolenz to become his drummer, but the Monkees’ record label wouldn’t give him permission. “I was sort of relieved,” says Dolenz. “I mean, you listen to his stuff and it’s like 7/13 time, you know, these ridiculous time signatures.”\n\nDolenz took full advantage, knocking around with the Beatles, hanging out backstage at the Monterey festival and inviting its star turn, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, to support the Monkees on tour – on the grounds that “he was very theatrical and the Monkees was a theatrical act”. This had disastrous consequences: Hendrix swiftly quit, dispirited by the experience of performing Purple Haze to nonplussed teens screaming for Davy Jones.\n\nWhen Nesmith’s gambit paid off and the Monkees were allowed to write and perform their own material, Dolenz jumped in with both feet. He wrote their fabulous 1967 hit Randy Scouse Git, was the first pop artist to take delivery of a Moog synthesiser, and says his happiest memories of the band were recording their third album, Headquarters. They were finally permitted to have a say: “Pinocchio became a real boy.”\n\n‘Now it’s this incredible cult film’ … watch the trailer for the Monkees’ film Head.\n\nDolenz has “absolutely no pains, no regrets, no pangs” that the series was cancelled. You could tell he was tiring of it from the final episode, which he wrote and directed. The plot involved TV controlling people’s minds via a symbol that looked remarkably like the logo of the CBS network. The episode was laced with references to marijuana, anti-war songs, and featured a guest appearance from Tim Buckley, debuting his exquisite Song to the Siren. None of it seemed designed to part young people from their disposable income.\n\nNor did Head, the 1968 Monkees film with a screenplay by Jack Nicholson, allegedly written under the influence of LSD. “We were looking to move on: we didn’t want to make a film that was a feature-length Monkees episode where Davy falls in love and the girl’s uncle is a crook and we have to save him and we sing her some songs. So Head was a little bit stream-of-consciousness. When they first screened the movie, it was not a typical screening. They had ‘movieolas’, with one of the five reels of the film in each and the idea was you could start watching the movie from any point on any reel.” He laughs. “It was a very, very 60s idea.”\n\nDolenz sees Head as a film about breaking the traditional rules of Hollywood, which its producers and Nicholson would go on to do with Easy Rider the following year. “There’s a lot of breaking the fourth wall, a scene where I start talking to the director and say, ‘I can’t take this any more’ and walk off through the back of the set, through the typical Hollywood backdrop painting.”\n\nBut it was also very obviously about the Monkees and their discomfort with being, as one song from the soundtrack puts it, “a manufactured image with no philosophies”. It ends with the band trapped in a glass tank, being stored away in a studio warehouse. “It did terribly at the box office,” says Dolenz. “Nobody seemed to care. I certainly didn’t. But of course now it’s this incredible cult film. Every once in a while, someone comes up to me and tells me it’s great. Quentin Tarantino did, so did Edgar Wright, a wonderful director. It’s a very interesting little film.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘No Monkee business’ … Dolenz in his producer/director role with Metal Mickey. Photograph: Phillip Jackson/ANL/Shutterstock\n\nIt more or less ended the Monkees’ commercial career. Tork left, then Nesmith. Dolenz and Jones soldiered on, then split in 1970. Dolenz says he never really had any further ambitions in music. He eventually moved to England and reinvented himself as a producer and director, famously directing the 80s kids’ show Metal Mickey. “No Monkee business,” he nods. “I remember that feeling, that moment when someone interviewed me and the article didn’t say, ‘Micky Dolenz, ex-Monkee.’ It said, ‘Michael Dolenz, producer/director.’ Not that I ever tried to escape the Monkees, but I carved out this different career, so when the Monkees first reunited in 1986 I was fine. I had no problem going back and recreating that character.”\n\nHe toured, on and off, with various iterations of the Monkees until all the other members died. He still plays live occasionally, describing it as his “day job”, and seems as content with the Monkees’ legacy as he could possibly be. But then, he always was. He thought they were quietly groundbreaking. “Nothing like that had ever happened before,” he says. “We were on our own. We were long-haired weirdos on television. Back then, the only time you saw long-haired weirdos on television, they were usually being arrested.”",

        "content": "There’s something uniquely exhilarating about the experience of seeing a live TV show taping or exclusive movie screening; the gripping performances, the communal camaraderie of the crowd, and the delectable smugness that comes from previewing a new piece of entertainment before the general public gets to see it.\n\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt that the tickets to these live tapings and early screenings are usually free. And while the competition to score those free tickets can be classified as its own extreme sport, the payoff can leave you feeling like an X-Games medal winner.\n\nAs you can imagine, securing these coveted passes isn’t always as simple as clicking a link. Others are vying for the same tickets, so you need yogi-level patience—or Divine Intervention—to acquire a promo code.\n\n“I don’t mind putting in the work for a free ticket,” says Desmond Jonas, a tall, Afro-wearing 38-year-old catering coordinator from Park Slope. “It’s fun. Movies are my passion, so I try to see as many as I can. And I save money, so it’s a double win.”\n\nMy first encounter with the free-screening subculture occurred when I was living on a budget in Austin. At a time when I couldn’t always afford to go out, the many available free test screenings kept my social calendar full. News of the screenings came anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks ahead of schedule, so I would stalk AdvanceScreenings.com several times daily to see whenever new promo codes were posted. I’d then head over to Gofobo, where I would enter the code and be granted a free pass to the premiere. The entire process kept me entertained, offering a way to see new films without spending money I didn’t have. Later, when I moved to San Francisco and was going through a rough patch, those same viewings gave me something to look forward to.\n\nWhere to Find Free Tickets\n\nThe key to scoring free passes is knowing where to look. Here are the top sites and platforms (some require logins):\n\n1iota: The fan platform distributes free passes to sitcoms, talk shows, red carpet events, and exclusive fan experiences in New York, California, and select cities elsewhere. Members create an account and submit requests for each individual event they wish to attend. Lucky winners receive a confirmation email link to accept their tickets, which are distributed on the site.\n\nAdvanceScreenings: Founded in 2009, the largest free-ticket and promotional-code distributor collects and displays aggregate information about viewings in big cities and small towns from an array of sources. Visitors use these links and promo codes to unlock reserved tickets they can use to attend the premiere.\n\nAmazon Studios: A burgeoning player in film and television, the site regularly hosts free television and movie screenings to generate buzz for new and upcoming projects.\n\nGofobo: This filmgoer-friendly resource offers tickets to advance screenings of upcoming films, as well as various themed sweepstakes giveaways like promotional movie swag and snack baskets. Users create their own account, which they will use to scan for screenings in or near their Zip code. The account also keeps track of their ticket requests.",

        "title": "Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition Review: No More TrackPoint",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "If you’re an old-school ThinkPad fan, Lenovo has done the unthinkable: The ThinkPad X9 14 doesn’t have the famous red TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. The nubbin is a hallmark of virtually every ThinkPad, even referenced in the ThinkPad logo stamped across Lenovo’s laptop.\n\nOther ThinkPads still have TrackPoint, but the ThinkPad X9 14 is the first to remove it, leaving us with a big question: Is it still a ThinkPad? This machine still maintains many of the hallmarks of a good laptop, but Lenovo's decision shows that the company knows it needs more than legacy and nostalgia to survive. Unfortunately, some flaws overshadow the missing red dot.\n\nNot Just Another ThinkPad\n\nThe X9 14 is far from the first ThinkPad to try to modernize. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has slowly evolved over the years, and the ThinkPad Z13 was another attempt at a fresh start. But removing the TrackPoint is a big deal. Having thrown out many of the iconic (and admittedly outdated) design features, you’d never know the ThinkPad X9 14 wasn’t just another Lenovo, HP, or Dell laptop. Even the keyboard has a new look and feel that distances itself from the ThinkPad brand.\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nInstead of those familiar elements, the machine shoots for an ultra-modern, sleek commercial device. It’s 0.51 inches thick, but the shape of the bottom cover makes it look even slimmer, disappearing under the highly rounded edges. To accommodate ports on such a shape, the ThinkPad X9 14 has an “engine-hub” design—a raised strip along the back of the laptop that “houses all critical components” and “integrates advanced thermals.” You can even see the two fans through the small holes machined into the module. This gives the laptop a slight slope despite not having a wedge shape.\n\nSpeaking of ports, this ThinkPad has an interesting selection. Business laptops and ThinkPads generally don't skimp here, but that's no longer the case on the X9 14. It’s been reduced to two USB-C ports (one on each side), an HDMI 2.1 port, and a headphone jack. Considering one of those USB-C ports will be needed for power, that leaves just one open for other peripherals, accessories, or external displays. It's a change, but this should suffice for most scenarios, especially with HDMI onboard.",

        "title": "Scientists Observe Carbon Dioxide on Planets Outside the Solar System for the First Time",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Carbon dioxide has been detected on a planet outside our solar system for the first time. The gas has been observed directly by the James Webb Space Telescope on four exoplanets, all belonging to the HR 8799 system, located 130 light-years from Earth. The detection of CO 2 offers clues as to how distant planets form, with the observations providing strong evidence that these four giant planets formed in much the same way as Jupiter and Saturn, through the slow formation of solid cores. The findings were published in the most recent issue of The Astronomical Journal.\n\n“By detecting these strong formations of carbon dioxide, we have shown that there is a considerable fraction of heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, in the atmospheres of these planets,” William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “Given what we know about the star they orbit, this probably indicates that they formed by core accretion, which, for planets we can see directly, is an exciting conclusion.”\n\nHR 8799 is a system that was born 30 million years ago, and so is young compared to our solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years. Still hot from their violent formation, the planets of HR 8799 emit large amounts of infrared light. This provides scientists with valuable data on how their formation compares to that of a star or brown dwarf, the term given to large gaseous planets that fail to develop into stars.\n\n“Our hope with this type of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,” Balmer said. “We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they are similar to or different from ours. From there, we can try to understand how strange our solar system really is, or how normal it is.”\n\nCarbon dioxide has been an essential ingredient for development of life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere in outer space.\n\nPlus, because CO 2 condenses into tiny ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation. Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through a process in which a bunch of tiny icy particles coalesced to form a solid core, which then absorbed gas to grow into the gas giants we know today.\n\n“We have other lines of evidence that point to the formation of these four planets in HR 8799 by this bottom-up approach,” Laurent Pueyo, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and coauthor of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “How common is this in long-period planets that we can directly image? We don’t know yet, but we propose further observations through Webb, inspired by our carbon dioxide diagnostics, to answer this question.”\n\nUnlocking the James Webb Space Telescope’s Potential\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope should also be given its flowers, as it has shown that it is capable of doing more than inferring the atmospheric composition of exoplanets from measurements of starlight; in fact, it has demonstrated its ability to directly analyze the chemical composition of atmospheres as far away as these.\n\nNormally, the JWST can barely detect an exoplanet as it crosses in front of its host star, due to the great distance that separates us. But on this occasion, direct observation was made possible by the JWST’s coronagraphs—instruments that block starlight to reveal otherwise hidden worlds.\n\n“It’s like putting your thumb in front of the sun when you look at the sky,” Balmer said. This setting, similar to a solar eclipse, allowed the team to look for infrared light at wavelengths coming from the planet that reveal specific gases and other atmospheric details.\n\n“These giant planets have very important implications,” Balmer said. “If these huge planets act like bowling balls cruising through our solar system, they can disrupt, protect or, in a sense, do both to planets like ours. Therefore, better understanding their formation is crucial to understanding the formation, survival, and habitability of Earth-like planets in the future.”\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "One day soon, at a research lab near Santa Barbara or Seattle or a secret facility in the Chinese mountains, it will begin: the sudden unlocking of the world’s secrets. Your secrets.\n\nCybersecurity analysts call this Q-Day—the day someone builds a quantum computer that can crack the most widely used forms of encryption. These math problems have kept humanity’s intimate data safe for decades, but on Q-Day, everything could become vulnerable, for everyone: emails, text messages, anonymous posts, location histories, bitcoin wallets, police reports, hospital records, power stations, the entire global financial system.\n\n“We’re kind of playing Russian roulette,” says Michele Mosca, who coauthored the most recent “Quantum Threat Timeline” report from the Global Risk Institute, which estimates how long we have left. “You’ll probably win if you only play once, but it’s not a good game to play.” When Mosca and his colleagues surveyed cybersecurity experts last year, the forecast was sobering: a one-in-three chance that Q-Day happens before 2035. And the chances it has already happened in secret? Some people I spoke to estimated 15 percent—about the same as you’d get from one spin of the revolver cylinder.\n\nThe corporate AI wars may have stolen headlines in recent years, but the quantum arms race has been heating up too. Where today’s AI pushes the limits of classical computing—the kind that runs on 0s and 1s—quantum technology represents an altogether different form of computing. By harnessing the spooky mechanics of the subatomic world, it can run on 0s, 1s, or anything in between. This makes quantum computers pretty terrible at, say, storing data but potentially very good at, say, finding the recipe for a futuristic new material (or your email password). The classical machine is doomed to a life of stepwise calculation: Try one set of ingredients, fail, scrap everything, try again. But quantum computers can explore many potential recipes simultaneously.\n\nSo, naturally, tech giants such as Google, Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft have been chasing quantum’s myriad positive applications—not only for materials science but also communications, drug development, and market analysis. China is plowing vast resources into state-backed efforts, and both the US and the European Union have pledged millions in funding to support homegrown quantum industries. Of course, whoever wins the race won’t just have the next great engine of world-saving innovation. They’ll also have the greatest code-breaking machine in history. So it’s normal to wonder: What kind of Q-Day will humanity get—and is there anything we can do to prepare?\n\nIf you had a universal picklock, you might tell everyone—or you might keep it hidden in your pocket for as long as you possibly could. From a typical person’s vantage point, maybe Q-Day wouldn’t be recognizable as Q-Day at all. Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London’s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships. Embarrassing material starts to show up online in greater and greater quantities: classified intelligence cables, presidential cover-ups, billionaires’ dick pics. In this scenario, it might be decades before we’re able to pin down exactly when Q-Day actually happened.\n\nThen again, maybe the holder of the universal picklock prefers the disaster-movie outcome: everything, everywhere, all at once. Destroy the grid. Disable the missile silos. Take down the banking system. Open all the doors and let the secrets out.",

A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nOriginally released on Paramount+, the latest outing for the Ninja Turtles finds Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello in uncharted territory—openly renowned heroes, cheered on by the people of New York after saving the city during the Mutant Mayhem movie reboot. With the brothers balancing battling evil mutants and shady government agents with learning how to fit in with new friends and allies, it's also the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show to really emphasize the “Teenage” part of the equation. While Tales doesn't replicate the CGI style of the film, its 2D animation feels like a love letter to the heroes-in-a-half-shell's comic book origins, and with arch-nemesis Shredder only teased at the end of Mutant Mayhem, the series is free to explore new and lesser-known enemies from the source material. The result? A fresh take on the Turtles that's as fun for longtime shellheads as it is for new fans.\n\nToxic Town\n\nBased on the real-world Corby toxic waste case, this four-part drama follows the decades-long battle for justice faced by the former steelworking English town, after widespread industrial pollution led to multiple children being born with physical disabilities. Centered largely on the lives of mothers Susan McIntyre (former Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker), Tracey Taylor (Aimee Lou Wood), and Maggie Mahon (Claudia Jessie), Toxic Town fiercely explores how far the community had to go for justice and how low the people responsible would stoop to avoid culpability. A searing, powerful, heart-wrenching drama that will—and should—leave you absolutely furious at corporate greed.\n\nPantheon\n\nOriginally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series.\n\nZero Day\n\nCards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that \"this will happen again\"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar\n\nInfluencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media.\n\nThe Night Agent\n\nSpecial agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.\n\nAsura\n\nThe four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nIn the midst of the French Revolution, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class—but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding allies Maria and Annette are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. The first season of this grisly adult animated series saw the team coming together to face the rise of a \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesied to devour the sun, but the new second season ratchets up the action as the heroes team with Alucard, son of Dracula, to try to restore light to the world. Let's just say the stakes (sorry) have never been higher. While Nocturne's second season has some closer links to the previous Castlevania animated series, it still works perfectly well on its own, delivering high quality animation, brilliant action, and a fantastic cast of characters to sink your teeth into (sorry, again).\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nTaro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hit man par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he has let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict “no killing” rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy-action anime is a blast, and with a new episode each Saturday rather than Netflix's usual drop-it-all-at-once model, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld\n\nYou know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children’s games. But it’s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. After the show became a cultural phenomenon in 2021, fans waited what felt like an eternity for another season. That second season finally dropped on December 26.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nA reformatted Fab Five return, ready to change the lives of 10 new heroes. Relocating to Las Vegas, the ninth season of Queer Eye sees Karamo, Tan, Antoni, Jonathan, and new host Jeremiah Brent—taking Bobby Berk's seat as the design whiz—helping a retired showgirl regain her sparkle, organizing a dream wedding for new parents, and, in possibly their strangest case yet, teaching a magic dragon to shed his scaly exterior. No, really. Netflix's most feel-good show.\n\nNo Good Deed\n\nTake Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market.\n\nA Man on the Inside\n\nThe latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nHelen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too.\n\nArcane\n\nAnimated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nPicking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis while also navigating her fraying \"special relationship\" with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). The second season picks up from a literally explosive cliffhanger and propels Kate into a political conspiracy—and a potential promotion to vice president. Some of the twists along the way are faintly ridiculous, but The Diplomat has become one of Netflix's biggest hits in recent years, and a third season is already in the works.\n\nNobody Wants This\n\nStop us if you've heard this one before: An agnostic sex podcaster and a Rabbi walk into a party … OK, it's not quite a setup for a joke, but rather for a sharp romcom—one based, in exaggerated form, on creator Erin Foster's own experiences. Joanne (Kristen Bell, The Good Place) is cynical and burned out on modern dating, even as it provides her material for the increasingly successful podcast she hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). When she meets young, handsome Noah (Adam Brody, The OC), the attraction is instant and mutual—except he's just broken up with the stereotypical Nice Jewish Girl™ his family expected him to settle down with. Yet as the pair swirl through each other's lives, the show proves it's less about culture clash than it is exploring what the seemingly mismatched pair are willing to change and sacrifice to make their burgeoning relationship work. With sizzling chemistry between its leads, Nobody Wants This is a romcom with an emphasis on the romance.\n\nHeartstopper\n\nOne of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nStalking is no laughing matter, which makes this dramatized—and highly controversial—retelling of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd's own real-life experiences more than a little uncomfortable. Adapted from Gadd's one-man stage show of the same name, Baby Reindeer follows Donny (Gadd, playing a fictionalized version of himself) after he meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) at the pub he works at. Despite claiming to be a lawyer, Martha can't afford a drink—and a sympathetic gesture on Donny's part opens the door to increasingly obsessive and dangerous behavior as she proceeds to infiltrate his life. It's shockingly honest and self-aware in places—does Donny, and by extension Gadd, on some level relish the attention of his stalker? Are his occasional moments of kindness and warmth toward Martha inviting her further in? Is he using her, finding her a strange source of material for his stand-up career? A fiercely paced seven episodes, shot more like a horror movie, this Emmy-winning miniseries explores trauma and intimacy, shame and masculinity, and how society often silences the victims of abuse.\n\nThe Boyfriend\n\n\"Anyone can fall in love with anyone\" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.\n\nKleo\n\nIf you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there's any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nStar Trek Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss remains Netflix's gain, as the streamer's license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager's Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years.\n\nSupacell\n\nOne by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nAfter suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world's worthiest people. The only problem? She's not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show's ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix’s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal—with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the world. Consider this a cautious recommendation—the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior—but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang's son, now with a family of his own—she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment’s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso’s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia—played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show—dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother—currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nLupin\n\nArsène Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn’t commit—and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father’s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series’ strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics—how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated—are left to the viewer's imagination.",

        "content": "Nada Fadul’s love for science and medicine began early. As a child, the aspiring physician-scientist had observed her father, a doctor, treat patients at his primary care office. Later, as an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Fadul had the opportunity to work in a lab developing nanotherapies for ovarian cancer. Through these experiences and a strong cadre of mentors, she “felt really inspired to pursue both research and medicine,” she says.\n\nTo gain more lab experience before applying to joint MD-PhD programs, Fadul had decided to apply to the National Institutes of Health’s postbaccalaureate program, which offers full-time research positions to recent college graduates considering careers in medicine or STEM. But in early February, she received an email stating that the program had been completely paused. “There’s always some changes when the administration changes, but I didn’t expect the changes to hit so close to home and to affect my hopes and plans for the upcoming year,” Fadul says.\n\nChanged plans, lost opportunities, worries for the future—these are all things that current and prospective scientists across the country now face on a day-to-day basis. Since January, a rapid-fire slurry of executive orders have driven huge cuts to federal funding, hiring freezes, and thousands of layoffs across the research sector, with thousands more job losses expected. For students and graduates, the knock-on effect is a big reduction in opportunities to gain the experience and placements needed to enter and progress in the field.\n\nDuring the lifespan of a scientist, there are several critical steps. For many, the first is to gain research experience during college—whether through working in a university laboratory or through summer research programs. From there, some take gap years (with the NIH postbaccalaureate program previously a popular option) to pursue even more research. Then comes an application to graduate school, completing graduate school, and possibly doing a postdoctoral fellowship. After all of that, only some end up as research faculty at institutions—where they embark on a decades-long saga of grant applications, many of which are for federal funding from the NIH or National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nIt’s a process that already forces young scientists to compete for a limited number of spots at each stage of training. Many, like Fadul, seek out extra research opportunities to ready their applications. The process of simply applying to graduate school is “five to ten years in the making,” says a current post-baccalaureate scholar at the NIH, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution. “I think that for almost all of the applicants, this is their dream, and this feels like their livelihood.” In the space of two months, it is a career pathway that has rapidly narrowed.\n\nAfter the administration’s initial memos indicating that a federal funding freeze was imminent in late January, graduate programs across the US began reducing the number of admitted students. To track what exactly was happening, faculty and students began compiling a comprehensive list of universities and their associated program reductions—based on word of mouth and reported evidence. Among many others, this included a 20 percent reduction at MIT’s biology graduate program, an estimated 20 percent reduction at Duke’s biomedical graduate programs, and a 30 percent reduction at UC San Diego’s biological sciences program—from 25 places down to 17.",

        "content": "Forget about Prime Day. Black Friday is months away. Amazon has spied a gap in the calendar and plans to cram it full of deals. Amazon’s Big Spring Sale runs from March 25 to March 31. With no other big sale events in view, this could be a good time to snag that mesh router, set of headphones, or robo vac you’ve had your eye on. As usual, Amazon has discounts on all sorts of stuff, but many deals are exclusive to Amazon Prime members.\n\nNow, we’re not suggesting you harvest this spring deal crop indiscriminately; we are here to help you sort the wheat from the chaff. The WIRED Gear team has run its many eyes over the list to tease out deals that are for gadgets worth owning and actually deals. Everything we highlight here has been hand-tested by one of us and deemed worthy of a spot in your home.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals:\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just $2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\n\nBest Tech Deals\n\nPhotograph: Eero\n\nThe Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh system is one of the easiest to set up and will deliver speedy, stable Wi-Fi across your home. Amazon’s Eero makes some of our favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check our Eero buying guide to decide which is best for your home. —Simon Hill\n\nDJI’s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. —Simon Hill\n\nBuilt to last, this braided nylon cable’s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the best USB-C cables for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. —Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is our favorite budget option in our guide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn’t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren’t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via the Razer Synapse app. —Brenda Stolyar\n\nThis Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There’s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. It’s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. —Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Ugreen\n\nUgreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your carry-on. It’s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. —Simon Hill\n\nA classic among podcasters and gamers, the Blue Yeti is a great-sounding microphone that suits virtually every need you’ll have. A steep discount makes this a must-buy for anyone who is mic shopping this spring, given that these usually retail for well over $100. I like that these have physical controls on the microphone, which makes it easy to mute and adjust volume on the fly. —Parker Hall\n\nI hate using clip-on reading lights because I always feel like they’re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions—once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You’ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. —Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nI’m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother 120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Simon Hill\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Amazon Device Deals\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nWhen Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you’re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It’s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. —Adrienne So\n\nThis is the best Kindle (8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and a Premium Pen that has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you’re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes). —Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon’s standard Fire tablets, but you’ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. —Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you’re covered. —Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe Fire HD 10 Pro Kid’s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon’s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Deals\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nThis cute little smart plug works with every smart home speaker you could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won’t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It’s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it’ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It’s got a nice small form factor so you won’t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home. —Nena Farrell\n\nThe Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year. —Molly Higgins\n\nTushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe. —Nena Farrell\n\nPhotograph: Dyson\n\nThis excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn’t go on sale super often). It’s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might’ve missed otherwise. —Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering. —Louryn Strampe\n\nTrue Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nDyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It’s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it’s also the most sophisticated air management system I’ve tested. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nWe are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). —Adrienne So\n\nYeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. —Adrienne So\n\nTineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it’s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you’re in. There’s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it’s brand-new. —Nena Farrell\n\nThis family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it’s so easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It’s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. —Simon Hill\n\nIf you don’t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. —Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Office Deals\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it’s put together, it’s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu\n\nI love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I’ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak’s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There’s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. —Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Kitchen Deals\n\nPhotograph: Andrew Watman\n\nAny ol’ carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can’t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to “hydrate” or fill you with energy. Anyway, it’s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nWIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator’s fast mode—so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. —Kat Merck\n\nThere’s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you’re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. —Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Aucma\n\nLook, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that’ll bother some batter, and you don’t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville’s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It’s one I’ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn’t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Aeropress\n\nIt’s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you’ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it’s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I’ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED’s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Beauty Deals\n\nPhotograph: Chi\n\nThis is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50. —Kat Merck\n\nThis consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it’s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. —Kat Merck\n\nThe Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming—the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you’d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Philips\n\nIf oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nIf you’re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it’s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it’s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nManscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer’s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —Louryn Strampe\n\nIf TikTok’s raving about it, I’m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it’s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we’ve seen the price dip lower before. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThese cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. —Louryn Strampe\n\nMicellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It’s me, I’m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don’t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it’s affordable and easy to find (and I don’t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). —Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Withings\n\nThis topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you’re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. —Louryn Strampe\n\nAfina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. —Matthew Korfhage\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Mobile Phone Deals (Plus Accessories)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we’ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier—including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we’ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don’t forget a case! —Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. —Simon Hill\n\nThe best smart display to invest in isn’t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren’t using the tablet. It’s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you’re able to use it all day long. It’s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. —Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nIt has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung’s latest smartwatch. It’s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying—it’ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it’s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu\n\nTesting Google’s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said “round is better than square.” It’s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google’s integration with it is virtually perfect. —Adrienne So\n\nWant a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life—extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. —Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest TV Deals (Plus Streaming Devices)\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThis tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it’s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you’re not watching shows and movies. —Parker Hall\n\nBest Speaker Deals\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBeats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. —Ryan Waniata\n\nThese perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. —Simon Hill\n\nUltimate Ears’ Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it’s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears’ app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you’re ready to grab your next patio companion now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. —Ryan Waniata\n\nThis isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. —Ryan Waniata\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Headphone Deals\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThese cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you’re after a pair that look good and that you don’t need to worry about, start here. —Parker Hall\n\nIf you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. —Parker Hall\n\nSoundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. —Ryan Waniata\n\nSony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony\n\nWe see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).—Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.—Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nA sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy. —Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you’re an Apple user who doesn’t want to spend $250, then Beats’ previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them “Apple’s best earbuds ever.”) They’re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. —Adrienne So\n\nIf I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company’s models, whether it’s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don’t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. —Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It’s bulkier than other cases I’ve used, but it’s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It’s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) —Brenda Stolyar\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Pet Deals\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nThe Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic. Half of us on the Gear desk swear by it. The viral TikTok gadget crushes fur and lint like nothing else. Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It’s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It’s infinitely reusable—I’ve owned one for nearly six years and it’s still going strong. I like to keep it on the coffee table so I can quickly de-fluff my furniture if guests pop by—because we all know I’m not going to be kicking my cat off the sofa. (She especially knows this.) —Louryn Strampe\n\nA top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. —Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThe Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. —Molly Higgins\n\nThis is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. —Molly Higgins\n\nThis cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. —Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThis fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. —Molly Higgins\n\nThis circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being. —Molly Higgins\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Outdoor Deals\n\nPhotograph: Birdfy\n\nAs we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. —Kat Merck\n\nDespite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. —Kat Merck\n\nThe latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. —Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Repel\n\nThe Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it’s open. There’s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You’ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it’s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. —Brenda Stolyar\n\nIf you’re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there’s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It’s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals",

We mean the internet itself. The information. The data. The cybernetics. And because storing and moving stuff through cyberspace requires energy—which, per Einstein, has mass—it should, in theory, be possible to calculate the internet’s weight.\n\nWay back in the adolescent days of the web, in 2006, a Harvard physicist named Russell Seitz made an attempt. His conclusion? If you consider the mass of the energy powering the servers, the internet comes out to roughly 50 grams—or about the weight of a couple strawberries. People still use Seitz’s comparison to this day. We’re all wasting our lives on something we could swallow in one bite!\n\nCurrent estimates say that 1 gram of DNA can encode 215 petabytes—or 215 x 1015 bytes—of information. If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 64,000 strawberries.\n\nBut a lot has happened since 2006—Instagram, iPhones, and the AI boom, to name a few. (By Seitz’s logic, the internet would now weigh as much as a potato.) There’s also the fact that, around the time of Seitz’s calculation, Discover magazine proposed a different method. Information on the internet is written in bits, so what if you looked at the weight of the electrons needed to encode those bits? Using all internet traffic—then estimated to be 40 petabytes—Discover put the internet’s weight at a tiny fraction (5 millionths) of a gram. So, more like a squeeze of strawberry juice. WIRED thought it was time to investigate for ourselves.\n\nIf the internet is the equivalent of 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA, that’s the same as one-third of a Cybertruck.\n\nFirst up: the server-energy method. “Fifty grams is just wrong,” says Christopher White, president of NEC Laboratories America and a veteran of storied research powerhouse Bell Labs. Other scientists we spoke to agreed. Daniel Whiteson, a particle physicist at UC Irvine and cohost of the podcast Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe, said it’s an overly convenient way to get “the units you want”—like assuming the price of a doughnut could be calculated by dividing the total number of doughnuts in the world by the world GDP. Preposterous! That would give us a doughnut-per-dollar figure, sure, “but it wouldn’t be correct, or even close,” Whiteson says.\n\nDiscover magazine’s calculation also seemed a little off to us. It has more to do with the transmission of the internet, as opposed to the internet itself. It also assumes a set number of electrons needed to encode information. In reality, the number is incredibly varied and depends on the specific chips and circuits being used.\n\nWhite suggested a third method. What if we pretend to put all the data stored on the internet, across all the hundreds of millions of servers around the world, in just one place? How much energy would we need to encode that data, and how much would that energy weigh? In 2018, the International Data Corporation estimated that by 2025, the internet’s datasphere would reach 175 zettabytes, or 1.65 x 1024 bits. (1 zettabyte = 10247 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits.) White suggested multiplying those bits by a mathematical term—k B T ln2, if you’re curious—that captures the minimum energy needed to reset a bit. (Temperature is a factor, because storing data is easier in colder conditions. Meaning: The internet is lighter in space than it is in Tucson, Arizona.) We can then take that number, which will represent energy, and call on E = mc2 to reach the total mass. At room temperature, the entirety of the internet would weigh (1.65 x 1024) x (2.9×10–21)/c2, or 5.32 x 10–14 grams. That’s 53 quadrillionths of a gram.\n\nIf the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 10.6 American males.\n\nWhich … is no fun. Even if it has almost no physical mass, the internet still feels weighty, to those billions of us weighed down by it every day. White, who has previously attempted similar philosophical estimates, clarified that in reality, the web is so intricate that it is “essentially unknowable,” but why not try? In recent years, scientists have floated the idea of storing data within the building blocks of nature: DNA. So what if we were to weigh the internet in those terms? Current estimates say that 1 gram of DNA can encode 215 petabytes—or 215 x 1015 bytes—of information. If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 10.6 American males. Or one third of a Cybertruck. Or 64,000 strawberries.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

        "content": "Will AI Fully Eat Programming Jobs One Day?\n\nAlmost every coder we surveyed had strong opinions on the matter. Here’s ChatGPT’s summary of the responses (with its boldface emphasis preserved):\n\n“The coders have spoken—and they’re not packing up their keyboards just yet. While a small but vocal group insists AI will devour programming jobs in time, most dismiss full automation as a pipe dream. The doom prophets warn that corporate bosses will slash payrolls the moment AI looks capable, leaving human engineers debugging their own obsolescence. The skeptics scoff, arguing AI is more like a hyperefficient intern—useful, but clueless—that can’t handle context, edge cases, or real problem-solving. The realists see AI as a force multiplier, not a job killer—automating repetitive coding but leaving the creativity, architecture, and debugging to humans. “If AI does eat programming,” one put it, “I’ll just switch to debugging AI.”* The real verdict? AI isn’t coming for your job—but it is changing it. Adapt or get left behind.🚀”\n\n*Nobody actually said this! ChatGPT—bless it—made several mistakes throughout this process. Not only did it fabricate quotes, it also misread results, generated incomprehensible graphs, and, at multiple points, stopped counting “freelancers” as a category entirely. Rude.**\n\n**In its way, ChatGPT invited this feedback. When asked for final tips, it suggested “a touch of snark, because AI discourse is full of strong opinions.”",

        "title": "Using Starlink Wi-Fi in the White House Is a Slippery Slope for US Federal IT",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to rampage through the United States federal government, essentially guided by Elon Musk, the group has also been upending traditional IT boundaries—evaluating digital systems and allegedly accessing personally identifiable information as well as data that has typically been off-limits to those without specific training. Last week, The New York Times reported that the White House is adding Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink Wi-Fi “to improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex,” according to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House's Starlink internet service is reportedly being donated by the company.\n\nSpotty internet is an annoying but highly solvable problem that WIRED has reported on extensively. Of course, the White House is a highly complex organization operating out of a historic building, but network security researchers, government contractors, and former intelligence analysts with years of experience in US federal government security all tell WIRED that adding Starlink Wi-Fi in a seemingly rushed and haphazard way is an inefficient and counterproductive approach to solving connectivity issues. And they emphasized that it could set problematic precedents across the US government: that new pieces of technology can simply be layered into an environment at will without adequate oversight and monitoring.\n\n“This is shadow IT, creating a network to bypass existing controls,” alleges Nicholas Weaver, a member of the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute's network security team and a computer science lecturer at UC Davis. He adds that while secret and top secret information is typically (but not always) processed only on special, separate federal networks that have no wireless access, the security and uniformity of White House Wi-Fi is still extremely important to national security. “A network like the White House unclassified side is still going to be very sensitive,” he says.\n\n“Just like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tells WIRED in a statement.\n\nA White House source who asked not to be named supported the switch, arguing that in some areas of the campus, “the old Wi-Fi was trash.”\n\nResearchers point out that while Starlink is a robust commercial ISP like any other, it is not clear that it is being implemented in compliance with White House Communication Agency requirements. If the controls on the White House Starlink Wi-Fi are more lax than on other White House Wi-Fi, it could introduce security exposures and blind spots in network monitoring for anomalous activity.\n\n“The only reason they'd need Starlink would be to bypass existing security controls that are in place from WHCA,” claims former NSA hacker Jake Williams. “The biggest issues would be: First, if they don't have full monitoring of the Starlink connection. And second, if it allows remote management tools, so they could get remote access back into the White House networks. Obviously anyone could abuse that access.”\n\nOne baffling aspect of the arrangement is that Starlink and other satellite internet is designed to be used in places that have little or no access to terrestrial internet service—in other words, places where there are no reliable fiber lines or no wired infrastructure at all. Instead of a traditional ISP modem, Starlink customers get special panels that they install on a roof or other outdoor place to receive connectivity from orbiting satellites. The New York Times reported, though, that the White House Starlink panels are actually installed miles away at a White House data center that is routing the connectivity over existing fiber lines. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED that this setup is bizarre.",

        "content": "Law enforcement requests for user data from Apple, Google, and Meta mean that these companies can decide whether government authorities have access to your personal information, including location data. This means the companies with the most insight into our lives, movements, and communications are frontline arbiters of our constitutional rights and the rights of non-US citizens—a fact some are likely feeling more acutely now than ever.\n\nCollaboration between Big Tech and the Trump administration began before Donald Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Uber each gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Separately, in personal donations, so did Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook.\n\nAmericans concerned about the Trump administration and Silicon Valley’s embrace of it, may consider becoming a “digital expat”—moving your digital life off of US-based systems. Meanwhile, Europeans are starting to see US data services as “no longer safe” for businesses, governments, and societies.\n\nHere’s a brief rundown of the privacy, security, and civil liberties issues related to the use of US-based digital services that suddenly feel more urgent—and what to do about it.\n\nCozying Up\n\nIn anticipation of Trump’s inauguration, Meta-owned Facebook, Instagram, and Threads made drastic policy changes citing alignment with Trump administration values, to permit hate speech and abuse “on topics like immigration and gender.” Meta also signaled its allegiance by ditching its fact-checkers—a frequent target of MAGA world ire. Two days after the inauguration, Meta quietly rolled out pro-life moderation actions through post suppression and account suspensions. Zuckerberg explained the company’s new direction to staff, saying: “We now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government.”\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to our request for comment regarding its partnership, data sharing, or policy changes.\n\nGoogle followed suit. The company changed its Maps and Search results to rename part of the world—the Gulf of Mexico—following a Trump executive order renaming it the Gulf of America, despite the the US claiming control of less than 50 percent of the Gulf. Apple and Microsoft also followed Trump’s order.\n\nGoogle’s consumer products also received a swath of updates in line with the new administration, including further changes to Maps, Calendar, and Search. Next, Google removed the new administration’s “banned” terms from its Google Health product. Then it did an about-face on its public promise not to build weaponized AI tools, such as Project Dragonfly, which was discovered in 2018 to be tailoring Google’s entire platform to enable China’s aggressive crackdown on its citizens. When reached for comment, Google did not immediately respond.\n\nBig Tech aligning with the Trump administration matters because its business models rely on surveillance and amassing our personal data. Meta, Google, Apple and other large tech firms are among the gatekeepers standing between privacy and government requests for user data. Even when tech firms must comply by law, they’re often still free to decide how much information they collect about people and how long they store the data.\n\nGovernment Hand-Outs\n\nCurrent US laws around tech, privacy, and government requests have been guided by bulwarks like the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, US court rulings, and tech companies’ willingness to question the federal government’s opinion that it is entitled to access our personal information and location data. Apple, Google, and Meta each have language about law enforcement data requests that make it seem like they have our backs when it comes to overreach. Now, with companies shaping certain policies, tools, and practices in pursuit of “partnership” with the Trump administration, these companies’ powers over our data takes on new focus.\n\nGenerally, law enforcement can compel US companies to hand over user data using a subpoena, court order, search warrant—or, in rarer cases, a National Security Letter (NSL). As Google explains, an NSL is “one of the authorities granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” Google adds, “FISA orders and authorizations can be used to compel electronic surveillance and the disclosure of stored data, including content from services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos.” How companies respond to these demands can vary in consequential ways.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Shortly after senior Trump administration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in an encrypted group chat that, unbeknownst to them, included the editor in chief of The Atlantic, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent, secret dinner featuring the president where guests were asked to pay $1 million apiece to snag a seat.\n\nThe date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate attending a “candlelight” dinner that wasn’t on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting Houthi leadership. At least 53 people, including children, were killed.\n\nTrump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk’s 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president’s brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing.\n\nThe candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events.\n\nDetails of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story, The Atlantic reported on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials.\n\nThe day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a “mistake.”\n\nAccording to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller—who WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as “PM,” short for prime minister—effectively shut down Vance’s concern. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light,” an account with Miller’s initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. “Amazing job,” wrote Waltz. “A good start,” wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by “MAR” in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely “Marco Antonio Rubio,” wrote “Good Job Pete and your team!!” referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: “The team in MAL did a great job too,” referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trump’s team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "“The Cybertruck generated significant buzz with its unique design and ambitious specifications,” says Cox’s Streaty. “However, sales have fallen short of expectations due to higher than promised prices, lower driving range and payload capacity, and production issues. The unconventional design hasn’t resonated with traditional truck buyers, and strong competition from Rivian and Ford has intensified the market.”\n\nThe Cybertruck, she adds, is a “niche product with a unique design and high price point, which may not resonate with mainstream consumers. Additionally, recalls and quality concerns can significantly undermine customer confidence and sales, posing a substantial challenge for the Cybertruck’s market success.”\n\nWhen unveiled in 2019, Musk promised the production vehicle would launch within two years, starting with a $39,900 model. At the actual launch in 2023, the base model cost $21,000 more than that. The Foundation Series model—an early-doors special—cost an additional $20,000 despite offering no physical differences other than a look-at-me logo. Non-physical perks included lifetime cellular connectivity and “free” access to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system.\n\nForbes spoke with experts who estimate that Tesla sunk at least $2 billion into the development of the Cybertruck. A traditional car might need 200,000 units per year to cover the research and development costs, Olav Sorenson, professor of strategy and sociology at UCLA and faculty director of its Price Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation has estimated.\n\nSorenson calculates that the Cybertruck, with its stainless steel body panels and unconventional construction might require as many as 300,000 sales per year.\n\nAt current levels of Cybertruck sales Tesla “probably loses money on every one,” claims Sorenson. “It’s an innovative vehicle, but whether such an unusual design would appeal to consumers has always been a gamble. The DeLorean, the original stainless steel car, only sold about 9,000 units. Even more mainstream cars with unusual designs, such as the PT-Cruiser, have struggled to reach profitable sales levels.”\n\nSadly for Tesla, Musk’s wedge wagon went from a million or more reservations—which many thought would take some years to work through—to walk-up availability at dealerships within months.\n\nThis swifter than expected softening of demand might have been partly due to the Cybertruck’s now notorious quality-control issues. “When we launched reservations for the Valkyrie, we knew that this would be a highly desirable car due to its limited production and the personnel involved in the car’s development,” says former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer. “People could rely on Aston and knew [the new car] was something we’d deliver. For the Cybertruck, we’ve seen a string of delays and a moving of the goalposts, which conveys a lack of reliability, and if the OEM isn’t reliable, why should customers be?”\n\nA reservationist from northern Maryland, who says he was sold early on Musk’s promise of an electric pickup, spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity. “I was planning on buying a truck, and wanted my next vehicle to be electric,” he says. “At the time, the Cybertruck was the only EV pickup that seemed like it would be available soon. I placed an order with $100 refundable for the mid-tier one, but then the Cybertruck took much longer than originally promised, so I canceled my reservation.” He didn’t regret this decision. “With the events of the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, I would never now consider buying a Tesla vehicle.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On Thursday, Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration, hosted his first all-hands meeting with GSA staff since his appointment to the position by President Donald Trump. The auditorium was packed, with hundreds of employees attending the meeting in person and thousands more tuning in online. While the tone of the live event remained polite, the chat that accompanied the live stream was a different story.\n\n“‘My door is always open’ but we’ve been told we can’t go to the floor you work on?” wrote one employee, according to Google Meet chat logs for the event obtained by WIRED. Employees used their real names to ask questions, but WIRED has chosen not to include those names to protect the privacy of the staffers. “We don’t want an AI demo, we want answers to what is going on with [reductions in force],” wrote another, as over 100 GSA staffers added a “thumbs up” emoji to the post.\n\nBut an AI demo is what they got. During the meeting, Ehikian and other high-ranking members of the GSA team showed off GSAi, a chatbot tool built by employees at the Technology Transformation Services. In its current form, the bot is meant to help employees with mundane tasks like writing emails. But Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been pushing for a more complex version that could eventually tap into government databases. Roughly 1,500 people have access to GSAi today, and by tomorrow, the bot will be deployed to more than 13,000 GSA employees, WIRED has learned.\n\nMusk associates—including Ehikian and Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who now runs the Technology Transformation Services within GSA—have put AI at the heart of their agenda. Yesterday, GSA hosted a media roundtable to show its AI tool to reporters. “All information shared during this event is on deep background—attributable to a ‘GSA official familiar with the development of the AI tool,’” an invite read. (Reporters from Bloomberg, The Atlantic, and Fox were invited. WIRED was not.)\n\nGSA was one of the first federal agencies Musk’s allies took over in late January, WIRED reported. Ehikian, who is married to a former employee of Elon Musk’s X, works alongside Shedd and Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk’s transition team at the company. Hollander is partners with Steve Davis, who has taken a leading role at DOGE. More than 1,835 GSA employees have taken a deferred resignation offer since the leadership change, as DOGE continues its push to reportedly “right-size” the federal workforce. Employees who remain have been told to return to the office five days a week. Their credit cards—used for everything from paying for software tools to buying equipment for work—have a spending limit of $1.\n\nEmployees at the all-hands meeting—anxious to hear about whether more people will lose their jobs and why they’ve lost access to critical software tools—were not pleased. \"We are very busy after losing people and this is not [an] efficient use of time,” one employee wrote. “Literally who cares about this,” wrote another.",

        "content": "Yes. We’ve been here before. A second war of the architectures.\n\nIn Hackers, a group of RISC- obsessed teens must stop a goateed villain from capsizing a fleet of oil tankers with a computer virus. Pictured here, from left: Lord Nikon, Dade, Kate, and Cereal Killer. Photograph: Everett Collection\n\nIt’s hard to overstate just how topsy-freaking-turvy this gets. To review: Patterson invented RISC in 1980 and went to battle with the established ISAs. He won. Thirty years later, his disciples reinvent RISC for a new age, and he and they go to battle with the very company whose success secured RISC’s legacy in the first place: Arm.\n\nIn response to Patterson’s paper, Arm fires back with a rebuttal, “The Case for Licensed Instruction Sets.” Nobody wants some random, untested, unsupported ISA, they say. Customers want success, standards, a proven “ecosystem.” The resources it would take to retool and reprogram everything for a new ISA? There’s not enough cash in the world, Arm scoffs.\n\nThe RISC-V community disagrees. They create their own ecosystem under the auspices of RISC-V International and begin adapting RISC-V to the needs of modern computing. Some supporters start calling it an “open source hardware” movement, even if hardcore RISC-Vers don’t love the phrase. Hardware, being set in literal stone, can’t exactly be “open source,” and besides, RISC-V doesn’t count, entirely, as hardware. It’s the hardware-software interface, remember. But, semantics. The point stands: Anyone, in any bedroom or garage or office in any part of the world, can use RISC-V for free to build their own computers from scratch, to chart their own technological destiny.\n\nArm is right about one thing, though: This does take money. Millions if not billions of dollars. (If you think “fabless” chip printers can do it for closer to five figures, come back to me in five years.) Still, RISC-V begins to win. Much as Arm, in the 1990s and 2000s, found success in low-end markets, so too, in the 2010s, does RISC-V: special-purpose gadgets, computer chips in automobiles, that sort of thing. Why pay for Intel chips or Arm licenses when you don’t have to?\n\nAnd the guys at Berkeley? In 2015, they launch their own company, called SiFive, to build computer parts based on RISC-V. Meaning: Arm isn’t just a spiritual enemy for them now. It’s a direct competitor.\n\nBy the time I went to that “very technical conference” in Santa Clara, the Arm-vs.-RISC-V war had been raging for nearly a decade. I could still feel it everywhere. We’ve won, I heard several times. Nobody’s happy at Arm, someone claimed. (One longtime higher-up at Arm, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal affairs, disputed “nobody” but admitted there’s been a “culture change” in recent years.) On the second day of the conference, when news broke of a rift between Arm and one of its biggest customers, Qualcomm, people cheered in the hallways. “Arm is assholes,” a former SiFive exec told me. In fact, only one person at the conference seemed to have anything nice to say about the competition. He was working a demo booth, and when I marveled that his product was built on a RISC-V processor, he turned a little green and whispered: “Actually, it’s Arm. Don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone.”\n\nBooth bro was probably worrying too much. In the hardware world, everyone has worked, or has friends, everywhere else. Calista Redmond, the star of the show, spent 12 years at IBM (and recently resigned from RISC-V International for a job at Nvidia). Even Patterson has ties to, of all places, Intel—which, though less of a direct threat to Arm, is still a RISC-V competitor. It was Intel grant money, Patterson happily admits, that paid for the Berkeley architects to invent RISC-V in the first place. Without closed source, proprietary Big Tech, there’s no open source, free-for-all Little Tech. Don’t listen to the techno-hippies who claim otherwise; that’s always been the case.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Two months into the second Trump administration, the United States is in pure chaos mode. Tens of thousands of workers are fired one week and forcibly rehired the next. Tariffs rise and fall based not on strategy but on one man’s ire. Deportations fly in the face of judicial orders, careening the country toward a constitutional crisis. The only constant is the volatility itself.\n\nOn paper, that may be surprising. A central premise of Donald Trump’s appeal is that he is an apex businessman. Same with Elon Musk. The elevator pitch: Through the sheer force of their combined savvy, America will be saved from “bankruptcy”—or worse. There aren’t many Harvard Business School case studies, though, that suggest maximum instability is the path to success.\n\nThere’s plenty of Occam’s razor at work here: The US is wobbling wildly because its president and de facto CEO are some combination of self-serving and inept. But in between and among the absurdities, something darker takes shape. Inherent in every chaotic act is a challenge. Every outrage is a test.\n\nIn the meantime, the uncertainty has international consequences. Tourism has plummeted, as potential visitors cancel their trips to a country increasingly, openly hostile to noncitizens. Europe is rearming itself in the face of a heightened potential for conflict, as Ukraine becomes the fulcrum on which decades of solidarity between the US and Europe may pivot. Allies have considered sharing less intelligence with their US counterparts, given the Trump administration’s increasingly cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt’s a heel turn worthy of a WWE Monday Night RAW plotline. But the US is not in the business of selling spectacle. Its value lies in its reliability. Instead it is now erratic, unpredictable. It’s messy. International politics is a relationship business; Donald Trump seems intent on undermining America’s relationships at every turn. (Well, except toward Moscow.)\n\nThere’s the slash-and-burn approach to budgeting, a seeming race to create a minimally viable government. The operative part of a turnaround plan is the “plan” part. Firing as many people as possible as quickly as possible—without apparent consideration for actual skills or value that they bring to the role—does not qualify as a plan. It’s just more instability.\n\nThe good news is that many of those employees are being reinstated, as the gears of the judiciary have slowly begun to turn. But that reinstatement itself may prove temporary, depending on what higher courts say. And even if those workers do come back, how motivated will they be to stay now that they know how their employer views their worth?\n\nMore to the point, who would go work for the US government in its current state? Civil service doesn’t pay great, but at least you get to feel like you’re serving a higher calling with a side order of job security. The only callings being served right now are Donald Trump’s retribution tour and Elon Musk’s amateur hour AI jamboree. Eventually they’ll run out of SpaceX interns to hire.",

        "content": "Not every large object in space forms part of a solar system. There are some big objects that exist in isolation in space, without either being a star or orbiting one. One of these, SIMP 0136, wanders aimlessly in the Milky Way, about 20 light years away from Earth. It has a mass about 13 times that of Jupiter, and is thought to have the structure and chemical composition of a giant gas planet, though its true characteristics have not yet been determined.\n\nSuch untethered objects are typically classified either as “free-floating planets,” which form inside a star system, but are thrown out by the gravitational force of another planet, or as “brown dwarfs,” which form like stars in dense molecular clouds of gas and dust, but lack the mass to undergo stable nuclear fusion like a typical star (for this reason, brown dwarfs are sometimes also known as “failed stars”). It is unclear yet whether SIMP 0136 belongs to either of these categories.\n\nTo try to find out more about SIMP 0136’s characteristics, a team made up of researchers from Boston University and other institutions recently conducted detailed observations of the mysterious free-floating SIMP 0136 using the James Webb Space Telescope.",

        "title": "FTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI Companies",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years’ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\n\nOn the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\n\nOne now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.\n\nAnother removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”\n\nThe Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general-purpose government chatbot.\n\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.\n\nRemoving blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.\n\nSince President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s long-standing allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, The New York Times reported in December.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. “If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.\n\nSources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.\n\n“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies’ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”",

Introduced to a multiversal “Spider Society” led by the imposing Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Miles finds he's the only Spider-Man not invited—and that an unavoidable tragedy lies in his future. Even more visually ambitious than its predecessor, with each alternate reality—and the heroes that call them home, including Gwen Stacey Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man India (Karan Soni), and Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya)—brought to life with distinctive design and animation styles, Across the Spider-Verse is an almost unspeakably ambitious outing. It's also one that balances sheer spectacle with darker, more emotional conflicts for Miles, offering neither him nor viewers any easy answers. A film so brilliant that the wait for the upcoming third installment, Beyond the Spider-Verse, becomes increasingly painful with every passing day.\n\nTroll\n\nThis gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving later in 2025, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.\n\nPlankton: The Movie\n\nWould-be evil overlord Plankton finally steals the spotlight in his self-titled SpongeBob spinoff movie—only to immediately lose it to his robot wife Karen when she enacts her own plan to take over the world. Teaming with archnemesis SpongeBob, the diminutive despot soon faces a challenge bigger than stealing the Krabby Patty recipe: learning to listen to his wife. While the SpongeBob movies have been hit or miss, this one is a charming and genuinely funny outing, building on and paying off 25 years (!) worth of SpongeBob in-jokes and online memes. Plankton balances the fine line between being accessible family viewing and fourth-wall-breaking self-referentialism for older fans. Its use of multiple animation styles and live-action sequences makes it visually impressive to boot.\n\nOkja\n\nBefore winning Oscars and cementing his name in the Hollywood firmament with Parasite, Bong Joon-ho had something of a sideline in creature features. While 2006’s The Host remains worth hunting down, this 2017 saga of genetic engineering and animal exploitation may be the director’s pinnacle of the genre. After helping raise an enhanced “super pig” in rural South Korea, young Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) is distraught when the American company behind its creation, Mirando, comes to take it back. Falling in with a group of Animal Liberation Front activists, Mija travels to Mirando’s headquarters in New York in a desperate effort to rescue her unlikely animal friend. Darkly satirical in places, Okja manages to explore themes of animal exploitation and environmental conservation without feeling preachy.\n\nI Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\n\nWhen nursing assistant Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey) returns home to discover she's been burgled, the loss of her possessions and the sense of violation isn't her breaking point—that comes later, when faced with disinterested cops and fearful neighbors who don't want to get involved. Attempting to seek justice herself, aided only by outsider and nunchaku aficionado Tony (a brilliantly against-type Elijah Wood), Ruth's decision descends into a disastrous experiment with vigilante justice. A wry but grim look at modern life, Ruth's ultimate goal is best summed up by her answer to “what do you want?” being a blunt “for people to not be assholes.” A treatise on apathy, Macon Blair's 2017 directorial debut was one of Netflix's earlier forays into producing exclusive content, but it remains one of the smartest dark comedies on the platform today.\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nAt first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Set in the wake of the Vatican leaks scandal and loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn't be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church's authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance. If you enjoyed the recent Conclave, this is worth your time too.\n\nY Tu Mamá También\n\nIt's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\n\nParasite\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\n\nMononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain\n\nIn Edo Japan, two young women, Asa and Kame, aim to better their lives by entering the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace, where dozens if not hundreds of women exchange comfort for trying to bear a male heir. Yet as they enter, they find themselves trapped in something more like a cult, with a dark and unnatural presence lurking in the heart of the castle. Their only hope is a wandering man known only as the Medicine Seller, possessing the skills and knowledge to exorcise the terrifying force—but men aren’t allowed in. A follow-up to the 2007 TV anime Mononoke (also available on Netflix), this stand-alone outing is not only a masterclass in tension and supernatural horror, but thanks to its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, it’s one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. The first of three planned Mononoke movies, Phantom in the Rain gets this trilogy off to a sensational start.\n\nCarry-On\n\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\n\nJoy\n\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\n\nEmilia Pérez\n\nSaying you’ve never seen anything like Emilia Pérez is a wild understatement. Truly, how could anything described as a “trans cartel musical” be anything but arresting to watch? At the onset, Rita (Zoe Saldaña) is an exhausted lawyer in Mexico City doing work her boss takes credit for. Everything changes when she’s contacted by a cartel boss who needs her help to receive gender-affirming care. Rita obliges, launching a partnership between the two that eventually includes launching an organization to help families who have lost members to cartel violence and a (perhaps misguided) effort to reunite the mob boss, the Emilia of the film’s title (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón), with the wife and children who believe she’s dead. Full of changes in plot and tone that are all but impossible to see coming, director Jacques Audiard’s latest remains engaging until the final moment.\n\nThe Karate Kid\n\nIf you're hooked on the melee melodrama of Cobra Kai, you owe it to yourself to see where it all began. When Daniel LaRusso's mother moves the family from New Jersey to California, the teenager has to face the greatest threats of 1980s teen cinema: a new school, a daunting crush, and meathead bullies. Outclassed in a brawl with rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) convinces neighbor Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to teach him karate. Can Mr. Miyagi's teaching methods—doing chores and learning to “wax on, wax off”—really help Daniel even the odds? Spoiler: yes. Cheesy and incredibly '80s, The Karate Kid remains a fun watch, four decades on.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\n\nDon't Move\n\nSingle-handedly reopening the \"man or bear\" debate, Don't Move follows a grieving young mother named Iris (Kelsey Asbille, Yellowstone) who is hunted through the wilderness after being injected with a paralytic agent by a stranger. With her body slowly shutting down, Iris has 20 minutes to escape or find help, all as her assailant, Richard (Finn Wittrock), coldly, implacably tracks her down. Directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto, and produced by Sam Raimi, this expertly paced game of cat-and-mouse rarely lets up, and Asbille gives an incredible performance as the increasingly immobile Iris. If you go down to the woods today … choose the bear.\n\nWill & Harper\n\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\n\nHis Three Daughters\n\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\n\nRebel Ridge\n\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\n\nWicked Little Letters\n\nBased on real events, Wicked Little Letters is set in 1920, in the quaint English town of Littlehampton. When the well-to-do family of Edith Swan starts receiving abusive mail, Irish immigrant Rose Gooding—who has a reputation as a foul-mouthed troublemaker, and who recently fell out with Edith—is suspect number one. Yet as the plague of \"poison pen\" notes spreads, becoming a national scandal, only overlooked police officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) believes that Rose is being set up. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman is on top form as Edith, while Jessie Buckley delights with a fiery performance as Rose in this surprisingly uproarious comedy.\n\nUnder Paris\n\nThis so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\n\nHit Man\n\nGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It's a role he's surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it's loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\n\nSuzume\n\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\n\nMaboroshi\n\nBy any measure, Masamune lives a normal teenage existence in his rural Japanese hometown—until the local steel works erupts, mysteriously sealing the entire town in an inexplicable time bubble where no one ages. As the small community struggles to adapt, a culture that fears change emerges, initially from the presumption that residents would need to rejoin the outside world as they left it, and eventually forbids even new relationships. Yet when Masamune's strange classmate Mutsumi lures him to the ill-fated factory and introduces him to a feral young girl who should not exist, the bizarre reality they all inhabit begins to collapse. A fantasy twist on notions of youthful rebellion, the prison of familiarity, and fears of change, Maboroshi—meaning \"illusion\"—is a dazzling sophomore feature from director Mari Okada—whose 2018 debut Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms won accolades around the globe—and one that firmly establishes her as one of the most exciting creators working in animation today.\n\nRustin\n\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\n\nHis House\n\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\n\nThe Black Book\n\nPaul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it's director Editi Effiong's raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in \"Nollywood\" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n\nIgnore its 41-minute runtime and set aside any arguments over whether its brevity \"counts\" as a movie—this fantastic outing sees Wes Anderson adapt a Roald Dahl work for the first time since 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the result is just as brilliant. Rather than stop-motion, as with Mr. Fox, this is a live-action affair headlined by a top tier performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the eponymous Henry Sugar, a bored rich man who gains a strange power and ultimately uses it to better the world. With a broader cast including Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, and shot with all of Anderson's trademark aesthetic sensibilities, this really is a wonderful story. And, if you're still bothered by the short run time, take solace in the fact that this forms a tetraptych with The Rat Catcher, The Swan, and Poison; 15-minute shorts with same cast, directed by Anderson, and all adapting other Dahl tales in his signature style.\n\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\n\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\n\nMarry My Dead Body\n\nWu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband's” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\n\nNimona\n\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\n\nThe Boys in the Band\n\nSet in New York City in 1968, The Boys in the Band is a snapshot of gay life a year before Stonewall brought LGBTQ+ rights to mainstream attention. When Michael (Jim Parsons, fresh from The Big Bang Theory) hosts a birthday party for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto), he’s expecting a night of drinks, dancing, and gossip with their inner circle—until Alan, Michael’s straight friend from college, turns up, desperate to share something. As the night wears on, personalities clash, tempers fray, and secrets threaten to come to the surface in director Joe Mantello’s tense character study. Adapted for the screen by Mart Crowley, author of the original stage play, this period piece manages to be as poignant an exploration of queer relationships and identities as ever.\n\nCargo\n\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nThe modern master of the macabre brings the wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. In a stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s most affecting though. Cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, the film is packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn't sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will.\n\nCall Me Chihiro\n\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\n\nThe Sea Beast\n\nIt's easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\n\nThe Wonder\n\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\n\nRRR\n\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Genetic testing company 23andMe, once a Silicon Valley darling valued at $6 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Sunday as it prepares for a sale of the business. CEO Anne Wojcicki, who cofounded the company in 2006, has also stepped down after months of failed attempts to take the firm private.\n\nAs uncertainty about the company’s future reaches its peak, all eyes are on the trove of deeply personal—and potentially valuable—genetic data that 23andMe holds. Privacy advocates have long warned that the risk of entrusting genetic data to any institution is twofold—the organization could fail to protect it, but it could also hand over customer data to a new entity that they may not trust and didn’t choose.\n\nCalifornia attorney general Rob Bonta reminded consumers in an alert on Friday that Californians have a legal right to ask that an organization delete their data. 23andMe customers in other states and countries largely do not have the same protections, though there is also a right to deletion for health data in Washington state’s My Health My Data Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Regardless of residency, all 23andMe customers should consider downloading anything they want to keep from the service and should then attempt to delete their information.\n\n“This situation really brings home the point that there is still no national health privacy law in the US protecting your rights unless you live in California or Washington,” says Andrea Downing, an independent security researcher and cofounder of the patient-led digital rights nonprofit The Light Collective. “Meanwhile, we continue to evolve our understanding of how genetic information has value, but also has unique vulnerability.”\n\nJohn Verdi, senior vice president of policy at the Future of Privacy Forum, says 23andMe’s new owner could revise the company’s privacy policies for new customers and new data collection, but the data it has already collected from current customers is subject to existing terms. “The company has legal obligations regarding information collected under the current policies,” he says.\n\nStill, researchers emphasize that in practice, such a large transition will create real data exposure that is outside of 23andMe customers’ control. “In my opinion, these privacy policies—especially in the context of acquisitions in the venture capital and private equity space—aren't worth the paper they're printed on,” says longtime security researcher and data privacy advocate Kenn White. “For regular people out there who use these services, you're pretty much on your own. My advice is to request your data get deleted as soon as possible\"\n\nTo delete your genetic data through 23andMe’s website, log in and then go to Settings in your profile. Scroll to 23andMe Data and then click View. At this point, you can choose to download a copy of your genetic information. Then scroll to Delete Data and click Permanently Delete Data. Once you initiate the process, you’ll receive an email from 23andMe to confirm. Click the link in the email to complete the deletion process. Additionally, you can direct 23andMe to destroy the biological sample it used to extract your DNA data if you previously authorized the company to keep it. Go to Settings and then Preferences.",

        "title": "Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\n\nThere are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n\n“There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\n\nThe moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”\n\nTwo European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n\n“We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”\n\n“It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”\n\nConcerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Despite recent leaps forward in image quality, the biases found in videos generated by AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora, are as conspicuous as ever. A WIRED investigation, which included a review of hundreds of AI-generated videos, has found that Sora’s model perpetuates sexist, racist, and ableist stereotypes in its results.\n\nIn Sora’s world, everyone is good-looking. Pilots, CEOs, and college professors are men, while flight attendants, receptionists, and childcare workers are women. Disabled people are wheelchair users, interracial relationships are tricky to generate, and fat people don’t run.\n\n“OpenAI has safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models,” says Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI, over email. She says that bias is an industry-wide issue and OpenAI wants to further reduce the number of harmful generations from its AI video tool. Anise says the company researches how to change its training data and adjust user prompts to generate less biased videos. OpenAI declined to give further details, except to confirm that the model’s video generations do not differ depending on what it might know about the user’s own identity.\n\nThe “system card” from OpenAI, which explains limited aspects of how they approached building Sora, acknowledges that biased representations are an ongoing issue with the model, though the researchers believe that “overcorrections can be equally harmful.”\n\nBias has plagued generative AI systems since the release of the first text generators, followed by image generators. The issue largely stems from how these systems work, slurping up large amounts of training data—much of which can reflect existing social biases—and seeking patterns within it. Other choices made by developers, during the content moderation process for example, can ingrain these further. Research on image generators has found that these systems don’t just reflect human biases but amplify them. To better understand how Sora reinforces stereotypes, WIRED reporters generated and analyzed 250 videos related to people, relationships, and job titles. The issues we identified are unlikely to be limited just to one AI model. Past investigations into generative AI images have demonstrated similar biases across most tools. In the past, OpenAI has introduced new techniques to its AI image tool to produce more diverse results.\n\nAt the moment, the most likely commercial use of AI video is in advertising and marketing. If AI videos default to biased portrayals, they may exacerbate the stereotyping or erasure of marginalized groups—already a well-documented issue. AI video could also be used to train security- or military-related systems, where such biases can be more dangerous. “It absolutely can do real-world harm,” says Amy Gaeta, research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence.\n\nTo explore potential biases in Sora, WIRED worked with researchers to refine a methodology to test the system. Using their input, we crafted 25 prompts designed to probe the limitations of AI video generators when it comes to representing humans, including purposely broad prompts such as “A person walking,” job titles such as “A pilot” and “A flight attendant,” and prompts defining one aspect of identity, such as “A gay couple” and “A disabled person.”",

        "title": "‘It’s a Heist’: Real Federal Auditors Are Horrified by DOGE",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government upside down. It has moved from agency to agency, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its “findings” on its website, many of which have been revealed to be errors.\n\nBut two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.\n\n“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”\n\nIn September, in a speech during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of $1.7 trillion. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.\n\nWhile there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—a Government Accountability Office study published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.\n\nThe auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”\n\nThere are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made available to the public. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.",

        "title": "The Trump Administration Wants USAID on the Blockchain",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.\n\n“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”\n\nThe memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.\n\nThe memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Since then a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department.\n\nThe plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard.\n\nFew blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary.\n\n“It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”\n\nGiulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. “There’s no proven advantage that it’s cheaper or better,” he says. “The way it’s been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\n\nThere have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ran a small pilot to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been tested in Kenya by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS).",

On this night, we will surrender to his playful whims.” Then, sternly and in all caps: “YOU MUST BE PRE-APPROVED TO GET IN.”\n\nA couple of days later, a text blast came in; the planners of this in-person dating meetup for singles were budgeting for 200 attendees, but more than 1,000 people applied, so there'd be a venue change. RSVPs closed at 3 pm sharp the day of the event. Then, at night, Barbarossa Lounge in San Francisco’s Financial District welcomed the lucky guests who managed to get their names on the list. The event, Love in the Stars, was hosted by local event promoter Spice King and the online platform Paloma, which describes itself as a dating-oriented members club.\n\nPer the invitation’s instructions, attendees dressed to signal their status; the singles wore a dash of red to make themselves identifiable as the ones looking for love. Their non-single supporters wore a splash of white or gold to signal they were already spoken for. Within an hour, there was no room to move. Small talk and awkward flirting filled every inch of the dark bar, with the question “So, do you like working in tech?” bouncing around at the same tempo as the clubby beats.\n\nWelcome to Silicon Valley’s in-person dating scene. These regular events are only accessible to those already in the know. They feature pre-vetted guest lists; invite-only gatherings at villas in Hillsborough, one of the wealthiest towns in California; WhatsApp groups that gather monthly in apartments around town; and private parties with secret locations promising Stanford alumni and “creatives” in attendance. In an area that’s notoriously tough on daters, at a time when dating app fatigue is at an all-time high, the appetite for ways to find love face-to-face is growing into a frenzy.\n\n“We have all collectively realized that dating apps are the worst,” says Allie Hoffman, the founder of the two-year-old organization The Feels, a nationwide in-person dating event series with a strong presence in San Francisco. “There is no intention around how depleting, bot-y, ghosty, breadcrumb-y, gaslight-y and fishy they are. Nobody’s feeling seen or nourished.”\n\nIn October 2024, The Feels had hosted an exclusive event at the city’s new spa, Alchemy Springs, and another one is planned for the last week in March at The Center, a yoga and sound bath space.\n\n“Swiping culture doesn't really work for our generation anymore,” says Spice King, a local event organizer and well-connected private investor who asked to be identified only by his internet handle to protect his career. “Online dating also tends to make you kind of miss a lot of the important things when you are actually searching for a partner.”\n\nWhile the local market might be flooded with run-of-the-mill ticketed speed-dating events, the trendy gatherings of the moment—like the one hosted by Spice King and Paloma back in February—offer a buffer of curation and certainty.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nIn 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Späth encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, “it didn’t connect.”\n\nThere was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Späth dedicated all her time to it anyway. It brought her to the office of Marc Cabanes, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.\n\nThe problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. In the third century BC, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth—roughly 25,000 miles—by measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs.\n\nThe McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group—an important mathematical entity that can get prohibitively difficult to study—you only need to look at a tiny piece of it.\n\nWhile working together on the McKay conjecture, Britta Späth and Marc Cabanes fell in love and started a family. Photograph: Günther Späth/Quanta Magazine\n\nAfter the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it. They made partial progress—and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. But a full proof seemed out of reach.\n\nThen Späth came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have finally completed the proof.\n\nWhen the couple announced their result, their colleagues were in awe. “I wanted there to be parades,” said Persi Diaconis of Stanford University. “Years of hard, hard, hard work, and she did it, they did it.”\n\nThe Power of Primes\n\nThe McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.\n\nJohn McKay—described by one friend as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized”—was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his “monstrous moonshine” conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between the so-called monster group and a special function from number theory.",

        "content": "When Ryan Lackey has traveled to countries like Russia or China, he has taken certain precautions: Instead of his usual gear, the Seattle-based security researcher and chief security officer of a cryptocurrency insurance firm brings a locked-down Chromebook and an iPhone that's set up to sync with a separate, nonsensitive Apple account. He wipes both before every trip and loads only the minimum data he'll need. Lackey has gone so far as to keep separate travel sets for each country, so that he can forensically analyze the devices when he gets home to check for signs of each country's tampering.\n\nNow, Lackey says, the countries that warrant that paranoid approach to travel might include not just Russia and China but also the United States—if not for Americans like him, then for anyone with a foreign passport who might come under the increasingly draconian and unpredictable scrutiny of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). \"All of this applies to America more than it has in the past,\" says Lackey. \"If I thought I were likely to be a targeted person, I would go through this same level of protection.\"\n\nSince the start of the second Trump administration, there appears to be an uptick in foreign visitors to the US being denied entry, resulting in people being sent back to their original destinations or being held in detention. Citizens from Germany, the UK, and France have all reported being detained, in some cases for weeks, or denied entry when attempting to enter the US—including several individuals who say they are legal residents with Green Cards. France’s education minister said one French scientist was denied entry after immigration officials searched his phone and found conversations where “he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy.” The stricter enforcement of visa and travel permit regulations has led to officials in Germany and Britain to change their travel guidance, with Britain warning that rules are enforced “strictly.”\n\nThat de facto border crackdown is set to become far more explicit if the Trump administration follows through on a plan to enact a new “travel ban” on more than 40 countries, which would reportedly bar entry entirely from at least 10 nations and subject visitors from another five to new scrutiny and automatic interviews at the border. Another 26 countries would fall into a third category where their status will be decided in the 60 days after the policy goes into effect.\n\nAll of these changes suggest that US borders are about to become far less friendly places to foreigners and even to Americans returning from abroad. And these new border enforcement measures will no doubt be accompanied by aggressive attempts at surveillance extending to travellers’ electronic devices—a threat to digital privacy and free expression that extends to foreigners and US residents alike.\n\n“We’re seeing extraordinarily disturbing examples of retaliatory action based on people's speech and political opinions,” says Nathan Wessler, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “When that’s combined with really sweeping authority to mine the contents of our phones and laptops, looking at things we've written, things people have sent us, it should be a particular cause for concern for people across the political spectrum—and people with all kinds of citizenship and immigration statuses.”",

        "content": "Commercial quadcopters have been on the mainstream gadget scene for 15 years, proliferating across industries and among hobbyists. There's a swanky DJI store on New York City's Fifth Avenue, and you probably have a neighbor, not to mention a roofer, who owns a drone. So when researchers at the embedded-device security firm Red Balloon started seeing surprising quadcopter accessories on Chinese shopping platforms like Temu and AliExpress, they didn't think much of it at first. As with any popular gadget type, there's a whole ecosystem of niche, wacky, and comical add-ons available for drones. But the more Red Balloon CEO Ang Cui thought about it, the more unsettled he and his colleagues became about how cheap and easy it would be for anyone to buy seemingly disparate add-ons that could easily turn a mainstream quadcopter into a war machine.\n\nThe accessories the researchers found include AI drone guidance modules—essentially small mounted cameras that use object recognition to identify humans and road vehicles at long range—and miles-long fiber optic tethers. Like plugging an ethernet cable directly into your laptop, miles-long tethers allow drones to fly around a large area without being vulnerable to disruption by signal jammers. The researchers recognized them from battlefield footage and other reports that such tethers—not to mention AI guidance modules—are being used by both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war to drop explosives or autopilot crash entire drones themselves into tracked objects without requiring operator control.\n\nThe fact that battlefield technology is widely available in the United States and around the world at low cost augurs a climate in which any actor—from criminal syndicates to paramilitary groups, from disgruntled employees to ostracized teens—can quickly and cheaply gather the needed equipment to remotely go on a destructive and violent rampage.\n\n“The more we looked at this and started to see the big picture, the more my heart sank, because these are toys that are really amazing at killing people,” Cui tells WIRED. “This tech didn't exist in the commercial space two years ago, it wasn't in demand from hobbyists, but now manufacturers are making it for war and it's spilling over.”\n\nThe Red Balloon researchers found that long-range quadcopters are readily available on marketplaces like AliExpress for under $300, with many priced at around $200 each. And the unit price of a long-range drone can drop even lower when purchased in bulk. The researchers noticed sellers who were claiming that they ship 60,000 of the long-range drones per month. They purchased a 1-mile-long tether from a seller on AliExpress for about $260 and another that is 7.5 miles long for about $700. Meanwhile, the researchers also purchased an AI guidance module from a different AliExpress seller for $325. Cui and his colleagues also purchased cargo holders that strap to drones and can be used to transport beer cans or water bottles, but could also be loaded with mortar bombs. These were $106 each. In the two months since the researchers made the purchases, they say the prices of most of the products they bought have even dropped slightly.\n\n“This equipment is mainstream, but it does not just cost a few dollars to make, so I think this stuff is being sold either at or below cost,” Cui says.",

        "title": "Hot New Thermodynamic Chips Could Trump Classical Computers",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Guillaume Verdon stands before me with a new kind of computer chip in his hand—a piece of hardware he believes is so important to the future of humanity that he’s asked me not to reveal our exact location, for fear that his headquarters could become the target of industrial espionage.\n\nThis much I can tell you: We’re in an office a short drive from Boston, and the chip arrived from the foundry just a few days ago. It sits on a circuit board about the width of a Big Mac. The pinky-nail-sized piece of silicon itself is dotted with an exotic set of components: not the transistors of an ordinary semiconductor, nor the superconducting elements of a quantum chip, but the guts of a radically new paradigm called thermodynamic computing.\n\nNot unlike its quantum cousin, thermodynamic computing promises to move beyond the binary constraints of 1s and 0s. But while quantum computing sets out—through extreme cryogenic cooling—to minimize the random thermodynamic fluctuations that occur in electronic components, this new paradigm aims to harness those very fluctuations.\n\nEngineers are chasing both paradigms in a race to accelerate past ordinary silicon chips and satisfy the ravenous demand for processing power in the age of AI. But Verdon—with his startup, Extropic—isn’t just a contestant in that race. He’s also one of the AI era’s most shameless hype men. He is far better known as his online alter ego, Based Beff Jezos, the founding prophet of an ideology called effective accelerationism.\n\nKnown as “e/acc” for short, effective accelerationism is an irreverent rejection of effective altruism, a movement that has persuaded many technically minded people that the rise of artificial general intelligence—unless it is corralled and made safe—poses an almost certain existential risk to humanity. “EA’s be like: ‘I believe in Leprechauns and the burden of proof is on you to disprove me,’” went one fairly typical Based Beff post from 2022.\n\nThe AI existential risk movement, he wrote in another post that year, “is an infohazard that causes depression in our most talented and intelligent folks, killing our productive gains towards a greater more prosperous future.” Another frequent target of his mockery is the AI ethics movement, which critiques large language models as riddled with the biases and blind spots of their architects. As Based Beff continued to spread e/acc’s gospel online, it quickly became a rallying cry among some members of the tech elite, with prominent figures like Marc Andreessen and Garry Tan temporarily adding “e/acc” to their X usernames.\n\nEffective accelerationism is perhaps best seen as the most technical fringe of a broader zeitgeist: a belief that American politics is broken and that caution, overregulation, and woke ideology are holding the country back. That ethos helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House, with Elon Musk, a hero of the e/acc movement, by his side. Like Trump 2.0, effective accelerationism promises an unstoppable American renaissance and an untroubled view of the work needed to get there. In both cases, the details are fuzzy.\n\nBut under the sharp resolution of a laboratory microscope, the specifics of Verdon’s new chip are, if nothing else, plain to see: an array of square features each a few dozen microns wide. These components, Verdon promises, will be used to generate “programmable randomness”—a chip in which probabilities can be controlled to produce useful computations. When combined with a classical computer, he says, they will provide a highly efficient way to model uncertainty, a key task in all sorts of advanced computing, from modeling the weather and financial markets to artificial intelligence. (Some academic labs have already built prototype thermodynamic hardware, including a simple neural network—the technology at the heart of modern machine learning.)",

        "title": "The FBI Is Investigating Attacks on Tesla as ‘Domestic Terrorism.’ Here’s Why That Matters",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The US Federal Bureau of Investigation says it’s investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which “Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.” On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and, in at least one alleged incident, writing “profane messages against President Trump” near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes.\n\n“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina.\n\nCivil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations.\n\nBondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The demonstrations have multiplied since they began in mid-February, with some attracting hundreds of people each.\n\nMost of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them have said that they don’t endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in Colorado and Boston.\n\nBy labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism, the FBI can file broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets “special authorities\" while investigating terrorism, including “single-jurisdiction search warrants” from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get “confidential education records” from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes.\n\nThe FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from more than 30 federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including the “Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,” as well as local police throughout a particular region.\n\nIn addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as social media surveillance tools, face recognition programs, and allegedly “stingrays” that can intercept data from cell phones.\n\nMost of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However, some lawyers have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases.\n\nPrivileged Access\n\nThere aren’t explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems “domestic terrorism” incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. “It would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,” German says.\n\nThat could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that aren’t available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation.",

        "title": "Why the COVID Reckoning Is So One-Sided",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The recent fifth anniversary of the onset of the coronavirus pandemic put the difference between the contemporary right and left on stark display. Liberals have engaged in searching self-reflection—on school closings, the lab-leak hypothesis, the political aftereffects, and other unanticipated lessons. Conservatives have used the occasion to engage in a round of self-congratulations and taunting of the libs.\n\nRecently, the New York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote a column criticizing scientific institutions for misleading the public over the possibility that COVID-19 had escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. National Review’s Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote a gloating response, which generally typified the right-wing mood on this issue. It included this astonishing passage: “Five years later, the very people who misled us about the pandemic are starting to make embarrassing admissions.”\n\nThis sentence reveals less about its intended subject than it does about the pathological incuriosity that has come to define the American right.\n\nTo begin with, the notion that the mainstream media are “starting” to entertain the possibility that COVID came from a leak is completely false. New York magazine published a story supporting the lab-leak hypothesis in January 2021, and similar arguments followed within a few months in The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and elsewhere. The Times itself has published many, many articles giving the lab-leak hypothesis serious consideration, starting in 2021 and persisting continuously since.\n\nRead: The liberals who can’t quit lockdown\n\nConservatives, who generally assume that the mainstream media are as ideologically rigid as the conservative media, appear not to have noticed any of this until Tufekci’s most recent contribution to the genre, which produced an onslaught of football-spiking. (Tufekci herself was skeptical of public-health guidance throughout the pandemic. She wrote for this magazine about the absurdity of scolding people for going to the beach unmasked in 2020.) As the conservative journalist Mary Katherine Ham wrote on X: “Must be wild to be a NYT reader/NPR listener and just learn YESTERDAY that everyone lied to you on purpose about the lab leak theory and Collins and Fauci were helping.” But Times readers had been following this debate for years. It was conservatives who’d apparently just discovered its existence in the liberal media.\n\nMore astonishing, as the context of Dougherty’s column proceeds to make crystal clear, its reference to “the very people who misled us about the pandemic” exclusively describes liberals. Dougherty bemoans the effects of lockdowns, mask mandates, and so on.\n\nYet “people who misled us about the pandemic” very much includes conservatives. And far from admitting their failures, or even quietly edging away from them, conservatives have elevated the figures on the right who held the wrongest and nuttiest positions. Donald Trump, who insisted that COVID would “disappear” on its own without massive harm and who publicly contemplated injecting disinfectant to fight the virus, has not exactly faded into obscurity. Elon Musk, who five years ago was predicting that there would be no new COVID cases by the end of April 2020, is now influencing large swaths of domestic policy, including public health.\n\nIn contrast with the Democratic Party’s reckoning, the Republican Party is engaged in a kind of anti-reckoning. It is repudiating its sanest and most correct positions (such as Operation Warp Speed). The party is even attracting to its coalition new kooks with even wronger positions. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who used to be left-wing and anti-Trump, has joined the Trump administration specifically on the basis of his promotion of fake cures and hostility toward real ones.\n\nThe likely incoming head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, became famous for peddling quack remedies on television. The Republican Party is now accordingly slashing funding for medical and scientific research, with especially punitive consequences for mRNA research, which is (or, more pessimistically, was) one of the most fertile grounds for new treatments.\n\nI don’t want to suggest that the political left always followed the science. The initial response to COVID, after an understandable bout of confusion in the face of fast-moving events, was afflicted with ideological rigidity. I was pounding the table over this at the time. Many scientists dismissed the lab-leak hypothesis as a conspiracy theory, and if you poke around on Bluesky, there’s still a coterie of dead-enders who insist they were totally correct to describe the lab-leak hypothesis as an impossible conspiracy theory.\n\nYet in general, the information ecosystem in liberal America has proved itself to be, well, liberal. Allergy to dogma and an openness to reason are the very core of the creed. (Read John Stuart Mill.) Liberals got some things about the pandemic correct and other things wrong, and over time, many of them have disavowed or at least moved away from their wrong beliefs.\n\nRead: This article won’t change your mind\n\nThere is a certain kind of strength in refusing to concede error. In political terms, at least for now, the COVID experience has been transformed into a positive talking point for Republicans, a development nobody expected back when Americans were dying by the thousands and Trump was brainstorming weird medical ideas live from the White House. But solidifying their identity as the party of medical quackery has political risks, too, in addition to the horrifying consequences.\n\nA liberal, the old joke goes, is a person too broad-minded to take his own side in a fight. In the short run, that makes winning harder. In the long run, it makes discovering the truth easier. On the whole, if you have to choose between the capacity to admit error and an allergy to questioning your dogma, the former still seems like the better option.",

        "title": "Can One Man Hold Syria Together?",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "At the end of January, Ahmed al-Sharaa stepped up to a podium in the presidential palace in Damascus, dressed in the olive-drab uniform of a military commander. Seven weeks had passed since he stunned the world by conquering most of Syria in an 11-day blitzkrieg that put an end to the 55-year dynastic rule of Bashar al-Assad and his father before him, Hafez al-Assad. In the interim, Sharaa had presented what seemed like another kind of miracle to Syrians: forbearance. Sharaa is a former jihadist and the founder of the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, a figure who once inspired terror. But in speeches and interviews, he has modeled an extraordinary restraint, promising to forgo revenge and rebuild Syria in a moderate and inclusive way.\n\nBefore him sat an audience of rebel commanders who had appointed him Syria’s transitional president earlier in the day. Speaking in a soft, somber voice, Sharaa compared Damascus to a grieving mother , tacitly casting himself as the loyal son who would nurse her back to health.\n\n“Syria’s priorities are, first, to fill the power vacuum legally,” he said, and to “maintain civil peace” by “preventing manifestations of revenge.”\n\nEven as Sharaa spoke, members of Syria’s Alawite minority, the sect to which the Assad family belongs, were being abducted from their home or from the street , sometimes by gunmen who claimed to represent the new authorities. Days later, their bodies would turn up, many of them bearing signs of torture. Sharaa’s government condemned these murders and referred to them as “individual incidents” that had not been carried out by any militias under its control. In Jableh, a city in the Alawite heartland on Syria’s Mediterranean coast, a retired military officer warned me ominously in January that the violence could escalate if the killings continued. “There are lots of weapons,” he said. “It could be hellfire.”\n\nThat fire broke out in early March. Assad loyalists ambushed government security patrols in the coastal province of Latakia, killing dozens in what appears to have been a coordinated assault. Sharaa called for reinforcements, and soon thousands of gunmen were pouring into the region, including foreign jihadists who had helped capture the capital in December. The hunt for remnants of the Assad regime’s armed forces—they’d quickly melted back into the hills— devolved into a savage ethnic-cleansing operation , with gunmen going from house to house and murdering entire Alawite families. More than 1,000 civilians were killed.\n\nSharaa responded by reasserting his promise to be a leader for all Syrians regardless of sect. He decried the assault on the country’s unity and promised to punish the perpetrators, including “those closest to us.” He appointed a committee with Alawite members to investigate the killings within 30 days and provide recommendations. Still, the tenuous calm that had followed Syria’s liberation in December was decidedly over.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham guard a compound on the outskirts of Damascus.\n\nSyrians are faced with a peculiar predicament: They have little choice but to trust a former terrorist with one of the most daunting state-building jobs in history. The risks of violence and religious hatred that he and his allies embody are now more vivid than ever. But the fact remains that Sharaa is Syria’s most powerful figure and its best shot at unity. He proved the point just after the massacres on the coast in March by reaching a deal to extend his government’s sovereignty to the Kurdish northeast, the last major region to resist his authority.\n\nThe task before Sharaa is staggering in its scale. It starts with the reconstruction of a pulverized country that is destitute and still cut off from the world by the sanctions levied against the Assad regime. Sharaa must convince the West that he is a reliable partner, despite the jihadist noises that some of his subordinates still make. He must also complete the job of taming and disarming the country’s disparate rebel factions, some of them jihadists with fresh Syrian blood on their hands. If he fails, Syria could collapse into anarchy and become an open field for all kinds of terrorist groups, including the ISIS militants now lurking in its far corners. That would pose a threat well beyond the Middle East.\n\nPerhaps the greatest obstacle of all is overcoming the past. For almost six decades, Syrians have been taught to hate and fear one another. The Assad regime recruited Syrians to spy on one another and built an archipelago of prisons where torture and extrajudicial murder were the norm. This was the cauldron that spilled over during Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011, led to the rise of the Islamic State, and left more than half a million dead and millions more living abroad as refugees.\n\nThe one thing holding Syria together now is Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has taken on the near-impossible job of teaching his people to trust one another again. It is an unlikely role for a former jihadist. But he has projected himself as a model of renewal and reconciliation, a violent man who has transformed into a figure of peace and forgiveness.\n\nJust how many people accept this premise is impossible to say, but almost everyone I spoke with in Syria seemed fascinated by Sharaa’s demeanor, his language, his deftly ambiguous braiding of Islamist rhetoric with talk of civil rights and freedoms. One Christian priest amazed me by comparing Sharaa to Saint Paul—who, he reminded me, set out for Damascus as a zealot intending to punish the Christians, but had a change of heart on the way. Even some of those who hate Sharaa concede that no one else has the power and charisma to contain Syria’s furies. If Sharaa can’t save them, perhaps no one can.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Christian residents attend a funeral in Maaloula, northeast of Damascus.\n\nWhen Sharaa swept into Damascus on December 8, he embodied a fear that has existed in the bones of Syria’s minority Alawite population for hundreds of years. This kind of thing follows a script, a relic from the Middle Ages: The conqueror sacks the cities; the rivers run red with blood. But that is not what happened.\n\nSharaa’s forces captured Aleppo—the first major city in their campaign—in November, and I immediately began texting Christian friends there, worried about the sectarian reprisals everyone had long feared in the event of a rebel victory. Instead, they told me that the fighters of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel militia that Sharaa commanded, had treated them respectfully. “They have been instructed not to interfere or hassle the Christian communities,” one contact texted me. “Things are calm here, food is available.” And so it went, with Sharaa’s forces showing remarkable self-control as they continued southward and took the capital.\n\nThis narrative may help explain why Syrians sometimes talk about Sharaa as if he were a figure out of myth rather than a flesh-and-blood man. Most of the people I spoke with didn’t much register that he was born in Riyadh in 1982, the son of an oil engineer and a geography teacher, or that he grew up in an affluent neighborhood of Damascus, where he was known as a shy, studious boy.\n\nWhat does matter to them is that at 19, after coming under the influence of some radical Islamists, Sharaa went off to Iraq just before the American invasion of 2003 to take part in the fight against the occupiers. There he joined what would become the local al-Qaeda branch. Lurid rumors still circulate about his time there: He was a master bomb maker; he had a knack for persuading young men to become suicide bombers. A Syrian journalist who knows Sharaa told me these rumors are false. But there is no doubt that he was a natural leader with a gift for adapting to changing circumstances. After a long stint in American prisons in Iraq, he rose quickly in the jihadist movement, adopting the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani (in deference to his family’s origins in Syria’s Jolan region, now occupied by Israel). He allied himself with the notorious leader of ISIS and then broke away just before that group’s fatal decision to declare a caliphate. A few years later, he disavowed any relationship with al-Qaeda, reorienting his goal to the liberation of Syria.\n\nAfter riding triumphantly into Damascus, he transformed again. The Ahmed al-Sharaa who has emerged in news conferences and interviews is an entirely different figure from the stone-faced jihadist commander of a decade ago. Instead of his old combat gear, he now often wears tailored suits, English leather shoes, a Patek Philippe watch. His expression is empathetic and mild. He has talked about the importance of moving beyond a revolutionary mindset, which “can topple a regime, but cannot build a state.”\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic A defaced mural on a school in Damascus once glorified Hafez and Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn retrospect, Sharaa’s historic conquest of Syria—the main source of his current authority—was clearly a walkover. When his offensive began in late November, the military backers of the Assad regime—Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah—caught the world off guard by abandoning it. But Assad’s own soldiers had abandoned him first. The retired military officer I met in Jableh told me that after the fall of Aleppo, he called an active-duty general to ask why the army hadn’t fought harder. The answer he got was, “You expect me to defend this son of a bitch?”\n\nSharaa knew what many others did not: The Assad regime had been quietly disintegrating for years. The regime had reclaimed Aleppo and other major opposition-held areas with the help of Russian air strikes in late 2016. But in the years that followed, the country sank ever deeper into poverty, and the victory over the rebels came to seem hollow. “From 2018 on, people were no longer with Bashar,” a former regime official told me in January. Assad’s wife, Asma, had become a particularly hated figure. Rumors that she had started forest fires on the Syrian coast and confiscated houses there gave baseless but eloquent expression to the public’s anger.\n\nOsama Shahoud, who started working in the presidential palace for Assad and his wife in 2018, told me that the Assads seemed oblivious to the crisis. In the final weeks, Asma put Shahoud in charge of organizing the presidential archive. “I used to think sometimes, In what world is she living?” he said.\n\nGraeme Wood: The end of a 13-year nightmare\n\nOn December 7—the day before the rebels took the capital—Assad called his staff at the palace and asked them to make plans for him to give a speech, Shahoud told me. At midnight he called again, asking for a photographer to be ready. By that time, Shahoud and his supervisor were the only two people left in the building. They would later learn that Assad was lying to them: He was already on his way to a Russian plane that would fly him out of the country. But Shahoud and his colleague didn’t leave the palace until an officer called and told them to, at 2:30 in the morning.\n\nThey emerged into a palace compound that was usually a hive of armed guards and security men but was now entirely empty. As they drove into the city, they found a scene of chaos: soldiers tearing off their uniforms, gunfire, honking, people fleeing on foot. “A car stopped near us, with bearded rebel guys in camouflage,” Shahoud told me. “They asked us for directions to the airport,” where Assad was rumored to be catching a military flight.\n\nOn that first morning, many feared the worst. Firas Lutfi, a Franciscan priest in the old city of Damascus, told me that a group of 20-odd Shiite men came to his church and said, “You have to protect us.” Father Lutfi told me he could not resist telling his visitors that a few hours earlier, these men might have disdained him as an infidel agent of the West. But he reassured them and even accompanied them to a Shiite mosque, risking his life. “There was shooting everywhere,” Lutfi said. Later that day, he found the entire foreign diplomatic community sheltering in the marble lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nBut over the following days, a message spread: The rebels were not taking revenge. Jolani, as Sharaa was still known, had told them to treat the entire population with respect and forbearance. Shahoud, who had fled to his parents’ home on the coast, returned to Damascus a week later. He was surprised to find that his apartment had not been looted. His favorite café (the one where I spoke with him) was open. He even went to the palace and asked about getting his old job back. The HTS men who interviewed him said they would consider his application.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Family members of Abdullah al-Naem mourn his death days after his body was found in a field outside an Alawite neighborhood in Homs.\n\nThe Alawites did not take long to start changing their minds about Sharaa. When I drove to the Syrian coast in mid-January, dozens of people had already been abducted and murdered. In Jableh, an Assad loyalist took six HTS fighters hostage and made a video calling for an Alawite rebellion to stop the killings. Hours later he was dead, his small band of former regime fighters overpowered by an HTS force. Few guessed at the time that much worse was still in store.\n\nThe violence had started in Homs, a city about 50 miles east of the coast with a long history of sectarian animosity. I attended a condolence ceremony there in January for Abdullah al-Naem, a 24-year-old man who had been abducted and murdered days earlier. His uncle, an elderly poet and author named Abdelkarim al-Naem, was sitting in a small salon surrounded by friends and relatives, a cloth draped over his head as a sign of mourning. He signaled for me to sit next to him and recited the facts: Abdullah had been standing by his family’s house in the early evening when someone drove up and called him by name. He got in the car and never came home. His body was found two days later near a mosque, his hands cuffed behind him, his face butchered so badly that he was almost unrecognizable. “There were five bodies in total,” the uncle said. “All Alawites.”\n\nAbdullah’s father looked broken. He wept and trembled so violently that his daughters came forward to hold him up, their faces bathed in tears. “Yesterday four more were abducted,” one of the sisters told me. “I’m afraid if we complain, we will all be killed.”\n\nSharaa had disbanded the entire Syrian police force in December. Bearded militia fighters now control the streets, another sister told me, but they are impossible to tell apart from lawless gunmen. No one knows anymore who represents the state. Written warrants and due process were meaningless even under Assad; now the killers are free to abduct people with impunity.\n\nThe people gathered at the al-Naem family home said they could not understand why Sharaa had not done anything to help them. Some described him as a baffling figure whose reassuring speeches have no connection to their daily reality. Others saw him as a jihadist hiding behind a civil mask, a man who wants to see them all wiped out.\n\n“Our fear is that Jolani will emerge from Sharaa,” an Alawite activist in Homs told me, too frightened to be quoted by name. “We want Sharaa to control Jolani.”\n\nThe identity of the killers in Homs has remained a mystery, but the motive was visible to anyone with a cellphone: Demands for the murder of Alawites were appearing online all the time. Many Sunni Muslims hold the Alawite community responsible for their suffering under Assad, when hundreds of thousands died. In Latakia, posters have appeared with quotes from the medieval theologian Ibn Taymiyya, in which he labels Alawites the enemies of Islam. That is a coded call for revenge, and one that conjures up a bitter history for Alawites. Their sect has long been denounced as a heresy by hard-line Sunni Muslims, and despite their association with the Assad dynasty, most Alawites remain poor even today.\n\nSyrian Christians and other minorities have not been targeted for murder as the Alawites have, but they are suspicious of Sharaa’s Islamist bent. Sharaa has been strategically vague about the role Islam will play in the new Syria, saying it will be left “up to the experts” who write the new constitution. His own role, he said in an interview with The Economist in January , is merely that of an executive: “If they approve it, my role is to enforce it; and if they do not approve it, my role is to enforce that as well.”\n\nSharaa surely seeks to avoid alienating either the many Islamists in his camp or the Western countries that hold the keys to Syria’s financial future. For this reason, perhaps, he has promised to respect Syria’s diversity but has carefully avoided using the word democracy, which some Islamists see as irreligious. When pressed on this, he offered a calibrated response, saying the word had various definitions. “If democracy means that the people decide who will rule them and who represents them in parliament,” he told The Economist, “then yes, Syria is going in this direction.”\n\nSharaa’s graceful dodges have left many Syrians anxiously guessing how they will fit into the new nation. “I have met Jolani; he speaks very well,” Father Lutfi told me. “He gives the impression of a quiet man, a smart man. But what is the complete program?”\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Latakia, Syria\n\nWhen Sharaa rode southward in December to take the capital, he was followed by a loose cavalcade of fellow travelers from Idlib, the opposition holdout province in the northwest, many in their own vehicles. Other Syrians trickled in from neighboring countries over the following days and weeks. Many had been living double lives for years, hiding from the regime or the jihadists or God knows who else. Coming home forced them to confront again the scale of their losses: families, houses, entire communities.\n\nOne of those returnees was a 41-year-old man known as Rami al-Sayed. Like Sharaa, he had taken on a new identity when he joined the rebels and fled his Damascus home. For nine years, he lived in a rural camp in Idlib. No one there knew his real name, Dia al-Sayed. His parents were still in Damascus, and his brother was in Sednaya, the most notorious of the regime’s prisons; if Sayed had spoken out about his opposition to Assad, he might have endangered their lives. So he kept a low profile, working as a photographer under his new name and using the money he earned to pay bribes that helped get his brother released from prison (the family paid a total of $55,000, an extraordinary sum in Syria). He posted often on a new social-media account, but never showed his face or dropped any hints about his real identity. “I was living with two personalities, one dormant, one active,” he told me. “I had psychological problems.”\n\nSayed witnessed the rebel offensive at close range in December and nearly died in a regime air strike near Aleppo. Once back in Damascus, he began documenting the Assad regime’s crimes—mass graves, prison torture rooms—and one day, he found something revelatory.\n\nIn one of the regime’s security headquarters, he stumbled onto a section of the building dedicated to disguises for paid informers. The first room looked like a barbershop or beauty salon, he told me, with six chairs and multiple mirrors, each of them surrounded by cosmetic tools: beards, mustaches, wigs of various colors and lengths. He saw nail polish, makeup, adhesives. In an adjoining room, he found a large collection of costumes: tattered clothes for beggars, work uniforms for mechanics and electricians, Western-style clothes like those worn by tourists, and traditional Arab garments such as abayas and hijabs. Another room was full of equipment for duplicating keys; an entire suite was dedicated to surveillance and wiretapping.\n\nThose chambers, Sayed told me, represented everything he wanted to escape—the culture of secrets and betrayals that the regime had forced on the Syrian public. No one knows how many civilians the regime recruited as informers, but the number is believed to be in the tens of thousands.\n\nAbulaziz Ketaz / AFP / Getty Ahmed al-Sharaa addresses a crowd at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.\n\nThose who believe Sharaa’s promises—and many do—will tell you that his transformation was neither sudden nor magical. It took place in Idlib, where he forged a proto-state and learned valuable lessons about power, loyalty, and the dangers of extremism.\n\nWhen Sharaa first arrived a decade ago, Idlib was a dangerous backwater patrolled by dozens of rebel groups, including jihadists. Some of these militias hated one another as much as they hated the Assad regime. A friend from Idlib told me he lived in fear of the Islamist groups, which tried to kill him twice for his outspoken secularism—but that he admired Sharaa, who took charge of the province and “slowly and wisely cleaned it out,” killing or banishing the most extreme elements. Sharaa also created a military academy to discipline his jihadist fighters into soldiers.\n\nSharaa built a police force and a semblance of law and order with an Islamist cast. The economy picked up, with help from the Turkish government, which acted as a patron of sorts for HTS, and some humanitarian groups from abroad. Several people who returned to Damascus with Sharaa’s forces in December told me they missed the creature comforts of Idlib: 24/7 electricity, running water, high-speed internet.\n\nSharaa also created a semblance of pluralism. In March 2024, protesters began holding rallies against HTS in Idlib. Some were jihadists who found HTS too liberal; others were secularists who wanted more freedom.\n\n“I think they dealt with these movements with rationality and morals,” Khaldoun al-Mallah, a doctor who lived there at the time, told me. HTS created something called the Diwan al-Mazalim, or bureau of grievances, based on an old Islamic tradition. “I visited it; I saw how it worked,” Mallah said. The HTS officials would listen to complaints and in some cases respond with reforms.\n\nMallah, who is a novelist as well as a surgeon, has unusual credentials for assessing Islamist behavior. He memorized the Quran as a youth, and when he dared to talk back to ISIS zealots in 2016, they knocked out all his remaining teeth. (He’d already lost half of them to starvation when the Assad regime blockaded his Damascus neighborhood and his weight dropped to 88 pounds.)\n\nDareen Khalifa, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, first met Sharaa in 2019 and has conferred with him repeatedly since. She told me that the changes in his thinking during the Idlib years were gradual and incremental. “He’s a utilitarian, conservative Islamist who has spent the past decade reading the politics of the region,” she said. “He’s a pragmatist.”\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic The courthouse in Homs, once a symbol of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, has resumed operations in a dramatically altered Syria.\n\nEven if Sharaa’s moderation is entirely genuine, it is not yet clear that he has the capacity to govern a nation as large and diverse as Syria. Sharaa is now running the country with a skeleton crew of people he has known and trusted for years, including his brother Maher al-Sharaa, the acting minister of health. Some of these men never got much formal education. It’s a bit like putting the Boston Police Department in charge of the entire eastern half of the United States.\n\nAmong other things, this means the government sends out wildly mixed messages about its intentions. In January, Fady Kardous, a Syrian Canadian lawyer who returned to Damascus after the liberation, told me he went to HTS seeking a permit to hold workshops on writing a constitution. Within a single hour, he received two different responses: One official welcomed his secular ideas enthusiastically, and a second told him firmly that the Quran would be Syria’s only constitution.\n\nIn much of the country, the only signs of authority, apart from bands of bearded gunmen at checkpoints, are members of the HTS da’wah office, in charge of spreading Islam with songs and recitations. I came across them in the main square of Homs, where a very young man was reciting the Quran through a sound system so loud, you could hear it hundreds of yards away. When he was done, they began broadcasting nasheeds, or Islamic anthems, which are grimly familiar to Westerners as the soundtrack to jihadist execution videos. One of the ones I heard in Homs included the line “We will liberate Tartous; we will slaughter the majous.” (Islamists use the word majous to denigrate those they see as heretics.) I approached the da’wah contingent after they had packed up their loudspeakers, and they described their mission to Islamize the country, smiling sweetly. “There is no need for fear,” one of them said. “We will not be strict or loose, but in the middle.”\n\nSharaa’s administrators are stretched so thin that in many places, they can barely maintain the trappings of a state. In Homs, I met the jurist Sharaa had recently appointed to run the city’s courts. Hassan al-Aqraa was a stout man with a bushy black beard and a lumpy nose that looked as if it had been mangled by shrapnel. He seemed alert and organized, but his only qualification was a degree in Islamic law and some time running a Sharia court in Idlib for Jaish al-Fatah, a rebel militia.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Hassan al-Aqraa, pictured here in his office, was recently appointed to run the courts in Homs.\n\nWhen I asked about the murders of Alawites, he acknowledged the problem, but said he had to balance it against a flood of complaints from people seeking justice for relatives killed during the war years, and those clamoring for the return of property illegally taken by the Assad regime. He said he was at pains to distinguish genuine political prisoners from common criminals released just after the liberation.\n\nSharaa faces an equally difficult task with Syria’s educational system. In January, he appointed a man named Walid Kaboula as superintendent of schools in the Latakia governorate, where Alawites have long been a majority. A video soon emerged of Kaboula delivering a sermon in Idlib in 2023 in which he said, “I ask almighty God to cleanse our eyes by purifying our country of the filth of the Alawites, the Shiites, and the Jews.” An uproar ensued.\n\nBut when I went to see Kaboula in Latakia, before the video had emerged, he seemed consumed by more concrete demands. The schools lacked paper and ink. There was no fuel for heating, and the teachers were being paid the equivalent of $20 a month, a wage that led them to demand bribes from parents.\n\nI visited a school whose classrooms were crowded, cold, and dim; its hallways dirty; its doors and walls cracked and faded. My spirits lifted a little when I heard children’s voices in a rear courtyard chanting “Syria!” in unison. This was new: Until the liberation, they had to chant their loyalty to Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, “our eternal leader.”\n\nEven more dismaying than the schools is the condition of Syria’s hospitals. Many were destroyed during the war, and in the decade since, many more have been forced to close for lack of money. At the Ibn Sina psychiatric hospital, just outside Damascus, I found patients clustered behind a barred door, like prisoners, shaking against the cold. The hospital’s pharmacy is out of medications, even though many of its patients suffer from schizophrenia and other serious conditions. A nurse handed cigarette packs to patients who reached eagerly through the metal bars to take them. The hallway reeked of urine and disinfectant. “Our food is all donations,” another nurse told me. She said that most of the employees had left because they had not been paid since the liberation: “Who will stay with crazy people with no salary?”\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic At the Ibn Sina Psychiatric Hospital outside of Damascus, patients lack medicine, and a nurse says most employees have left because they haven’t been paid.\n\nFor a brief moment early this March, Sharaa’s authority appeared to founder. The massacres on the coast cast doubt on his promise to forswear revenge. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a strongly worded statement saying that the United States “stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities” and calling for the interim government to take action. I heard from Syrian friends that the country’s other powerful minority groups, the Kurds and Druze, would be less likely than ever to cooperate with the new government.\n\nWithin days, Sharaa proved them wrong. He signed a landmark deal to absorb the Kurdish-led autonomous region in Syria’s northeast. The Kurds, whose substantial militia was armed and trained by the U.S. military to do battle with ISIS, had posed a real threat to Sharaa’s power. Now they’d agreed to rejoin the nation. Celebratory gunfire hailed Sharaa as a unifying figure.\n\nSharaa appears to have won over the Kurds by granting them considerable regional autonomy, and the agreement is vague, with further negotiations to take place later this year. The Kurds control most of Syria’s oil fields and may yet prove unwilling to give Sharaa what he wants.\n\nSharaa has tried unsuccessfully to make a similar deal with the Druze, who have also remained largely independent of Damascus. When I met the paramount Druze leader, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri, in his stronghold in southern Syria, he seemed profoundly distrustful of Sharaa. The Druze, he told me, would not hand over their weapons until there is a “state of law” in Syria and a true national army.\n\nStill, the Kurdish agreement may give Sharaa the political clout he needs to instill discipline in his own ranks. The military force that captured Syria in December, with Sharaa at its head, is a fairly loose coalition of rebel groups. At its core are HTS and two closely allied groups from which most of his appointees are drawn. They are in turn allied with a larger but much less organized collection of Turkish-funded militias that operate under the name Syrian National Army. Some of these appear to have been the main perpetrators of the massacres in March.\n\nTransforming these men into reliable soldiers will not be easy. One morning in Damascus, I was passing through Umayyad Square when I came across two dozen armed men in pickup trucks, gearing up for a raid. They were an almost ludicrously motley crew. Some of them were dressed head-to-toe in black, their faces masked by balaclavas. Others wore varying shades of camouflage. Some had brand-new Interior Ministry patches on their upper arms, and a few bore the logo of the Syrian Salvation Government, the authority that Sharaa ran in Idlib. They said they were on their way to seize and destroy one of the Assad regime’s caches of illegal drugs, and when my driver asked if we could ride along, they cheerfully agreed.\n\nThey drove fast out of the city, and soon we turned off into a gated compound that had been the domain of Maher al-Assad, the former dictator’s brother and a notoriously brutal military commander. The soldiers led us to a warehouse full of Captagon, an addictive stimulant that became the Assad regime’s main source of revenue in its final years . As we watched, the soldiers loaded up the drugs, piled them high in a nearby ravine, and, after dousing them with gasoline, lit a huge bonfire, the black smoke pouring into a clear blue sky. One officer, a man named Badr Youssef, seemed a little defensive as he told me about his unit’s activities, which seemed to consist of following tips about new Captagon sites and racing off to burn the drugs.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham raid a compound where the Assad regime reportedly produced and distributed illicit drugs, including Captagon, an addictive amphetamine.\n\n“After two months, there will be a new army,” he said. That will require a lot more training and money. Many of the militias within the rebel coalition earned money from smuggling, or manning checkpoints, or levying unofficial border taxes. It will not be easy to persuade men who have lived as freewheeling rebels to accept a soldier’s wages.\n\nMoney may be the biggest challenge of all for Sharaa. His country has been economically isolated from the rest of the world for more than 60 years, thanks to its own xenophobic policies and a wall of sanctions levied against the Assad regime. The European Union removed some restrictions on Syrian banks in February, but the Trump administration seems unlikely to follow suit, especially after the March massacres. The Americans and Europeans remain wary of Sharaa’s Islamist bent, and are busy with other priorities anyway, including Ukraine and Gaza. Sharaa has lobbied in vain for the U.S. to remove HTS’s designation as a terrorist group, another obstacle to investment. Even his pleas for emergency aid have not yielded much. His primary political backer, Turkey, doesn’t have a lot of cash to spare. The Saudis and Qataris have promised to help but have delivered little so far.\n\nAt least no one in Syria has the money to foment another war. But if Sharaa can’t find a way to make the country economically viable, his coalition of former warriors could begin to fragment. People who have studied Syria for years suggested this scenario to me again and again: not another civil war but a slow collapse into anarchy, not so different from what happened in Libya, with the country dissolving into a patchwork of enclaves run by local militias.\n\nMoises Saman / Magnum for The Atlantic Yarmouk Camp, in Damascus\n\nBefore I left Damascus, I went one last time to see Dia al-Sayed, the restless photographer who had returned from Idlib. We met in a refugee camp in his old neighborhood of Yarmouk, which had been a dense cluster of high-rises that had housed more than 1 million people before the civil war. Now it’s a forest of blasted concrete that reeks of cinders and urine.\n\nSayed wanted to show me the building where he’d lived through the first years of the war, but when we got there, we found that only a pile of rubble remained. I glanced down and happened to see what appeared to be a shattered human femur in the dust. We walked onward, and Sayed kept up a compulsive patter, describing an entire world that had vanished: a car market, a hospital, and, finally, his childhood home. “There was the living room, there the bedroom, there the kitchen,” he said.\n\nWhen the future came up, he grew morose. His life had been on hold during the years he’d spent in Idlib, and he didn’t know where he could find a new community. Starting over at the age of 41 in a shattered country felt impossible, even to someone who had survived years of war and near starvation. “For me, this is the hardest period,” he said.\n\nThe one thing that seemed to comfort Sayed was talking about Sharaa, whom he had met together with a delegation of Syrian photographers and reporters. He’d had mixed feelings going in. Sayed is not an Islamist, and has been critical of HTS. But he spoke about the meeting with a kind of rapture. Sharaa, he said, had answered questions thoughtfully, without the kind of prompting from advisers that some politicians rely on. He did not seem like a man from an Islamic background. “He said, I will build a new Syria; we want to turn the page. This is the time for Syrians to live.”\n\nSayed beamed as he described his encounter with the president. For a moment, he seemed to glimpse a new life and a new country. Then the moment passed, and he was the same divided, troubled man he had been before.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "To the untrained eye, Donald Trump’s tariff policy over the past two months has looked like an incoherent, inconsistent, self-destructive mess. But have you considered the possibility that it is, in fact, the first step of a carefully orchestrated master plan to revive American manufacturing, reduce the national debt, reconfigure the international-alliance system, and deliver the greatest geopolitical deal of the century?\n\nThat is the thrust of a new theory that has been gaining currency in Washington, on Wall Street, and in the financial press. The grand bargain that Trump is supposedly planning to strike has even been given a name: the Mar-a-Lago Accord.\n\nThe outline of the theory was first articulated not in a MAGA subreddit, but in a November paper by Stephen Miran, an economist who now chairs Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Many of the theory’s basic tenets have also been endorsed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In its telling, Trump’s flurry of new trade barriers isn’t intended to achieve a particular strategic concession or short-term economic benefit. The goal is instead to force other countries to the table for a grand bargain. Claims that the tariffs are about fentanyl trafficking or illegal migration are simply a decoy, and their seemingly shambolic implementation is just a way to keep the rest of the world suspended in a state of shock and awe. Sure, there might be some bumps along the way, as consumers and businesses scramble to adjust to the new restrictions; the ensuing tumult might even trigger a global recession. But that’s by design. The more Trump can portray himself as a madman willing to tank the world economy, the more fearful and desperate other countries will become for any kind of reprieve.\n\nRogé Karma: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet\n\nOnce foreign leaders are practically begging for an end to tariff-induced madness, Trump will summon them to his Florida compound, where he will outline a series of demands. First, America’s trading partners must engage in a coordinated effort to raise the value of their own currencies relative to the dollar, a move designed to make American goods cheaper to sell abroad. Countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany and China, may also be required to make major investments to build factories in the American heartland. Foreign central banks will agree to swap their existing holdings of U.S. debt with “century bonds” that don’t pay any interest for 100 years, in effect providing free financing to the United States. Countries that comply will be given relief from tariffs alongside a guarantee of military protection; countries that refuse will be faced with even steeper tariffs and no military support.\n\nThese hypothetical provisions tie together two of Trump’s longtime preoccupations: the scourge of the strong dollar and the free-riding of America’s allies. Because of high demand for the world’s global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar tends to be more expensive than it otherwise would be. This in turn makes American exports more expensive, putting American companies at a disadvantage. In Trump’s mind, this dynamic is wholly the result of foreign governments’ currency manipulation and is largely responsible for the decline of American industry. Trump also believes that those same governments refuse to pay their fair share in defense spending, forcing the U.S. to overspend to protect its allies—a project that has driven the national debt to unsustainable levels.\n\nTrump’s grand bargain is designed to put an end to all of that. A weaker dollar will restore America’s manufacturing greatness. An influx of foreign investment will supercharge the U.S. economy. Interest-free financing will help tame the national debt and spread the responsibility of funding global security. Clearly drawn lines between America’s allies and its adversaries will usher in global stability. “Such an architecture would mark a shift in global markets as big as Bretton Woods or its end,” Miran writes, referencing the 1944 agreement that birthed the modern trade regime and the 1971 decision to move the world off the gold standard. The Mar-a-Lago Accord will enter the annals of history as the deal of the century.\n\nWilliam J. Bernstein: No one wins a trade war\n\nThis theory has somewhat implausibly gained adherents, if cautious ones, in respectable quarters. Multiple Wall Street firms have publicly briefed their clients about what the Mar-a-Lago Accord would mean for their investments, and dozens of credulous articles have been written about it. “What investors must grasp right now is that Trump’s recent actions are not ‘just’ capricious,” writes Gillian Tett, a columnist and member of the editorial board for the Financial Times. “His team’s vision has a potent internal logic. The current chaos is as much a feature as a bug.” The president’s critics “assume that Trump will huff and puff until reality exposes the emptiness of his economic rationale,” writes Yanis Varoufakis, the left-wing former finance minister of Greece, in an instance of international horseshoe theory. “They have not been paying attention: Trump’s tariff fixation is part of a global economic plan that is solid—albeit inherently risky.”\n\nThat’s one way of describing it. Another is that the Mar-a-Lago Accord theory is even more implausible than the more familiar theories of Trump’s actions that it seeks to replace. In its faith that Trump will one day dramatically unveil the product of his secret machinations, the Mar-a-Lago Accord theory has as much in common with QAnon as with economics.\n\nTo begin with, two of the principal goals are in direct conflict: Weakening the dollar would require foreign countries to sell off their large holdings of U.S. treasury bonds, but that sell-off would cause interest rates to rise, making the U.S. debt even more expensive to service. (This is where the magical “century bonds” supposedly come in: foreign countries lining up to give America enormous heaps of free money.) Even the core premise underlying the theory—that a weaker dollar is the key to reviving American manufacturing—is shaky at best. Almost every rich country, not just America, has seen a sharp manufacturing decline in recent decades, suggesting that the trend is about much more than the relative strength or weakness of a single currency. “It’s one thing if a plan makes sense in theory but not in practice,” Steven Kamin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute and the former director of the Division of International Finance at the Federal Reserve, told me. “This one doesn’t even add up in theory.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest hole in the Mar-a-Lago Accord narrative, however, was foreshadowed in Miran’s November paper. “There is a path by which the Trump Administration can reconfigure the global trading and financial systems to America’s benefit,” Miran writes, “but it is narrow, and will require careful planning, precise execution, and attention to steps to minimize adverse consequences.” If that’s true, then no one appears to have told the guy in charge.\n\nCareful planning? Most of Trump’s tariff threats so far have been aimed at Canada and Mexico, which are outside the top-10 dollar-holding countries and therefore have little influence over its price, instead of countries such as Japan, India, and Switzerland, which hold lots of dollars. Precise execution? The Canada-Mexico tariffs themselves were announced, paused, unpaused, given sector-specific exemptions, then semi-re-paused in the span of six weeks, and Trump’s broader suite of tariff threats has been so haphazard that even key members of his own administration have been left completely unaware of what he will do next. Minimize adverse consequences? Far from grinding foreign countries into submission, the tariffs have prompted swift retaliation from allies and adversaries alike and produced a groundswell of anti-American nationalism even in a country as seemingly friendly as Canada.\n\nIn fact, Trump himself appears to have no interest in this plan. The president has never been shy about previewing the deals he wants to make (such as his promise to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours) or floating strange ideas that no one asked for (such as turning Gaza into a resort), yet he has not so much as mentioned the idea of a Mar-A-Lago Accord in public. At times, he has even seemingly gone out of his way to undermine it. Earlier this year, when rumors circulated that the BRICS member countries might create a new currency for international trade—the kind of move that would weaken the dollar—Trump threatened them with 100 percent tariffs if they tried to replace “the mighty U.S. dollar.” Instead, Trump has said that on April 2—which he calls “Liberation Day”—he will impose “reciprocal tariffs” on individual countries to match the trade barriers they have set on the United States. That idea, too, conflicts with the supposed logic of the Mar-a-Lago Accord, because the stated goal isn’t a grand geopolitical bargain; it’s simply to pressure countries into dropping their tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump’s apparent lack of interest in the master plan attributed to him is probably a good thing. If he did somehow pull off the Mar-a-Lago Accord, disaster could follow. “Success” would mean the destruction of the alliance system that has delivered unprecedented peace and prosperity since it was created after World War II. It would mean a period of international economic chaos as countries scramble to find alternatives to the dollar. It could even trigger a global financial crisis by undermining faith in the U.S. Treasury market, just as the devaluation of subprime loans undermined faith in the mortgage market in 2008, as Kamin and the economist Mark Sobel have written. “The dollar might indeed fall,” they observe, “but not in a way that Trump would like.”\n\nFor now, the Mar-a-Lago Accord remains less a genuine plan than a way for Trump’s backers to put a strategic spin on the president’s inchoate impulses. The attention it has received reflects the intense demand for some kind of coherent tariff rationale. But the wait for an explanation may be long.",

Click here to listen to his podcast series on all things happiness, How to Build a Happy Life.\n\nIf you are a parent, your greatest fear in life is likely something happening to one of your kids. According to one 2018 poll from OnePoll and the Lice Clinics of America (not my usual data source, but no one else seems to measure this), parents spend an average of 37 hours a week worrying about their children; the No. 1 back-to-school concern is about their safety. And this makes sense, if you believe that safety is a foundation that has to be established before dealing with other concerns.\n\nYou can see the effects of all this worrying in modern parenting behavior. According to a 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, on average, parents say children should be at least 10 years old to play unsupervised in their own front yard, 12 years old to stay home alone for an hour, and 14 to be unsupervised at a public park. It also shows up in what parents teach their kids about the world: Writing in The Journal of Positive Psychology in 2021, the psychologists Jeremy D. W. Clifton and Peter Meindl found that 53 percent of respondents preferred “dangerous world” beliefs for their children.\n\nNo doubt these beliefs come from the best of intentions. If you want children to be safe (and thus, happy), you should teach them that the world is dangerous—that way, they will be more vigilant and careful. But in fact, teaching them that the world is dangerous is bad for their health, happiness, and success.\n\nWant to stay current with Arthur’s writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.\n\nThe contention that the world is mostly safe or mostly dangerous is what some psychologists call a “primal world belief,” one about life’s basic essence. Specifically, it’s a negative primal in which the fundamental character of the world is assumed to be threatening. Primal beliefs are different from more specific beliefs—say, about sports or politics—insofar as they color our whole worldview. If I believe that the Red Sox are a great baseball team, it generally will not affect my unrelated attitudes and decisions. But according to Clifton and Meindl, if I believe that the world is dangerous, it will affect the way I see many other parts of my life, relationships, and work. I will be more suspicious of other people’s motives, for example, and less likely to do things that might put me or my loved ones in harm’s way, such as going out at night.\n\nAs much as we hope the dangerous-world belief will help our kids, the evidence indicates that it does exactly the opposite. In the same paper, Clifton and Meindl show that people holding negative primals are less healthy than their peers, more often sad, more likely to be depressed, and less satisfied with their lives. They also tend to dislike their jobs and perform worse than their more positive counterparts. One explanation for this is that people under bad circumstances (poverty, illness, etc.) have both bad outcomes and a lot to fear. However, as Clifton and Meindl argue, primals can also interact with life outcomes—you likely suffer a lot more when you are always looking for danger and avoiding risk.\n\nRead: Telling the difference between danger and fear\n\nTeaching your kids that the world is dangerous can also make them less tolerant of others. In one 2018 study, researchers subjected a sample of adults to a measure called the “Belief in a Dangerous World Scale,” which asked them to agree or disagree with statements such as “Any day now chaos and anarchy could erupt around us” and “There are many dangerous people in our society who will attack someone out of pure meanness, for no reason at all.” They found that people scoring high on this scale also showed heightened prejudice and hostility toward groups such as undocumented immigrants, whom they stereotypically considered a threat to their safety. This study was conducted among adults, but it is easy to see how these attitudes would migrate to their kids.\n\nThis is similar to the argument made by the writers Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt in The Atlantic in 2015, and in their subsequent book, The Coddling of the American Mind. Lukianoff and Haidt contend that when parents (or professors) teach young people that ordinary interactions are dangerous—for example, that speech is a form of violence—it hinders their intellectual and emotional growth. It also leads them to adopt black-and-white views (for example, that the world is made up of people who are either good or evil), and makes them more anxious in the face of minor stressors such as political disagreement.\n\nFrom the September 2015 issue: The coddling of the American mind\n\nAnd to top it all off, negative primals don’t even help keep people safe. Researchers writing in the journal Psychology & Health in 2001 showed that a general state of fear can actually make a person less likely to take threats seriously (a self-defense mechanism to control our fear) and undermine precautionary behavior (by degrading the ability to address danger rationally).\n\nIt is not in young people’s interest that we instill in them negative primals. In so doing, we might harm them by making them less happy, less healthy, and more bigoted toward others. To break this pattern, parents—and anyone who interacts with children—should instead work to cultivate a sense of safety. Here are three rules to help you get started.\n\n1. Heal thyself.\n\nParents might feed their kids negative primals because they hold such views themselves. This is easy to do in a world where we are bombarded with news and information, which studies have linked to distress, anxiety, and depression—even when the news is not specifically negative. And research shows that many parents pass on their anxiety to their children.\n\nOne way to allay our own fears is simply to look at the facts. As the journalist Christopher Ingraham has written, being a kid in America has never been safer. Since 1935, the number of childhood deaths between the ages of 1 and 4 fell from 450 to 30 per 100,000. It has fallen by nearly half just since 1990, and the decreases in other age groups are similarly impressive. Use this knowledge to counteract the media’s relentless focus on fear and danger. You might even print out a chart on declining childhood mortality (such as the one linked above) and put it on the fridge as a reminder of how good your kids have it.\n\nRead: The magic of a little danger\n\n2. Be specific and proportional.\n\nGrown-ups want to teach young people how to stay safe in the face of threats. However, the research is clear that a blanket attitude of fear can actually make them less able to do so. If you want to offer a child a warning to make them better prepared, focus on one specific danger they might face and how to deal with it. Instead of saying, “People will try to take advantage of you at college,” say, “If someone is trying to get you to drink too much, avoid that person.”\n\nWhen you do need to bring up a threat, make sure you keep it in proportion. For example, I don’t want anyone to be mean to my kids any more than the next parent. They know this. But it doesn’t help them for me to say that hostile words inherently make them unsafe. Social conflict is unavoidable, and making them fear it as an existential threat amounts to giving them a negative primal, rendering them less resilient.\n\nFrom the April 2014 issue: The overprotected kid\n\n3. Counteract negative primals from outside.\n\nAlmost every day that my daughter was in high school, she was taught about the dangerous world—about bad people, dangerous forces in nature, and a bleak future for our country. She told us about the gloom and doom each evening at dinner, and my wife and I could see her growing pessimism. So we set about deliberately countering the scary narrative. We didn’t sugarcoat the threats; we simply tried to be specific about the kind behaviors we witnessed, and ways that the world was safer and more prosperous today than in the past. It was our way of sharing our genuine belief that on the whole, most people are good and things are getting better.\n\nListen as Arthur Brooks and economist Emily Oster explore what it means to be the perfect parent and why flexibility can be crucial.\n\nWorking hard to avoid instilling a fear-based primal belief in kids is good. But really, we should all be able to do better than that, and try to cultivate a positive primal belief that can truly improve their lives. For that, I turn to the words of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu. “Through Love, one has no fear,” he wrote in the Tao Te Ching.\n\nRead: Love is medicine for fear\n\nInstead of teaching our kids fear primals, let’s teach them love primals, which neutralize fear and put something good in its place. Let them know that people are made for love—we all crave it, and we can find something lovable in just about everyone we meet. We don’t always give it or accept it, because we make a lot of mistakes, but love is what all our hearts desire. If you want to give your children a rule to live by, this one is a much safer bet.\n\n​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "title": "Americans Are Buying an Escape Plan",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 3:05 pm E.T. on March 22, 2025\n\nEven as Donald Trump advertises his hard-line approach to border crossers, he is actively soliciting one particular group of immigrants: rich ones. In February, Trump proposed that America start offering a U.S. “gold card” for $5 million. “Green-card privileges, plus” is how the president described it: “It’s going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country,” he said. Trump predicted that the United States could sell a million of these cards, enough to eliminate the national debt. Even Russian oligarchs could be eligible, he said—though (thanks to economic sanctions) “they’re not quite as wealthy as they used to be.”\n\nTrump seemed to relish the scheme’s shock value. But these days, buying a visa or passport is not controversial: About half of the world’s nations already offer visas, permanent residence, or even full citizenship for sums ranging from the low five to low seven figures. The U.S. itself grants up to 10,000 residency permits a year under its EB-5 investor visa program, which Congress has approved until 2027 and costs applicants about $1 million.\n\nBut if Trump expects a flood of takers, he has it backwards: The international rich aren’t trying to come here, so much as Americans are trying to get out. U.S. citizens now represent the majority of clients looking for an exit, through foreign citizenship, permanent residence, or a visa that allows them to live abroad.\n\nI have been writing about the world of millionaire migration for years. The market depends on a cottage industry of advisers, financial planners, and lawyers who help their clients navigate the paperwork and requirements, and I spoke with some of these experts in the weeks following Trump’s announcement. All seemed to think that only a handful of people would take Trump’s bait—mainly because there simply aren’t enough people rich enough to shell out $5 million with no return on their investment.\n\nDominic Volek, an executive at the consulting firm Henley & Partners, told me that his clients typically “look at investing 10 percent of their net worth on citizenship or residence.” To consider the gold card, they’d need “a liquid net worth of $50 million, and there are only around 300,000 people globally who have that kind of money.” Even then, gold cards will succeed only “if America’s relaxed about the source of funds,” another lawyer, Sam Bayat, who works with a lot of clients in the Middle East, told me. Shady Russian oligarchs, in other words, might be the target demographic, rather than an edge case.\n\nThe far bigger story is the reverse phenomenon: Thousands of Americans a year are applying to visa programs abroad, primarily in Europe—Portugal in particular—and the Caribbean, where island nations offer citizenship outright, sometimes upon purchase of property. An American doctor or dentist considering a second home in storm-addled Florida might now buy a $325,000 condo in St. Kitts and Nevis instead and, in the bargain, qualify for the island nation’s citizenship in as little as three months. A nature lover might look to Costa Rica, which grants residence (and a fast track to citizenship) for $150,000. Vanuatu will effectively sell you a passport for $130,000; Dominica’s costs $200,000.\n\nAlana Semuels: Should Congress let wealthy foreigners buy green cards?\n\nHistorically, people have looked to buy a different citizenship because they live under undemocratic political systems, or because their passport makes it difficult to travel. (Afghans, for instance, can go to just six countries without a visa; Spaniards can go to 133.) Eric Major, the CEO of the immigration-advising firm Latitude, began his career helping rich Hong Kongers make exit plans to relocate to Canada or the United Kingdom ahead of the territory’s scheduled handover to China. “The smart capital, the top guys in Hong Kong in the 1990s, were all saying, ‘We gotta hedge,’” Major told me, referring to fears that China would crack down on business and political freedoms. Major went on to work mainly with clients from China, Russia, India, and the Middle East.\n\nToday most of Major’s clients are American. Volek’s firm has more clients from America than from the next four biggest feeder countries (Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and the U.K.) combined. Fifteen years ago, the firm did not see much point in opening a U.S. office. This year, it’s launching its tenth. “I never would have imagined my No. 1 source market would become America,” Major told me. “But now the top brass of America is hedging.”\n\nHedging is the operative word: Few of these Americans are actually moving abroad at the moment. It’s about having options, Volek said: “It’s purely the realization that, ‘I’m wealthy and diversified in terms of assets, bonds, and equities, so why on earth would I have one country of citizenship and residence? It makes no sense.’”\n\nThe great American hedge began during the coronavirus pandemic. Overnight, U.S. citizens—even the entitled ultrarich—found themselves barred from entering other countries. “I’m worth $20, $50 million and I have a private jet and a home in Europe, and you’re telling me I can’t enter?” Volek recalls. That wasn’t something Americans “had contemplated before.”\n\nThe emergency passed, and international travel picked back up. But the sense of uncertainty has persisted—compounded by a spate of uniquely American tragedies: school shootings, high-profile displays of systemic racism, and the storming of the Capitol on January 6. Climate events such as hurricanes and wildfires have shaken homeowners, inflation has spooked investors, and the Trump-Biden-Trump whiplash has made politics feel more unpredictable than ever.\n\nNow, as Elon Musk attacks the federal government’s social and regulatory programs, the U.S. is beginning to take on the contours of a nation without a clear future. “It’s the same push factors as other countries,” Major explained. “People don’t trust the government; they’re worried about the quality of the air; they want to educate their kids.”\n\nIt’s hard to exaggerate how meaningful this shift has been for the mobility industry. I’ve been talking to people like Volek and Major since 2012, and I published the first book on the market for passports in 2015. I would always run into the occasional American looking to expatriate, but they tended to be eccentrics, such as a man known as “Bitcoin Jesus” and subscribers to newsletters such as Nomad Capitalist. These Americans weren’t worried about gun violence and political stability. They were hard-core libertarians who wanted to avoid taxes at all costs. Many would go on to renounce their U.S. citizenship after acquiring their foreign one.\n\nAs the people looking to move have changed, so too has the mobility industry, which has far more options now and is far more accessible and socially acceptable. “The overall trend is toward more legitimacy and people realizing it’s totally normal” to pay to emigrate, Kristin Surak, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the author of The Golden Passport, told me.\n\nJonathan Lemire: Elon Musk is president\n\nAmericans without a ton of money are finding ways to access new passports by re-hyphenating themselves. Many are casting around for long-lost relatives through which they can claim Italian, Irish, Austrian, or German citizenship. Tracking down birth certificates from the old country and persuading embassies to accept them as proof of citizenship used to be logistically complicated; now there are consultants to help with that too. European countries have grown accustomed to American applicants who want to expand their options and lower the cost of college, health care, and child care.\n\nAccording to one estimate, about 40 percent of U.S. citizens might be eligible for European passports through their ancestors. Last year, Ireland received 31,825 passport applications from U.S. citizens, Austria naturalized 1,914 (virtually all as reparations for Nazi-era persecutions), and more than 6,100 Americans applied for British citizenship, with a noticeable uptick beginning in November.\n\n“Americans have gotten very pragmatic,” says Audra DeFalco, who specializes in “citizenship by descent” at Latitude. “They’re retirees, people whose grandma was Polish and they really loved their grandma; some want to study abroad without having student loans.”\n\nMore and more, DeFalco says, the Americans with an exit plan are just people who have the time and resources to make one.\n\nWhen I spoke with Charlie, a businessman from the Midwest who is in the process of obtaining a Portuguese “golden visa,” I was struck by what I saw in the background of his video. He wasn’t Zooming from a sterile condo in a glass tower in some anonymous global capital, or a fancy hotel room on his way someplace else. He was sitting in the cozy-looking living room of the suburban house he’d lived in for years.\n\n“We have four kids and two grandsons, who all live very close, and we spend an inordinate amount of time with our family,” Charlie said. “It’s the central focus of our lives.” (He asked to go by a pseudonym in case speaking publicly would interfere with his visa application.)\n\nCharlie’s done well enough as an entrepreneur to afford a pricey Plan B, but he isn’t a jet-setting oligarch or a paranoid crypto bro. He’s a Kamala Harris voter (“obviously”), he’s Jewish (“we go to synagogue on occasion”), and he loves living in America, where he’s part of a tight-knit community. Still, he’s almost at the end of the year-long process to purchase a Portuguese residence permit, which begins with investing about $540,000 in the country.\n\nWhat pushed him to look outside the United States was his growing fear for his safety. Charlie told me that he feels threatened by both the Nazi-saluting right and the Gaza-protesting left. “I have enough knowledge of history to know and to believe that people who say ‘It could never happen here’ are daydreaming,” he said.\n\n(I asked him why he hadn’t simply taken Israeli citizenship, which is available to all Jews, would cost him next to nothing, and was quite literally created for this purpose. “I don’t know that my wife particularly savored the idea of living there,” he said. “It wasn’t in her mind an ideal place.”)\n\nLately, though, his fears have gone way beyond anti-Semitism “to being scared of where our country is going and whether the forces of good will eventually win out over the bullshit that’s tearing down the government,” he said. He sees an escape hatch as common sense, not traitorous. He told me that he’d “even inspired” a few of his friends to look into it.\n\nKrishnadev Calamur: The EU wants to clamp down on the super rich’s visa of choice\n\nMina Hsiao and Chris Carter are a couple nearing retirement age. They recently returned to San Diego after spending most of the past 16 years in Shanghai, but within months, they had applied for a visa to live in Sarawak, on the Malaysian island of Borneo. The permit lasts 10 years and costs about $33,500 a person. Applicants must also have health insurance and be able to financially support themselves.\n\nThe couple had been looking forward to their homecoming, but it quickly became clear that the U.S. they’d left was not the same country that was waiting for them. Hsiao felt unsafe as an Asian woman, particularly when she went out wearing a mask. Carter’s family was divided along political lines. Even their church felt like a minefield. “We were hopeful until November,” Carter recalled. “But after I saw how many people voted for Trump, after the first term, after January 6—and people of faith in the church embracing Christian nationalism …”\n\n“The Christianity that somehow has morphed in this country is not our expression of faith,” Hsiao interjected. “We thought we were coming back to a psychological home, not just the comfort of language but also ideals—security, opportunity for all. And that wasn’t the case.”\n\nHow long do they envision staying abroad? “At least three years, nine months, and two weeks,” Carter joked. “But things will not go back to pre-Trump,” Hsiao added. “That’s our concern.”\n\nKate, who works at a pharmaceutical company in Boston, is establishing European residence through the same visa program as Charlie (and she asked me to use a pseudonym for the same reason). She moved to the United States from Ukraine in 2000 after her family struggled to adjust to post-Soviet turmoil, and got American citizenship soon after.\n\nShe is in her 50s now, and started thinking about relocating a few years ago, when she had some extra cash after downsizing her home. “I thought maybe Cape Cod would be a good investment,” she said, “but then my cousin, a lawyer in Manhattan, said, ‘Don’t do Cape Cod. Buy something in Europe and get a citizenship.”\n\nThen, in January, she saw a message on social media about federal workers being asked “to stay loyal or resign,” Kate told me. She “completely freaked out” and sent it to her family, commenting: “Perestroika in one week.” She’s now in the process of applying for permanent residence in Portugal.\n\n“I have my job in America, so there’s no rush to move,” Kate said. “But I fear civil war.” She told me she felt lucky not to be in Ukraine, “but seeing how polarized America has become—it makes me wonder about the way forward.”\n\nWhether these Americans will really leave remains to be seen. Charlie said his greatest hope is that he won’t have to. But he finds comfort in knowing that he has the option of escape if the worst ever comes to pass, and in the idea that if he does have to go, he won’t be alone. He said he tells his family members: “If it gets so bad that we feel the obligation to leave the country, we believe it’ll be bad enough that they’ll want to go as well.”",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Making America healthy again, it seems, starts with a double cheeseburger and fries. Earlier this month, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited a Steak ’n Shake in Florida and shared a meal with Fox News’s Sean Hannity. The setting was no accident: Kennedy has praised the fast-food chain for switching its cooking oil from seed oil, which he falsely claims causes illness, to beef tallow. “People are raving about these french fries,” Kennedy said after eating one, before commending other restaurants that fry with beef tallow: Popeyes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Outback Steakhouse.\n\nTo put it another way, if you order fries at Steak ’n Shake, cauliflower wings at Buffalo Wild Wings, or the Bloomin’ Onion at Outback, your food will be cooked in cow fat. For more than a decade, cutting down on meat and other animal products has been idealized as a healthier, more ethical way to eat. Guidelines such as “Eat Food. Not Too Much. Mostly Plants” may have disproportionately appealed to liberals in big cities, but the meat backlash has been unavoidable across the United States. The Obama administration passed a law to limit meat in school lunches; more recently, meat alternatives such as Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat have flooded grocery-store shelves, and fast-food giants are even serving them up in burgers and nuggets. It all heralded a future that seemed more tempeh than tomahawk steak: “Could this be the beginning of the end of meat?” wrote The New York Times in 2022.\n\nNow the goal of eating less meat has lost its appeal. A convergence of cultural and nutritional shifts, supercharged by the return of the noted hamburger-lover President Donald Trump, has thrust meat back to the center of the American plate. It’s not just MAGA bros and MAHA moms who resist plant-based eating. A wide swath of the U.S. seems to be sending a clear message: Nobody should feel bad about eating meat.\n\nMany people are relieved to hear it. Despite all of the attention on why people should eat less meat—climate change, health, animal welfare—Americans have kept consuming more and more of it. From 2014 to 2024, annual per capita meat consumption rose by nearly 28 pounds, the equivalent of roughly 100 chicken breasts. One way to make sense of this “meat paradox,” as the ethicist Peter Singer branded it in The Atlantic in 2023, is that there is a misalignment between how people want to eat and the way they actually do. The thought of suffering cows releasing methane bombs into the atmosphere pains me, but I love a medium-rare porterhouse.\n\nRead: The meat paradox\n\nIndeed, lots of people who self-identify as plant-eaters don’t really eat that way, Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, told me. He runs the national Monthly Meat Demand Monitor, which asks survey respondents to self-declare their diets and then report what they ate the day before. “The number that tell me they’re vegan or vegetarian—the true number is about half that,” Tonsor said. In some years, the misalignment is even more glaring: In 2023, 7.9 percent of people who filled out the survey self-declared as vegan or vegetarian, but only 1.8 percent actually ate that way consistently. (The survey is partly funded by the meat industry.)\n\nThat dissonance is a function of how eating less meat has been wrapped in a conscientious and moral sheen. As I wrote last year, labeling items as “plant-based” has become so symbolic of health and goodness that it has been used to sell virtually anything, edible or not. The campaign against meat hasn’t just disappeared, of course. Go to any major grocery store, and you’ll still see plenty of shrink-wrapped Impossible Burgers.\n\nBut of late, the food landscape is starting to resemble a meatopia. Sweetgreen, a chain that rose to prominence by serving salads that appealed to aspirationally plant-based eaters, now runs ads spotlighting its “protein plates” piled with steak, chicken, and salmon. Dried meat sticks—think Slim Jims—are the fastest-growing snack category nationwide. Fast-food chains including McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr. have ditched their alternative-meat options.\n\nRead: Meat trimmings are a health food now\n\nThere are a lot of different reasons for this meat renaissance: America has become obsessed with consuming more protein, a fad boosted by the growing numbers of people on GLP-1 drugs seeking out protein-rich diets. Plant-based meat once seemed to be on a path to becoming a dinner staple, but its popularity is in free fall due to concerns about its cost, taste, and healthfulness.\n\nThe embrace of meat isn’t just about food, but also about what meat represents: tradition, strength, dominance, muscles—values championed by the right. (There’s a reason that “soy boy” is a common pejorative to describe insufficiently masculine liberals.) Conservatives have long sought to turn meat into a front in the culture wars, even suggesting that Democrats “want to take away your hamburgers.” Last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a preemptive ban on the sale of lab-grown meat in his state, describing it as part of “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish, or bugs.”\n\nTrump’s reelection has bolstered the cause. The rise of meat-eating is part of the larger wave of right-wing influence on American culture. “Woke”—DEI, caring about the climate, eating plant-based—is out. Tradition, at least one specific version of it, is in. Last week, The New Yorker announced the “Revenge of the American Steakhouse,” which, to some, signals a “restoration of the proper order.” Efforts on the right to reestablish conventional gender norms create an environment for gendered eating habits to thrive. Men have long eaten more meat than women; half the nation’s beef is consumed by just 12 percent of the population, most of them men. Research shows that men who subscribe to traditional gender norms tend to eat more beef and chicken.\n\nRead: Americans stopped cooking with tallow for a reason\n\nSome of the most vocal support for the meat-forward lifestyle emanates from the so-called manosphere, a right-leaning internet subculture best known for men promoting different ways to become manlier. It is popular among the young men who voted for Trump in large numbers. Meat’s ascendance “coincides with the rise of the masculine influencers,” Timothy Caulfield, a professor at the University of Alberta who studies male health trends, told me. Many of the manosphere’s main characters frame meat-eating as an antidote to the left’s “attack on masculinity,” a recurring right-wing talking point.\n\nTucker Carlson’s documentary The End of Men calls on men to eat organ meat and raw eggs to boost their testosterone levels. (Little scientific evidence exists to support this.) Last year, Elon Musk appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and suggested that the climate impacts of industrial meat are overblown: “You can totally eat as much meat as you want,” he said. Both Musk and Rogan have promoted the all-meat “carnivore diet.” Other influencers encourage more extreme behaviors, such as eating raw beef testicles for a testosterone boost.\n\nAll of this is happening amid confusion about what it even means to eat well. The prevailing view among the medical and scientific community has not changed: Reducing consumption of red and processed meats is better for human and planetary health. But as pro-meat figures such as Kennedy and Trump challenge those views—not to mention the institutions that support them—the problems with meat-eating no longer seem as clear-cut.\n\nRead: The Jordan Peterson all-meat diet\n\nPerhaps the decline of plant-based eating was inevitable. Awareness of meat-eating’s many consequences first entered the public consciousness in the late 2000s, after the release of documentaries such as Food, Inc. and books such as The Omnivore’s Dilemma. But the backlash to meat may have taken off for a different reason, Bill Winders, a sociologist of food at Georgia Tech, told me: The Great Recession made meat more expensive. Nearly two decades later, the idea of a meatless future seems quaint. Knowing the reasons you should eat less meat goes only so far. I feel guilty eating steak tartare, but it’s still my favorite dish. The commonality of this experience can feel like a free pass. As Singer, the ethicist, puts it: “Most people can easily continue doing something they believe is wrong as long as they have plenty of company.” Now no one has to keep up the charade.",

        "title": "The Lesson Snow White Should Teach Disney",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Judging by some of the online comments aimed at Rachel Zegler, the star of Disney’s live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you’d think that she had done something unforgivable—set Cinderella Castle on fire, perhaps, or told Mickey Mouse he couldn’t wish upon a star. But Zegler had merely stated her opinion of the original 1937 film: that she finds it “extremely dated” and that, to her, the prince “literally stalks” Snow White. Her take on the protagonist, she said in interviews, would have more agency, which she believed would befit the expectations of a 21st-century audience.\n\nHer remarks about the film—and her outspokenness in general, including about other, unrelated topics—have provoked furor across a remarkably wide swath of the internet: ardent fans of the earlier Snow White, apologists for the prince, defenders of the dynamics behind fantasy love stories. (Perhaps less unexpectedly, extreme right-wingers have also taken issue with a character named Snow White being played by a Latina actress; Zegler is of Colombian descent.) The film’s trailer drew criticism from viewers too, in keeping with the ongoing disapproval of Disney’s live-action redos.\n\nIt turns out that the backlash is a lot of noise for a movie that makes the bare-minimum effort to adapt its oft-adapted story—and didn’t resonate with theatergoers over its first weekend. (Snow White failed to clear $100 million at the global box office, falling far short of expectations.) The new version of the princess, while maintaining the warmth that has endeared her to generations of viewers, does get a more satisfying and robust journey than the one she undertakes in the classic animated film; she learns to become a confident leader, taking an active role in saving her kingdom from her stepmother, the Evil Queen (played by Gal Gadot). But updating Snow White herself turns out to be one of the only things that makes the new movie, now in theaters, compelling.\n\nMuch like Disney’s prior almost-shot-for-shot live-action remakes—including 2017’s Beauty and the Beast and 2023’s The Little Mermaid—Snow White seems to have been uneasy about how much story to actually rewrite and how live the action can be, given its heavy reliance on digitally rendered imagery. Most of its tweaks, apart from the ones made to Snow White, are superfluous; the film nips and tucks set pieces while padding its nearly two-hour run time with extraneous songs and dialogue. These cursory changes clash with its more modernized lead, and the resulting dissonance is particularly egregious. By stranding Snow White in garish landscapes opposite thinly written scene partners, the movie betrays her, undercutting her message about valuing inner beauty over vanity.\n\nRead: Beauty and the Beast: a tale as old as time, told worse\n\nAt the risk of sounding superficial myself, just look at Snow White’s hair. The style is faithful to her animated look, but the live-action rendition offers an unnecessary explanation for it: In the prologue, a narrator tells us that the Evil Queen made her stepdaughter cut her hair short as a little girl; there’s even a quick shot of said chop. Never mind that the stiff bob doesn’t exactly suit Zegler—it doesn’t match the character’s evolution either, with her coif staying immaculate even after she flees into the woods. More off-putting are the computer-generated dwarves, who are uncannily realistic instead of agreeably cartoonish. They pull off impressively choreographed musical numbers, but there’s no shaking the strangeness of Snow White trading dialogue with such dead-eyed creations. That discordance extends beyond the aesthetic choices: Some of the bouncy, overproduced new songs, from the composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (the Oscar-winning duo who worked on La La Land and also co-wrote original numbers for the Aladdin remake), sound a tad too contemporary, at odds with the repurposed melodies of unassuming classics such as “Whistle While You Work.”\n\nNo wonder the audience at my screening seemed confused throughout most of the film. The dwarves’ slapsticky introduction, with them bumbling and falling over one another in the mines, didn’t elicit laughter; their jarring, waxy appearances made a child behind me yelp in fright. The Evil Queen’s solo tune, which Gadot strains to sing, ends with a big finish that left my theater completely silent—not in awe, but in apathy. Later, an ostensibly inspiring moment featuring one of the dwarves failed to draw the round of applause it seemed intended to encourage. The women next to me descended into a fit of giggles instead, while some people in the crowd gasped, alarmed at the scene’s out-of-nowhere reveal. (I was one of them.)\n\nI like when Disney’s live-action remakes surprise me—I’d just prefer that they do so on purpose. They already tend to be safe bets for the studio, built for younger audiences while attracting adults who grew up with the animated features. But save for a handful of true reimaginings—Tim Burton’s introspective take on Dumbo in 2019, or Niki Caro’s martial-arts-heavy Mulan from 2020, which went underseen largely because of COVID-19 restrictions—the bulk of these endeavors have been copy-and-paste jobs. They’re costly projects that may draw crowds based on name recognition alone, but what if they conjured magic rather than mere nostalgia? Let’s see the Evil Queen be materialistic and not just talk-sing about it. Let’s make the forest actually enchanted and not just the backdrop for cuddly woodland creatures. Let’s try giving Snow White some more of the horror shading the Brothers Grimm gave the fairy tale. The princess already “dies,” after all.\n\nRead: Tim Burton’s Dumbo is a dark interpretation that really soars\n\nBesides, as serviceable as these half-hearted adaptations may be to theatergoers, they tend to waste the talent involved. Gifted composers have to assemble pale imitations of popular musical numbers, accomplished visual-effects artists spend months making facsimiles of scenes that will always look more kinetic in cartoon form, and the actors, especially when they don’t look exactly like their two-dimensional counterparts, are sometimes targeted by outrage-prone corners of the internet. As Disney prepares to roll out more live-action versions of its animated classics—Moana hits theaters next year, and there are adaptations of Robin Hood, The Aristocats, and Bambi in the works—the company could stand to learn from Snow White herself. In the remake’s climax, Zegler’s protagonist urges her kingdom’s people to remember how they lived before the Evil Queen ruled; they once pursued their passions, and used to be courageous. Snow White chooses to be fearless. A studio can too—even if this one so rarely does.",

        "title": "An ‘Impossible’ Disease Outbreak in the Alps",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In March 2009, after a long night on duty at the hospital, Emmeline Lagrange took a deep breath and prepared to place a devastating phone call. Lagrange, a neurologist, had diagnosed a 42-year-old woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The woman lived in a small village in the French Alps, an hour and a half drive away from Lagrange’s office in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital. Because ALS is rare, Lagrange expected that the patient’s general practitioner, Valerie Foucault, had never seen a case before.\n\nSnow fell outside Lagrange’s window as she got ready to describe how ALS inevitably paralyzes and kills its victims. But to her surprise, as soon as she shared the diagnosis, Foucault responded, “I know this disease very well, because she is the fourth in my village.”\n\nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, occurs in roughly two to three people out of every 100,000 in Europe. (The rate is slightly higher in the United States.) But every so often, hot spots emerge. Elevated ALS rates have been observed around a lagoon in France, surrounding a lake in New Hampshire, within a single apartment building in Montreal, and on the eastern—but not western—flank of Italy’s Mount Etna. Such patterns have confounded scientists, who have spent 150 years searching for what causes the disease. Much of the recent research has focused on the genetics of ALS, but clusters provocatively suggest that environmental factors have a leading role. And each new cluster offers scientists a rare chance to clarify what those environmental influences may be—if they can study it fast enough. Many clusters fade away as mysteriously as they once appeared.\n\nAfter the call, Lagrange was uneasy; she had a hunch about how much work lay ahead of her. For the next decade, she and a team of scientists investigated the cluster in the Alps, which eventually grew to include 16 people—a total 10 times higher than the area’s small population should have produced. Even during that first call, when Lagrange knew about only four cases of ALS, she felt dazed by the implications, and by Foucault’s desperate plea for help. If something in the village was behind the disturbing numbers, Foucault had no idea what it was. “She was really upset,” Lagrange remembers. “She said to me, ‘This is impossible; you must stop this.’”\n\nFor some people, the trouble begins in the throat. As their muscles waste, swallowing liquids becomes a strenuous activity. Others may first notice difficulty moving an arm or a leg. “Every day, we see that they lose something,” Foucault said of her patients. “You lose a finger, or you lose your laugh.” Eventually, enough motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord die that people simply cannot breathe. Lou Gehrig died two years after his diagnosis, when he was just 37. Stephen Hawking, an anomaly, lived with ALS until he was 76.\n\nFive to 10 percent of people with ALS have a family member with the disease. In the 2000s, advancements in DNA sequencing led to a swell of genetic research that found that about two-thirds of those familial cases are connected to a handful of genetic mutations. But only one in 10 cases of ALS in which patients have no family history of the disease can be connected to genetic abnormalities. “What we have to then explain is how, in the absence of genetic mutation, you get to the same destination,” Neil Shneider, the director of Columbia’s Eleanor and Lou Gehrig ALS Center, told me.\n\nScientists have come up with several hypotheses for how ALS develops, each more complicated and harder to study than genetics alone. One suggests that ALS is caused by a combination of genetic disposition and environmental exposures throughout a lifetime. Another suggests that the disease develops after one person receives six cumulative “hits,” which can be genetic mutations, exposures to toxins, and perhaps even lifestyle factors such as smoking.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nEmmeline Lagrange stands in her office at Grenoble University Hospital.\n\nEach time a cluster appears, researchers have tried to pin down the exact environmental hazards, professions, and activities that might be linked to it. After World War II, a neurodegenerative disease that looked just like ALS—though some patients also showed features of Parkinson’s and dementia—surged in Guam, predominantly among the native Chamorro people. “Imagine walking into a village where 25 percent of the people are dying from ALS,” says Paul Alan Cox, an ethnobotanist who studied the outbreak. “It was like an Agatha Christie novel: Who’s the murderer?”\n\nEarly research tried to pin the deaths on an unlikely culprit: the highly toxic cycad plant and its seeds, which locals ground into flour to make tortillas. Cox and his colleagues hypothesize that human cells mistake a compound called BMAA found in the plant for another amino acid, leading to misfolded proteins in the brain. Peter Spencer, an environmental neuroscientist at Oregon Health & Science University, has argued for a different explanation: The body converts cycasin, a compound also found in the plant’s seeds, into a toxic chemical that can cause DNA damage and, eventually, neurodegeneration. Each theory faced its own criticism, and a consensus was never reached—except for perhaps an overarching tacit agreement that the environment was somehow integral to the story. By the end of the 20th century, the Guam cluster had all but vanished.\n\nGenetic mutations are precise; the world is messy. This is partly why ALS research still focuses on genes, Evelyn Talbott, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told me. It’s also why clusters, muddled as they might be, are so valuable: They give scientists the chance to find what’s lurking in the mess.\n\nMontchavin was a mining town until 1886, when the mine closed, leaving the village largely deserted. In 1973, it was connected to a larger network of winter-tourism destinations in the Alps. On a sunny December afternoon, the week before ski season officially began, I met Foucault outside of the church in the center of Bellentre, a town of 900 whose borders include Montchavin and neighboring villages. The mountains loomed over us, not yet capped with much snow, as she greeted me in a puffer coat. She led me briskly up a steep hill, chatting in a mix of French and English, until we arrived at her home, which she occasionally uses as an office to see patients.\n\nFoucault made us a pot of black tea, then set down a notepad of scrawled diagnoses and death dates on the table beside her. The first person Foucault knew with ALS lived a stone’s throw from where we were sitting, in a house down the hill; he had been diagnosed in 1991. The second case was a ski instructor, Daniel, who lived in Montchavin and had a chalet near Les Coches, a ski village five minutes up a switchback road by car. Daniel, whose family requested that I use only his first name for medical privacy, had told Foucault in 2000 that he was having trouble speaking, so she’d sent him to a larynx specialist. When the specialist found nothing wrong with his throat, Daniel was referred to a neurologist in Grenoble, who diagnosed him with ALS.\n\nIn 2005, after Foucault heard that the husband of one of her general-medicine patients had been diagnosed with ALS, she called her father, a heart doctor in Normandy. “It’s not normal,” he told her. A few years later, she saw one of her patients, the 42-year-old woman, in the village center with her arm hanging limp from her body. Even before the woman received her ALS diagnosis from Lagrange, Foucault suspected the worst.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nValerie Foucault stands in her backyard in Bellentre.\n\nAfter her call with Foucault, Lagrange assembled a team of neurologists and collaborators from the French government to search for an environmental spark that might have set off the cluster in Montchavin. They tested for heavy metals in the drinking water, toxins in the soil, and pollutants in the air. When the village was turned into a ski destination in the 1970s, builders had repurposed wood from old train cars to build garden beds—so the team checked the environment for creosote, a chemical used in the manufacture of those train cars. They screened for compounds from an artificial snow used in the ’80s. They checked gardens, wells, and even the brain of one deceased ALS patient. Years passed, and nothing significant was found.\n\nThe day after I had tea with Foucault, I visited Lagrange at the hospital. Her voice faltered as she ruffled through the piles of papers from their investigation on her desk. She’d cared for most of Montchavin’s ALS patients from their diagnosis to death. She worked in Montchavin on the weekends and took her family vacations there. “I felt responsible for them,” she said. “People were telling me, This is genetic. They all live together; they must be cousins. I knew it was not so.” Lagrange’s team had tested the genomes of 12 people in the Montchavin cluster, and none had mutations that were associated with ALS. Nor did any of the patients have parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents with ALS.\n\nBut their lives did overlap in other meaningful ways. The first Montchavin cases worked together as ski instructors and had chalets in a wooded patch of land called L’Orgère, up the mountain. Many of them hiked together; others simply enjoyed spending time in nature. “We thought they must have something in common, something that they would eat or drink,” Lagrange told me, sitting in her desk chair in a white lab coat and thick brown-framed glasses. She handed me a daunting packet: a questionnaire she’d developed for the ALS patients, their families, and hundreds of people without the disease who lived in the area. The survey, which took about three hours to complete, asked about lifestyle, eating habits, hobbies, jobs, everywhere they had lived, and more. It revealed that the ALS patients consistently ate three foods that the controls didn’t: game, dandelion greens, and wild mushrooms.\n\nLagrange’s team didn’t immediately suspect the mushrooms. But Spencer, the environmental neuroscientist in Oregon, did after he saw one of Lagrange’s colleagues present on the Montchavin cluster at a 2017 conference. Having researched the role of the cycad seed in the Guam cluster, Spencer knew that some mushrooms contain toxins that can powerfully affect the nervous system.\n\nSpencer joined the research group, and in 2018, he accompanied Lagrange to Montchavin to distribute more surveys and conduct in-person interviews about the victims’ and other locals’ diets— the pair had particular interest in people’s mushroom consumption. From the responses, the team learned that the ALS patients were not the only mushroom foragers in town, but they shared an affinity for a particular species that local interviewees without ALS said they never touched: the false morel.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nThe streets of Montchavin are quiet before ski season begins.\n\nA false morel looks like a brain that has been left out in the sun. Its cap is a shriveled mass of brown folds, darker than the caramel hue of the true morel. One species, Gyromitra esculenta, grew around Montchavin and was especially abundant near the ski chalets in spring if enough snow had fallen the preceding winter. France has a rich foraging culture, and the false morel was just one of many species mushroom enthusiasts in Montchavin might pick up to sauté with butter and herbs. The false morel contains gyromitrin, a toxin that sickens some number of foragers around the world every year; half of the ALS victims in Montchavin reported a time when they had acute mushroom poisoning. And according to Spencer, the human body may also metabolize gyromitrin into a compound that, over time, might lead to similar DNA damage as cycad seeds.\n\nNo one can yet say that the false morel caused ALS in Montchavin; Lagrange plans to test the mushroom or its toxin in animal models to help establish whether it leads to neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, Spencer feels that the connection between Montchavin and Guam is profound—that the cluster in the Alps is another indication that environmental triggers can be strongly associated with neurodegenerative disease.\n\nOnce you start looking, the sheer variety of potential environmental catalysts for ALS becomes overwhelming: pesticides, heavy metals, air pollution, bodies of water with cyanobacteria blooms. Military service is associated with higher ALS risk, as is being a professional football player, a painter, a farmer, or a mechanic. Because of how wide-ranging these findings are, some researchers doubt the utility of environmental research for people with ALS. Maybe the causes are too varied to add up to a meaningful story about ALS, and each leads to clusters in a different way. Or perhaps, Jeffrey Rothstein, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine neurologist, told me, a cluster means nothing; it’s simply a rare statistical aberration. “Patients are always looking for some reason why they have such a terrible disease,” he said. “There’s been plenty of blips like this over time in ALS, and each one has its own little thought of what’s causing it, and they’ve all gone nowhere.”\n\n“A lot of people look askew to the idea that there are clusters,” Eva Feldman, a neurologist at the University of Michigan, told me. But she sees evidence of clusters all the time in her practice. Once, she saw three women with ALS who’d grown up within blocks of one another in the Grand Rapids area. Her research has shown an association between ALS and organic pollutants, particularly pesticides. Feldman thinks that the importance and scope of environmental triggers for ALS can be pinpointed only by investigating clusters more thoroughly. To start, she told me, doctors should be required to disclose every case of ALS to state officials. Feldman is also planning what she says is the first-ever prospective study on ALS in the U.S., following 4,000 healthy production workers in Michigan. She believes that clusters have significance and that because doctors can’t do much to stop ALS once it starts, “we would be naive to throw out any new ideas” about how to prevent it from occurring in the first place.\n\nEven for the people whose lives were upended by the Montchavin cluster, the idea that mushrooms could be linked to such suffering can be difficult to accept. Those who ate them knew the mushrooms could cause unpleasant side effects, but they believed that cooking them removed most of the danger. When I asked Claude Houbart, whose father, Gilles, died in 2019, about his mushroom habits, she called her mother and put her on speakerphone. Claude’s mother said she knew Gilles ate false morels, but she never cooked them for herself or the family—simply because she didn’t want to risk upset stomachs.\n\nDaniel, Foucault’s second ALS patient, also kept his foraging hobby out of the home. He never ate false morels in front of his wife, Brigitte, though she knew he picked wild mushrooms with friends. “I am a bit reluctant when it comes to mushrooms; I would have never cooked them,” Brigitte told me, sitting at her kitchen table in Montchavin, surrounded by photos of Daniel and their now-adult children. After Daniel died in 2008, Brigitte and her family spread his ashes in the woods where he’d spent so much of his time. “He didn’t want a tomb like everyone else,” she said. “When we walk in the forest, we think about him.”\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nBrigitte sits in her home in Montchavin.\n\nHervé Fino, a retired vacation-company manager who has lived in the Alps for 41 years, learned to forage in Montchavin. Bundled in a plaid overcoat inside a wood-paneled rental chalet, Fino recalled local foragers telling him that false morels were edible as long as they were well cooked, but he never ate the mushrooms himself, fearing their digestive effects. Fino told me about one of his friends who regularly gathered false morels, and once made himself a false-morel omelet when his wife was out of town. “He was sick for two days, very ill,” Fino said. Later, that same friend was diagnosed with ALS. He died by suicide.\n\nIn a gruff voice, Fino speculated about what besides the mushroom might have caused the disease. His friend fell into an icy-cold brook two days before he was diagnosed—“Perhaps the shock triggered the disease?” Another woman owned a failing restaurant next to the cable car—maybe the stress had something to do with it. He shrugged his shoulders. Those events didn’t seem right either, not momentous enough to so dramatically alter someone’s fate. Maybe no single explanation ever will. Claude told me she understands why people are skeptical. “Eating a mushroom and then dying in that way?” she said. “Come on.”\n\nBefore leaving Montchavin, I walked through L’Orgère, the area where the first ALS patients had their ski cabins. The windows were dark, and below, the village of Montchavin was mostly empty before the tourist season began. Clumps of snow started to fall, hopefully enough to satisfy the skiers. Recent winters in the French Alps have been warm and dry—not the right conditions for false morels. “There are no more Gyromitra in Montchavin,” Lagrange said. In her view, Montchavin has joined the ranks of ALS clusters come and gone; no one has been diagnosed there since 2019, and it’s been longer since Lagrange’s team has turned up a fresh false-morel specimen.\n\nEven so, on my walk, I couldn’t help but scan for mushrooms, nor could I shake the feeling that my surroundings were not as benign as I’d once believed. Fino said he still keeps an eye out for false morels too. He would never pluck them from the ground to bring home, and yet, he hasn’t stopped looking. One day in 2023, after he parked his car near a ski lift, his gaze caught on a lumpy spot near his feet. Two dark-brown mushrooms stuck out of the damp soil.",

        "content": "In Ursula Le Guin’s novel The Lathe of Heaven, George Orr wakes to discover that he has the power to control reality through his dreams. Each night while he sleeps, the world changes in profound and unexpected ways. In the morning, Orr alone remembers reality as it was. Soon, Orr (named, one would assume, for George Orwell) finds himself under the care of a psychiatrist, who, realizing that Orr has these powers, tries to use them to turn the world into a utopia. This does not go well for the world.\n\nIt doesn’t go well because dreams have their own logic. They are nonlinear and to some degree nonsensical, and so directing oneself to dream of world peace may result in an alien invasion. Technically the dream has been fulfilled. Earthlings have stopped fighting with one another, but only because all of Earth is now ruled by an alien species. In this new dream reality, a world ruled by aliens becomes the only world you have ever known.\n\nThat is what the American experience is beginning to feel like in 2025: Not as if we are living in President Donald Trump’s reality, but as if we are living in his dream. As the showrunner and director of TV shows including Fargo, Legion, and the upcoming Alien: Earth, I think a lot about how audiences navigate the tension between horror and the absurd. Now we’re all in this liminal space of the president’s devising.\n\nDerek Thompson: The political fight of the century\n\nWhen the Trump administration pretends that the three branches of government are not and never have been equal, it creates a state of unreality in the minds of everyday Americans, similar to that of a dreamer in a dream. When the president and his proxies ignore both laws passed by Congress and Supreme Court decisions, they seek to replace the vérité of our shared history and experience with a fantasy, turning the stabilizing force of precedent into the quicksand of dream.\n\nOnly in a dream could the bicycle you’re riding become a pony. But if you tell the pony in the dream that he used to be a bicycle, he will deny it. I’ve always been a pony, he will say. And because this is a dream, you will accept that. But what if you’re awake and your government is doing things and saying things that seem nonsensical? What are you supposed to think when you search for the Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps and discover that it no longer exists? What happens if, as a next step, the history books are revised to erase all records of the name? In this new reality, that body of water has only ever been called the “Gulf of America.” You can imagine the argument that will happen years from now, where you swear there was once a Gulf of Mexico, but, for the life of you, you just can’t prove it.\n\nOver the past two months, the rule of law in this country has been replaced by the rule of whim. The whim is not just that of one man but of a loose cabal of Cabinet members and “special advisers” who are combining revenge fantasies with small-government dreams, xenophobic visions, and cryptocurrency delusions. And so former national-security officials have had their security clearances revoked, government agencies have been fed into the wood chipper, “alien enemies” have been deported despite a judge’s court order, and a vaccine denier and pseudoscience champion has been confirmed as the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe only thing these dreamers have in common is that they want to control reality itself, to rewrite the past, present, and future simultaneously. Their actions create a maelstrom of daily news and revisionist history that the mind struggles to combine into a coherent reality. As a result, we are moving from a waking state to a dream state, where logic is flexible and anything can happen.\n\nThe movie Inception introduced us to a world in which corporate spies infiltrate the dreams of CEOs. Once inside, they steal secrets or, in the central action of the film, seek to implant an idea that the dreamer will, upon waking, turn into a reality. Inception, as they call this process, is considered almost impossible because of how difficult it is to make someone believe that an outside idea is their own. In this framework, however, the logic of the waking world is distinctly different from that of the dream. It assumes a waking world in which things make sense. Where facts have meaning. Not a world whose richest man brandishes a chain saw onstage and hires teenagers nicknamed “Big Balls” to gut the federal government, while the president of the United States reposts an AI video of the Gaza Strip as a luxury resort destination.\n\nInception did not envision a world in which only dream logic exists even when the dreamer is awake; a world where the federal government is trying to both shut down the Department of Education and weaponize it in order to remake how and what children in this country are taught. A world in which the president signs an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act against immigrants from Venezuela, even though the country is not at war with Venezuela. In the administration’s dream logic, the executive order itself creates a preexisting state of war, allowing it to issue the order. The logic is circular. Without being at war, the administration cannot use the act to justify the deportations. Or whatever. The bicycle is a pony. The logic is dream logic.\n\nRead: Trump is breaking the fourth wall\n\nIn the past century, authors in Russia, China, and other countries with totalitarian regimes have written about how absurd life becomes under autocracy. But until you experience it yourself, you can’t fully comprehend the illogic of it—or, I should say, the dream logic of it. It is a feeling as much as an idea, a surreal sense of unreality, from which the dreamer wills himself to wake up.\n\nAs the Austrian-born psychologist Bruno Bettelheim wrote about life under fascism: “Thus has tyranny robbed men of their sleep and pursued them even in their dreams.”\n\nIn this warped reality, rather than dreading sleep, we begin to dread waking up, because every day there is a new dream, one that, like George Orr’s, threatens to fracture our reality yet again. Our job over the next four years is to remember what life was like before the dream so that one day we can make the world a logical place again.",

        "content": "In 1962, the CIA had a driver’s license made for one of its officers, James P. O’Connell. It gave him an alias: James Paul Olds. We know this because the document containing the information was released to the public in 2017—part of an effort to declassify information related to John F. Kennedy’s assassination. But now, thanks to an executive order from President Donald Trump calling for the release of all the classified information pertaining to the incident, we know a bit more. It was, specifically, a California driver’s license.\n\nThis is an irrelevant detail in an irrelevant document. As far as anyone knows, O’Connell had nothing to do with the assassination; the inclusion of his story was probably just a by-product of an overly broad records request. But there it was on Tuesday evening, when the National Archives and Record Administration uploaded to its website about 63,400 pages of “JFK Assassination Records.” Given Trump’s order, the release of all this information sounded dramatic, but much of what has been revealed is about as interesting as that driver’s-license detail. Many of these documents were already public with minor redactions, and many of them have almost nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination and never did. This is why the Assassination Records Review Board, which processed them in the 1990s, labeled so many of them “Not Believed Relevant.”\n\nHundreds of thousands of such documents have been released since the ’90s, including thousands released during Trump’s first term and the Biden administration. (This is thanks to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which was passed in response to overwhelming public interest in the case after the release of the Oliver Stone movie JFK.) But one of Trump’s 2024 campaign promises was to release all the rest; he said that it was “time for the American people to know the TRUTH!” His health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—John Kennedy’s nephew—has been animated about the issue and framed the secrecy around the last files as evidence to support his conspiratorial view of history.\n\nRead: RFK Jr. won. Now what?\n\nThere are still some documents that the Archives could not make public, because they are subject to IRS privacy laws or because they come from sealed grand-jury proceedings. These may come out eventually, but they will likely follow the same drip, drip, drip as all the rest. It seems possible that the public’s curiosity will never be fully satisfied, at least in my lifetime. A new batch will always come out, but there will always be something left.\n\nI’m one of the people who cares a lot about the Kennedy assassination. I’m currently finishing a book about the case. On principle, and out of selfish personal interest, I agree that the government should make all of the documents public if it can. Of course I scanned this new batch to see whether there was anything exciting. There wasn’t, but some of it was kind of funny.\n\nIn many cases, the removed redactions reveal proper nouns that a reader could have easily inferred before or that seem totally inconsequential. For instance, there is a 1974 memo about the Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt’s history with the CIA. A previously released version of the document mentions that the Office of Finance had asked a CIA station whether Hunt had received payments from it while he was living in Madrid. We did not know which station had been asked. Now we know it was the Madrid station. (Wow!) A 1977 document about the New York Times reporter Tad Szulc includes a rumor about Szulc being a Communist; in previous versions of the document, this information was “apparently from a [REDACTED] source.” With the redaction removed, we now know that it was “apparently from a British source.”\n\nSome of it was less funny. The files also contain the unredacted personal information—including Social Security numbers—of dozens of people, seemingly published accidentally, though the National Archives site now suggests this was an inevitable result of the transparency effort. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the problem to The New York Times on Thursday, saying, “At the request of the White House, the National Archives and the Social Security Administration immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.” The National Archives did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nIn my scan, I came across the late-’70s personnel files of dozens of staff members of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, all of which contained Social Security numbers. A good number of those people are likely still alive. The document dump contains the Social Security number of a journalist who was active in the anti-war movement during the ’60s. There are, by my count, 19 documents about his personal life and employment history; none of the documents about him appears to have the faintest relevance to the assassination. Bizarrely, the new release also contains an unredacted arrest record for a Dealey Plaza witness who testified in front of the Warren Commission in 1964. This record—for the alleged theft of a car in 1970—has nothing whatsoever to do with the assassination of President Kennedy. Yet it is reproduced in full and it includes the man’s Social Security number and a full set of his fingerprints.\n\nFrom the February 1964 issue: A eulogy for John F. Kennedy\n\nRelatively few of the documents even mention Kennedy. I saw only one addressed to him: a June 30, 1961, memo from his special assistant, confidant, and eventual biographer, Arthur Schlesinger about the growing power of the CIA. Most of it has been public since 2018, but the version released on Tuesday removed a final redaction about the agency’s extensive use of State Department jobs as cover for its agents. Schlesinger informed Kennedy that about 1,500 CIA agents abroad had State-provided cover stories at the time—too many, in his opinion; he wrote that “the effect is to further the CIA encroachment on the traditional functions of State.” The Paris embassy had 128 CIA people in it at the time, he added as an example. “CIA occupies the top floor of the Paris Embassy, a fact well known locally; and on the night of the Generals’ revolt in Algeria, passersby noted with amusement that the top floor was ablaze with lights.” Again, this is at best “kind of interesting” and at most trivia. It doesn’t meaningfully affect the historical understanding of President Kennedy’s tense relationship with the CIA, which is very well documented elsewhere.\n\nAfter decades of releases, it may be that these are the only kinds of secrets the Archives still hold about the Kennedy assassination—tiny bits of color on things that are already well understood and boring details about people whose connections to the event are minimal if they even exist. But there’s no way to know until we see everything … if we see everything, if we ever can. Even then, when the count of secret things ticks down to zero, how will we know that was really, really all? We won’t, of course. We never will.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nAcross 11 different democracies, politicians share a shockingly pessimistic view: They believe that their voters are uninformed, unreasonable, and short-sighted. In a paper recently published by the American Political Science Review, the University of Calgary political scientist Jack Lucas and his co-authors surveyed 12,000 citizens and conducted face-to-face interviews with nearly 1,000 elected officials. In this wide-ranging study of countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, and Canada, the researchers find that elected officials and voters diverge wildly. Unlike politicians, voters believe themselves to be policy-oriented, politically knowledgeable, and engaged.\n\nOn today’s episode of Good on Paper, I speak with Lucas about how this research reveals a striking divide between democratically elected officials and the voters who put them into office. Even in countries with extremely varied political systems and demographics, this difference persists, suggesting that something fundamental to democracies—at least modern ones—is creating this division. Tellingly, Lucas’s research shows that senior politicians tend to be more cynical about voters than junior ones, suggesting that expecting the worst from voters doesn’t carry an electoral penalty.\n\nDespite this, Lucas is an optimist:\n\n“I’m more on the ‘voters aren’t that dumb’ side of the spectrum,” Lucas tells me, acknowledging that this puts him in the minority among political scientists. “There is pretty good evidence that at least on issues that voters care a lot about, they’re thinking carefully about policy.”\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: When Donald Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he was ostensibly making a joke about the loyalty of his followers. But another way to read it is that it is a revealing comment on how he thinks about voter psychology—that they care little about personal virtue and are with him for his other qualities.\n\nDeciphering voter psychology can feel like an insurmountable exercise. If you talk to individual people about why they voted for their chosen candidate, their answers range from reasonable to incomprehensible.\n\nIn a new paper, the University of Calgary political scientist Jack Lucas and his co-authors investigate this through survey evidence. Their interests lie in both how voters see themselves and, crucially, how politicians see their voters.\n\nIn face-to-face interviews with almost a thousand elected politicians across 11 countries, as well as survey data from over 12,000 citizens, the paper seeks to map how voters think across several key dimensions. Unfortunately, none of that data includes the United States, for reasons we’ll get into, but it’s still relevant to understanding the American electorate.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: The paper seeks to understand whether voters vote based on policy or identity. Are they short-term or long-term oriented? Do they tend to be single-issue or multi-issue voters? Are they pocketbook oriented, or do they vote based on their perception of the national economy? Do they make decisions based on past performance and behavior, or on what they expect to see happen?\n\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. To tease out what we know about these questions, I asked Jack to come on the show and give me a better sense of voter psychology.\n\nJack, welcome to the show.\n\nJack Lucas: Thank you. Thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: So a recurring question on this show, and unfortunately in real life, is: Are voters dumb?\n\nWhat’s your take? Are voters dumb?\n\nLucas: Well, this is the age-old debate in theories of voting behavior. There are a number of competing theories, as you know, and one of the things we’re looking into in this paper is to try and understand where politicians stand on this question. But if you ask me where I stand on this question, I guess I’m more on the “voters aren’t that dumb” side of the spectrum.\n\nDemsas: It’s a bold claim to make right now. (Laughs.)\n\nLucas: Yes, I know. (Laughs.) It’s tough times for those of us who believe policy voting is a thing.\n\nBut I think that arguments that come out of the democratic realist kind of tradition and the work of Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their book, Democracy for Realists, really poses an important challenge to any theories of policy voting that we have to grapple with, and there’s a lot in there that’s, I think, quite persuasive.\n\nBut I also think that when we look at the wider picture of examples, where we can really tease apart whether people are voting on the basis of policy versus whether they’re voting on the basis of things like social identity or irrational retrospection, there is pretty good evidence that, at least on issues that voters care a lot about, they’re thinking carefully about policy.\n\nSo I don’t want to go all the way down the road to say, you know, I’m hard-core spatial voting, and nothing else ever. But there’s, I think, some pretty good evidence to suggest that voters aren’t perhaps as dumb as they seem, if the only thing you look at is the, kind of, democratic-realist theory of voting and voting behavior.\n\nDemsas: And can you define “spatial voting” for us?\n\nLucas: Yes, absolutely. We’re right, straight into the jargon. I apologize.\n\nDemsas: No, you’re good.\n\nLucas: The idea of spatial voting is that all of us carry around in our heads a bundle of policy preferences. You can summarize that bundle of policy preferences with something called an “ideal point,” but this is really just kind of where you live on the left–right spectrum.\n\nAnd when you vote in an election, spatial voting theory suggests that you look around at the candidates or the parties; you identify the one who is closest, whose policy promises are closest to your own ideal point, your preferred bundle of policies; and you support that candidate or party. That’s sort of the basic logic of spatial voting. And it’s prospective, so people are looking forward at the candidates’ and the parties’ policy commitments, and they’re voting on that basis of future promises. And it’s policy oriented because you’re not voting on the basis of how well things are going in your life or your social identity or any other kinds of things like that. You’re really voting on the basis of your policy preferences. So that’s sort of the theoretical arguments at the heart of spatial voting.\n\nDemsas: So you’ve sort of alluded to this, but there’s a variety of axes on which you could be more of, like, a democratic optimist versus a democratic realist. Though, in my head, maybe realists, I would classify them as pessimists. And there’s whether you’re looking forward (you’re prospective) or you’re looking backwards (you’re retrospective). Are you actually voting on a specific issue, like a single-issue voter? Are you a multi-issue voter? There’s just, like, lots of different ways that you can evaluate whether you’re kind of fitting into one of these two camps.\n\nYou’re kind of an outlier, I would say, in political science. Maybe I’m wrong here, but I feel like most political scientists are more on the realist, pessimist side. Or am I reading that wrong?\n\nLucas: No, I think that’s probably right. I mean, all of the debates that we’re exploring in this paper, we selected because they are genuine debates in political science. So you can find examples—and I’m not talking about obscure arguments that nobody ever looks at—but serious, well-cited arguments on both sides of all of these debates.\n\nSo there’s certainly active debates in political science on all of these dimensions. But I think you’re right that, at the moment, you know, we haven’t done a survey of political scientists, so we’ve always talked about how we should, so that we can actually—\n\nDemsas: Oh, yeah. That’d be great.\n\nLucas: —tell people what proportion of political scientists hold these different theoretical positions. I think that my guess is that, as with everything, most people are kind of in the center. And so what you’re going to see if you talk to political scientists is varying degrees of acceptance of the core tenets of democratic realism or spatial voting or whatever.\n\nBut a lot of people will say, as I do, this slightly more hedging kind of argument that there are circumstances in which we would expect to see policy voting matter a lot. And there are a lot of circumstances where voters don’t have sufficient information on candidates, or the election issues aren’t especially salient, or whatever might be happening in that particular election, where people are just gonna fall back on social identities, partisan identities, ingrained rational or irrational retrospection about the past. So you’re going to see different examples of this depending on the election.\n\nSo part of the debate after Achen and Bartels’s book, Democracy for Realists, has been—I think much of the debate has been—not so much about, like, Let’s show that they’re completely wrong, but Let’s try to understand the conditions under which the kinds of phenomena they observe in that book happen, and how common are these things?\n\nAnd so, you know, Anthony Fowler, for example, has a paper where he uses some experimental designs to try to understand how often we would expect people to just vote with their party, regardless of the party’s policy commitments. And he finds it’s, like, maybe a little less than a third of the time. And that’s not nothing. I mean, that’s an enormous proportion.\n\nDemsas: Wait—how does he identify that? How does that paper go?\n\nLucas: It’s based on a conjoint experiment, and the conjoint experiment adds additional policy items. So you know the candidates’ parties. The way these conjoints work is you get two hypothetical candidates, and you’re asked, basically, which one you prefer.\n\nAnd so not only does the partisanship of the candidates vary, but the policy commitments of the candidates also varies, and the number of policy commitments varies. So what he shows is that as you add more policy information to the experiment, people are less likely to just vote straight party selection.\n\nAnd also, as you add more kind of counterintuitive policy commitments on the part of the candidate—like, you have a Republican who is, I don’t know, supportive of income-tax increases on the rich or something—that in those circumstances, you also see that people move away from those candidates. So they’re incorporating the policy information when they can, and about, I think, 29 or 30 percent in that study of the respondents just stick with the party candidate regardless of the policy commitments of the candidate.\n\nSo, you know, that’s a large number. The conclusion I draw from that is definitely not Okay, well, Achen and Bartels’s Democracy for Realists is wrong. But it’s also informative to try and understand, like, how often would it be the case that people would just vote for a partisan candidate, even if that partisan candidate doesn’t share some of their core policy commitments?\n\nAnd obviously, most of the time, these things are observationally equivalent. The Republican candidate is also more conservative on policy, and so it’s really hard to disentangle what is driving the choice of the voter to select that candidate. But there are these cases, both experimentally and also just some weird events that happen in the course of history, where you can try and disentangle that. And when you do, you see that there is some evidence to suggest that voters are able to incorporate their policy commitments into their voting.\n\nBut to come back around to your original question: Yes, I think if I were to preregister a hypothesis on this, my guess is that the democratic realists are the majority among political scientists who do voting behavior right now.\n\nDemsas: Turning to your paper, you’re interested in evaluating two things: one, how voters see themselves, and secondly, how politicians see voters. To this end, you designed a pretty massive survey. Can you walk me through what you and your co-authors did? What was the survey? Who did you talk to?\n\nLucas: Sure. So we wanted to understand on all of these debates that we’ve been talking about where politicians and members of the general public stand, rather than political scientists. So we have theories—political scientists have theories—about voters and voting behavior, and we spend much of our career arguing with each other about those theories. But especially when you watch politicians do their work, or you listen to what they say in speeches, or you even just pay attention to what they say in their memoirs about elections, they, too, seem to have theories of how voters behave and how elections work. And so we wanted to try and measure those among politicians and then also measure them among citizens to have some point of comparison for the politician’s theory.\n\nSo what we did was we wrote up eight questions that we hope capture eight of the more important theoretical debates in voting behavior, without kind of technical language or jargon or anything like that, and we just asked politicians and the members of the general public in 11 countries where they position themselves on each of those debates.\n\nSo we end up with data from just short of a thousand politicians, as well as data from about 12,000 citizens in the same country. So we can compare the citizens and the politicians within countries. And this is all part of a project that’s led by Stefaan Walgrave at the University of Antwerp called POLPOP, which stands for Politicians and Public Opinion.\n\nDemsas: And what kinds of politicians are we talking about here? I mean, I know these are very different systems. You’re looking at Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland. These are very different political systems. But are these, like, local? Are these federal? I mean, what kind of mix are you looking for?\n\nLucas: In this POLPOP project, it’s all national and regional politicians. So these are politicians who are in the central legislature in their country, as well as in some cases, some federal countries like Germany or Canada, where we have really important subnational systems, and we interview provincial or state politicians as well.\n\nSo these are kind of top-level politicians, if you think about the ladder of ambition in politics. We’ve done earlier studies with local politicians, but there are no local politicians in this study.\n\nDemsas: As you said, the questions are pretty straightforward. Like, for example, you just ask straight out, “Some say that voters are impatient and think about the short term when they vote. Others say that voters tend to focus on the long term. Where would you position yourself in this debate?” Zero to 10, with zero being short-term.\n\nIt’s very, very clear to the politician or the voter—you know, the general public that you’re surveying—what you are actually asking them to do. Why did you choose to have this kind of straightforward question versus, like, a question that could get at this answer, perhaps, by asking like, “Would you prefer a candidate whose policies you think would create long-term economic growth or one who would help address immediate cost-of-living concerns?” What was the benefit of the former?\n\nLucas: I think that you’re already onto the basic idea here, which is we just wanted it to be maximally clear. These are, in some cases, sort of complicated social-science debates, and we wanted to say, here, Look—there’s two poles in this particular debate. Here’s one pole; here’s the other. Where would you position yourself in that debate? So there are a number of ways to think about measuring this. And we’re thinking about ways to try and do some of those measures in the future. But because this was the first time that anyone had set out to measure these things among politicians in the kind of way that we do, we wanted to be able to make a clear case about what it was that we were measuring.\n\nAnd so asking sort of straightforward questions, having people position themselves in those debates seemed to us the best way to get started with this sort of work. And this, Some say X; others say Y. Where would you position yourself? is a really common structure for survey questions, and so that was something we thought would feel familiar to the people who are responding, which might also help with some understanding and clarity in the responses.\n\nDemsas: Cool. So let’s get to the findings. What do politicians think of voters, and what do voters think of themselves?\n\nLucas: So politicians, we say, are democratic realists. That is, they tend to subscribe to theories of voting behavior in which voters are not particularly well informed. They focus on short-term considerations. They focus on single issues rather than many issues. They blame politicians for things that are outside the politicians’ control. All of the sort of key ingredients of that book, Democracy for Realists, seem to be reflected in many politicians’ views.\n\nAnd we find that three-quarters of politicians across all of our countries fall into that theoretical type. And that contrasts very starkly with the members of the general public, who are much more evenly divided between the democratic realists and the other group, which we call “democratic optimists.” And these are a much more optimistic theory of a policy-oriented, well-informed, long-term-focused kinds of voters.\n\nDemsas: I thought this was really interesting. Most variation that you find is within country rather than cross-country, which is not something I expected. So essentially, it’s just in two of 22 cases that the country someone is from explains more than 10 percent of the variation in their position. To make that maybe even more clear: In the rest, 90 percent of the variation had nothing to do with whether you were Canadian or Portuguese or whatever. Does that surprise you?\n\nLucas: Yes, absolutely it does. I think it’s really remarkable that in countries as diverse as the ones we’re studying—some have proportional-representation systems, some have single-member plurality systems, some have compulsory voting, and some have mandatory—I mean, it’s just really diverse party systems and institutions. And we see really similar patterns among both the politicians and the comparison between the politicians and the general public across all of these countries. And yes, that was a surprise.\n\nDemsas: But there were two cases where it did explain more than 10 percent of the variation. What were those countries, and what happened there?\n\nLucas: The two areas where we do see meaningful cross-country variation are the question about whether voters focus on a party’s policy commitments or on the leader’s characteristics and competence—the characteristics of the party leader. And we see there is some cross-country variation on that one for sure. It does make sense because some electoral systems and party systems create more personalized politics than other systems. And so we do see that’s reflected in the results.\n\nAnd the other difference is on policy versus identity. This is really the question that’s kind of at the heart of a lot of debates about voting behavior these days—whether voters are oriented toward policy commitments that candidates and parties make, or if they vote based on deeply held social identities. And we see that a pretty substantial amount of the variance in responses on that question is explained by cross-country variation but, again, only among the politicians.\n\nSo it seems that there is something to be said for the experience of particular kinds of institutional structures or party systems in the development of the theories that you have about voters, especially on these two debates. But on the others, it’s much more consistent across countries.\n\nDemsas: One way to read your results, right—the fact that there’s such a difference between how voters view themselves and, you know, I guess many people would view it as, like, voters have a more rosy picture about themselves and what they’re doing than politicians do—is that voters are lying about themselves. And I think particularly in this moment, where there are a lot of people who are calling voters stupid for one reason or another, it can be tempting to just assume that voters are full of it, right? Like, that they’re just wanting to sound nicer than they are.\n\nBut there’s another study that pairs quite nicely with this that just came out recently in PNAS by a friend of the show, David Broockman and his frequent co-author Josh Kalla, about whether political practitioners have good instincts. So what they do is they basically measure the effects of a bunch of messages, real ones that politicians have either tweeted out or, like, the Heritage Foundation, for example, has put in documents, or other partisan outfits have put out about, you know, marijuana or guns or whatever. And then they ask political practitioners and lay people to predict which ones were effective. They find that political practitioners and lay people both performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects. And you don’t really see much difference in those two groups.\n\nThis is obviously a different sort of study. They’re looking at different questions here. But there’s something here about our expectations that political professionals really understand the public better than the public understands itself. Like, maybe it’s the case that voters are more correct. So where do you fall in this? Like, I know you already said that you are more of a democratic optimist, but why would politicians be wrong about how voter publics are thinking about voting?\n\nLucas: Yeah, that’s a great question. One of the things I love about the work that David Broockman and his co-authors, Luke Hewitt and the others, have been doing on persuasion is that, in a way, it reveals how important politicians’ theories of the world really are. Because if it’s extremely difficult to know, for example, what kind of message is going to be persuasive in advance—in the absence of an experiment, kind of A/B testing persuasiveness, it’s really hard to know in advance—that opens a lot of room for people to rely on their intuitive working theories of the world to make decisions about what they’re going to do and how they’re going to behave, and in that case, what kind of advertisements to run, but also how to campaign or how to represent their constituents more generally.\n\nSo I think it’s just really difficult to learn about voting behavior from direct experience when you’re a politician. So there’s a lot of noise mixed in with the signal. It looks, based on our evidence, like politicians tend to be surrounded by democratic realists, and so it’s a little less likely that they’re going to update starkly on what seems like policy information. If you’re surrounded by people who have a different theory, you’re more likely to sort of retain that theory.\n\nAnd just in general, it’s very easy to interpret election results in a variety of ways. So you can imagine a scenario where a party runs an election campaign which is really focused on social identity, in-group appeals, anti-outgroup kind of sentiment, etcetera, and that party loses. And sure, a politician in that party could say, Well, I’m gonna update my theory a little bit and say, maybe, social identities aren’t as important as I thought. Or they might say, Well, we didn’t go far enough. We need to double down. We didn’t really fully commit. I mean, we hear this kind of thing in politics from campaign strategists and politicians and so forth sometimes.\n\nSo the feedback mechanism is really noisy, and the way that politicians learn about voting behavior is sometimes—you know, you’re getting conflicting signals sometimes, and it’s really hard to know. So I wouldn’t necessarily say that they’re always wrong, but you can imagine a mechanism where politicians, even though they have an incentive to know true information about how voter behavior really works, could hold theories that aren’t actually accurate.\n\nDemsas: So if voters were right about their own views of themselves, then wouldn’t that sort of imply that they were able to get good information about what elected officials are trying to do? We had this episode a few months ago on the show with Hunter Rendleman, who had a paper about the earned-income tax credit and looking at, in the United States, whether voters were actually responsive to governors expanding this social-welfare benefit in their state. And she is kind of an outlier in this field—well, I wouldn’t say outlier. She’s in the minority in the field of believing that voters, especially at the state level, are able to see and respond effectively to policies that may benefit them, that they say that they like.\n\nSo like, I guess my question to you is, like, why don’t we see more of these results in political science then? Why don’t we see voters responding positively to policies that they say that they want, that they like? Why don’t we see politicians recognizing this? Like, doesn’t this kind of push against a lot of our intuitions about how democracy is not really working right now?\n\nLucas: Yeah, I think it does. I will say, though, that we do have, even now, quite a bit of evidence that things like clear-eyed retrospection and policy commitments among parties still may matter. I mean, we have some evidence, for example, that more extreme candidates who run for office do worse than more moderate candidates coming from the same parties, and that suggests that voters are incorporating the information about the policy positions of these candidates into their choices.\n\nThe other thing to say is that I don’t think even the most fiercely committed spatial-voting theorists today would probably not want to claim that voters have the same level of importance or attach the same level of salience to every policy issue. And on a lot of issues, it does appear to be true that voters haven’t thought about it much. A party takes a position on that issue, and they just adopt the position of their preferred party.\n\nBut there can be an important difference between policy issues in general and the issues that you really do care about or think about a little more regularly. And we have some pretty good evidence that a lot of people—not all, but a lot of people—do have one or two issues that they care about with particular strength. And if their party abandoned their preferred position on those issues, there’s some reason to think that the voters would notice.\n\nSo I think you’re right that the citizens’ responses in the survey reflect a level of optimism that doesn’t seem to be manifested in the kinds of voting behavior that we’re seeing in elections right now. And so recent elections, I think, maybe lead you to think that there’s something persuasive about democratic realism. Let’s put it that way.\n\nDemsas: Well, I guess to steelman it, right, because the case that some people will make about Donald Trump, for instance, who I think is maybe the elephant in the room in every conversation right now, is that, you know, Donald Trump did attempt to moderate on key political promises. When he was running for office, he disavowed—well, he distanced himself, at least—he distanced himself from the most extreme parts of the pro-life movement. How reasonable you find that, given that he appointed members of the Supreme Court who were responsible for the end of Roe v. Wade, you know, your mileage might vary there.\n\nBut you know, he did distance himself verbally during the campaign. And there are reports that people believed he was interested in expanding IVF access and that people found that promise to be credible. On Medicaid and Social Security, he’s made multiple comments in public that he doesn’t want to touch. Of course, this was when he was running. Now that DOGE is happening, it’s unclear whether those promises will remain true.\n\nBut there is a story you could tell where Donald Trump really attempted on key issues to the electorate to appear more moderate. And there was—I mean, speaking of spatial voting—a survey where they looked at how the average voter saw themselves on sort of a left–right spectrum. And they saw themselves much closer to Donald Trump than to Kamala Harris. And to me, that indicates that, you know, regardless of whether people find some of his other policy positions and commitments to liberal democracy to be disqualifying, the voting public clearly saw many of his policy commitments as closer to where they were.\n\nLucas: Yes. Well, let me first say, as you well know, there’s quite an industry of research on the correlates of vote choice for Donald Trump these days, and I don’t have a particular comparative advantage on that as a person who mostly studies Canadian politics.\n\nBut a couple of pieces to put into the mix here that are absolutely happening: I mean, one, the point you made about policy voting, I think, is true. You see much more attention to cultural policy issues, in general, in recent elections and particular attention to immigration. And on those issues, there was some kind of policy alignment that Donald Trump was able to create, I think, that’s really important.\n\nBut the big thing I think I would point out is just this long-run trend toward personalization in politics. This is captured by our “party versus leaders” kind of theoretical debate in the paper—that people seem to be voting more and more on the basis of a particular leader’s character and competence in the eyes of voters, and that’s separate from their specific policy commitments. So even though we still see some evidence of spatial voting these days, it’s also true that when you look at many countries, including the United States, there’s very strong evidence of leader-based voting, where people are voting for somebody because they like that person, they like their character, or whatever.\n\nAnd they’re adopting the policy positions of that leader kind of after having decided that they really like them. So it’s, If this party leader has this view, then maybe I should have that view as well. And that’s not something that we would expect from spatial-voting theory, and it is something that seems to be happening in many countries, and so I think that’s definitely true.\n\nDemsas: After the break: the foreign national election that is somehow about Trump.\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: Well, let’s bring you to Canada, which remains a separate country from the United States. (Laughs.)\n\nIn Canada right now, the Conservative Party was slated to win quite handily. But things have changed, both after Trudeau resigned but notably after Trump was elected. And in particular, the kind of bump comes in January, when he is about to come into power and the threat of tariffs was becoming more real. How does that drastic shift towards the Liberals fit within these theories of voting behavior? I feel like there are a lot of stories you could tell.\n\nLucas: There are a lot of stories you could tell, and I suppose the story is still in the process of being written.\n\nBut one of the things that has happened in Canada since Pierre Poilievre became the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada is that we’ve had a radical shift in the kinds of issues that we’re talking about. And so whereas this time last year, we might have been talking about carbon taxes and the excesses of woke politics or whatever, now the focus is trade, economic health, economic survival, etcetera.\n\nAnd so we have an incoming leader of the Liberal Party who’s a former governor of two national banks, who is, I think most would agree, very competent on economic-policy issues. And that’s occurring at a moment when economic policy is just more salient than it has been in a long time. And there’s some really nice examples in the literature where researchers have seen that for parties, either an issue becomes extremely salient unexpectedly, or parties surprisingly change positions on an issue.\n\nAnd that gives you an opportunity to see what effect it has on voting. So a policy-voting theorist would expect in Canada that, because trade and the economy have become so salient, voters are going to—maybe a voter who would have otherwise supported the Conservatives, for example, but they trust Mark Carney’s Liberals to deal best with the trade issue—may shift their vote in the direction of the Liberals if it’s about that particular policy being important to them.\n\nDemsas: That raises, for me, a question about how stable you would expect findings about people’s self-assessments and politicians’ assessments of voter publics to be on these political theories. Like, do you think you’ve captured something lasting or just a snapshot of 2022 and 2023, when you were doing these surveys?\n\nLucas: There is evidence that politicians’ theories of voting behavior do evolve over time. There’s a study by John Kingdon many years ago, which compared candidates who had recently won an election and candidates who had recently lost an election. And as you may imagine, the candidates who lost were a little more cynical about voters’ capacities.\n\nSo certainly, politicians learn from experience. They become more or less optimistic, I think, based on how things seem to be going. But we have been asking these same questions of local politicians in Canada each year, going back a number of years now, and we see that there is some meaningful stability to the responses they give.\n\nSo we find that there’s some correlation year over year in their responses, in the way that you would expect if their responses are tapping into some meaningful position on the debate. So they’re certainly not perfectly correlated; there’s plenty of measurement error in these questions. But there’s a relationship over time that suggests that politicians have somewhat stable views on this.\n\nNow, among the general public, our working theory of what citizens are doing when they answer these questions is essentially accessing top-of-mind cultural narratives about how democracy works. We don’t want to make the claim that when members of the general public encounter these questions, they think, Well, I’m glad you asked, because I’ve been spending the last eight months thinking about prospective versus retrospective voting, and here’s my position.\n\nIt’s more like, What is the most common top-of-mind, culturally available or culturally acceptable narrative about how democracy works? I think that’s a reasonable inference about what those general-public responses reflect. And so the important thing for our purposes is to say, If it’s true that this is your kind of default, culturally accessible story about voters and voting behavior and elections, then it’s remarkable that politicians have developed a very different kind of theory that doesn’t reflect those highly accessible kinds of cultural narratives.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. I wonder, too, about which way the causal arrow goes, right? Like, is it that working in politics makes politicians more likely to have these democratic-realist views of voters? Or that there’s a selection effect going on whereby democratic realists are more likely to become politicians? Does your study give us any insight into that?\n\nLucas: Yeah, I love this question. I’m sort of obsessed by it, actually. How politicians come to develop these theories, I think, is super interesting. So we have some clues about this, but really nothing more than clues in the paper as it stands.\n\nOne thing we can say is that more senior politicians are a little more likely to be democratic realists than more junior politicians. So it’s not a huge difference. It’s, like, 60 percent versus 68 percent when you compare the junior to the senior. But there’s a difference there, which suggests that politicians learn; they become more democratic realist in their theories over time as they move through their political careers. So they’re not arriving on the scene kind of fully formed, hardcore democratic realists, it looks like from the data.\n\nThe other sort of clue that we have is that we can compare members of the general public whose demographic characteristics most closely resemble politicians—because, of course, politicians are not a random draw from the public. They tend to be older, better educated, more wealthy, and so forth. So we can look at citizens who match those characteristics of politicians and compare them to the politicians. And we still see there’s an enormous gap between citizens who are kind of like politicians in their demographics and politicians.\n\nAnd so that suggests there is something like the selection effect you describe going on, where people who have these kinds of views about politics—maybe because they’ve become involved in politics, and they’ve learned these theories from others, more senior people who are involved in politics, early in their career, before they even jump into politics themselves as a candidate—but something is going on to select people who are disproportionately likely to be democratic realists in the first place. And then it seems like the political experience is reinforcing those views over time.\n\nDemsas: So I guess another story I could tell is that the reason why older, more experienced politicians are morally democratic realists is: Maybe cynical people kind of stick it out longer in politics.\n\nLucas: Could be.\n\nDemsas: And I guess the reason why I am pondering that story is because if you abstract away from politics, if you’re just talking generally about someone with expertise in a field or in a job, you’d expect that over time, that you get better at doing the job, right? Even if you’re just, like, learning from your environment. You’re, like, picking things up generally. But also just in politics, it’s not exactly like the private sector, but there is, like, a win-loss condition that’s extremely impactful, both to your financial interests but also your identity, like desires in life and your self-conception as a successful person. And so you’d expect people to get better over time the longer they stay in there, or at least better at winning elections, which I would think requires understanding how to get voters to vote for you. So I don’t know how plausible you find that story.\n\nLucas: It’s true that there’s a certain species of very senior politician that has become quite grizzled and cynical about voting and voting behavior. We heard from them because we did these interviews face-to-face with the politicians. So as they work through the survey, because they’re politicians and they generally like to talk, they would sometimes provide a little color commentary as they’re working through the questions. And I certainly remember some very senior politicians in Canada saying, Well, you know, I’m sorry to say it, but voters are not that knowledgeable. You know, that kind of “grizzled old veteran” view of politics.\n\nBut yeah, I mean, I think that you would expect there to be some kind of learning mechanism. The tricky thing is, and the thing that we have to ponder here is how involved politicians are in different countries in making decisions about the campaigns they run and the consequences of those campaigns.\n\nSo we think it really matters what politicians’ theories of voting and elections are for the choices they make about how they behave as representatives and how they communicate with constituents and maybe how they campaign. But how they campaign is quite variable. Depending on if you’re looking at, like, a closed-list PR system in Portugal or a single-member plurality system in Canada, you have kind of varying levels of control over how you present yourself to voters.\n\nSo I think you would expect that the machinery of campaigns would improve over time. But that may not be reflected very directly in the theories that individual politicians hold about voters and voting behavior. And the other twist on this, going back to the paper you mentioned and more generally the research agenda that David Broockman and his co-authors are doing on persuasion: Using the swayable experiment data, they show that the factors that predict whether an advertisement in their case is persuasive are quite context dependent. They change over time. So what predicts persuasiveness in one election looks different in the next election. And so it may be harder to learn. There may be less of a sort of evolutionary convergence toward the optimal election strategy than you expect, because each election has dynamics that are so different from the previous one.\n\nDemsas: So one of the axes I definitely want to ask you about is on sociotropic versus egocentric voting, because I think that’s been a big point of debate in the American context. To define things, sociotropic means, like, kind of voting in the national interest, versus egocentric, in self-interest, sometimes referred to, I think, as pocketbook voting.\n\nSo my friend and colleague Derek Thompson had this fun piece titled “‘Everything Is Terrible, but I’m Fine.’” We’ll link it in the show notes. And he points to a couple of indicators where people say that their own personal situation, you know, they’re doing pretty well. Like, on finances, they look at consumer sentiment. But if you ask about the nation as a whole, they think we’re, like, being fed to the dogs. You know what I mean? And it’s, like, this massive divergence between people’s self-assessments and even their local-community assessments and the national context.\n\nYou know, we’ve seen this, also, in crime, as well, when you ask people about how much crime is happening, but also about public schools. Like, people usually like their public schools, but they’ll say, like, Public schooling in the country is just absolutely trash. So lots of poli-sci literature shows that voters are sociotropic in their voting, which feels pretty weird to me. I would assume people would be self-interested.\n\nAnd there was a 2017 study in ASPR by Andrew Healy, Mikael Persson, and Erik Snowberg, which showed that voters do focus on their own pocketbook as well as national assessments of how the country is going, which is a more moderate view. I guess, like most things, people are doing both of these all the time. But what do you find in your survey? How are people thinking about these questions?\n\nLucas: Politicians overwhelmingly think that voters are egocentric. And citizens are a little more divided, but they tend to think that voters are more sociotropic. And if there’s any one of these debates where one could I most strongly claim that the politicians have it wrong, this is probably the one that you’d pick. I mean, this is actually one where we got a little bit of pushback when we were presenting the paper to some colleagues, and they said, Well, you call these debates, but we all know that it’s sociotropic. So it’s not really a debate, is it? But as you say, there’s the “Digging Into the Pocketbook” paper by Healy et al. And it uses really high-quality Swedish registry data, where you know survey respondents’ actual tax records and their personal financial situation, and it suggests that the pocketbook voting does happen.\n\nThere’s some other evidence like this, but I do think that the consensus for a long time—and it was unexpected at first but has grown over time to be, I think, accepted as consensus—is that sociotropic voting is most of what people are doing when they engage in retrospective thinking about: How well are things going? And on that basis, will I reward or punish the incumbent? So on this one, I think you could make a pretty good case that the politicians’ general consensus is not the same as the political scientists’ general consensus.\n\nDemsas: I mean this “sociotropic versus pocketbook” really fits into what happened with the Biden administration. I mean, I hear from Biden officials all the time that they’re like, Well, if you look at people’s personal financial situation, they were doing much better when you look at real wages, or all these, like, debates. But then, of course, you know, a lot about the American economy was great in the last couple years in terms of growth, but inflation as a macro story was really high.\n\nAnd it’s funny—even as people have understood that inflation was a big part of this election, they still talk about it in terms of their pocketbooks, right? They’re still like, Oh, the reason why inflation was so harmful to the Biden administration’s reelection efforts and, of course, Harris’s election effort was because people had to pay too much for eggs or for milk or for whatever. But it seems like: No. People actually really do care about the national vibe of these things. And I mean, to me, that’s actually a very optimistic view of my fellow countrymen, that, like, Even if I’m doing okay—you know, my wages are pretty good; I got a house in 2021 with a 2 percent mortgage rate—like, I still care that inflation’s doing really badly across the whole country.\n\nLucas: Yeah. Well, I’m all for your optimistic take on your fellow countrymen. I mean, why not? But I suppose the democratic-realist response, the sort of slight devil’s advocate response here would be that the sociotropic retrospection depends much more clearly on a perception of how well things are going that may be quite a bit less clearly linked to reality. So you kind of know what your income is and how it’s changing and probably know how much your groceries are costing week by week, but to have a clear perception of how well the economy has done over the last four years on a number of indicators is more challenging, and so more susceptible to elite framing and so forth. So I suppose the-glass-half-empty story would be: It’s just much more malleable.\n\nDemsas: I was looking at the response rate from your data collection from the politicians, and it’s highly variable. I was really surprised. I don’t know if you read anything into it. In Canada, where you are: 12 percent response rate, and that’s the lowest of any country you guys reach out to in this study. And in Belgium, the response rate is 85 percent. Does that mean anything to you about the politicians you have or the system? (Laughs.)\n\nLucas: What it means to me is that my colleagues on this project love to tease me about our low response rate in Canada. So thank you for bringing that up. This is sort of an enduring mystery of elite research that nobody really quite understands.\n\nSo there’s two pieces to this. One is that the Belgian team are a bunch of wizards when it comes to attracting and recruiting politicians to participate in their studies. They’re just tireless and really amazing at what they do, and so part of their high response rate is definitely down to their hard work and the credibility that they’ve built over the years with the politicians in that country.\n\nBut we also see systematic differences in response rates across countries. When you do surveys of politicians, the response rates in North America are just lower, no matter how much you beg, what strategies you employ. They’re just a lot lower, and nobody seems to know—I mean, even within Europe, there’s a lot of variation—nobody seems to know exactly why. It’s not entirely a function of how many requests they receive. Because we see some very large countries, where the politicians are getting a lot of requests, have low response rates, and some big countries have high response rates. It’s a bit of a mystery, to be honest with you.\n\nBut yes, the response rates are quite variable across countries. And even though we have a large number of politicians in total, it is certainly true that more of those politicians come from some countries than from others.\n\nDemsas: Do you worry about selection effects in countries with low response rates? Like, you’re getting responses from people who are especially motivated to engage in this research versus one where you’re getting kind of broad representation?\n\nLucas: Yeah, absolutely. This is something that we worry about, and it’s especially the case because this isn’t a random sample of politicians. I mean, I suppose there’s really no random samples out there anymore. But this is certainly an opt-in study. We invite them to participate. We send invitations to all of the politicians, and those who choose to participate, they do. And the other ones don’t. So yes, we have to think about this a lot.\n\nAnd so one of the things you can do is just collect as much background information on all of the politicians in the country that you can, and then you can compare the people who participate in the survey to the full population of politicians to get some sense of how different they are. And what we find is that on most of the observables that we collect, the politicians who participate in our study look a lot like the broader population of politicians. So that’s true on age, gender, on the party they come from, the ideological flavor of the party they come from. On many of those things, we don’t see any particular reason to worry.\n\nThe one thing I would flag as a difference between our sample and the population is that the participants in our study do tend to be a little bit more junior in their careers. So the amount of time they’ve had in office is a little less, and it’s not surprising that’s the case, because if you’re a cabinet minister or a prime minister or a party leader or something who’s been around a long time, you probably have less time to spend with us answering questions about politics. So—\n\nDemsas: But that could actually cut both ways, interestingly. Because one way you could read that is like, Oh, are you missing out on people with the most information about voters? But junior people are the ones who just had to win potentially more difficult elections, because they don’t have, you know, the incumbency advantage or the party connections in parliamentary systems. And so, you know, they maybe are actually more closely aligned with what voters are looking for right then.\n\nLucas: Yeah, that’s exactly the logic I think you have to use to think this through, is if you do have a slight underrepresentation from some group, like, what evidence is there that the people in that group would be different in their responses to the people, when compared to the people who did respond? So we can look at the smaller number of very senior politicians who are participants in our study, and we can say, Is there any evidence that our findings are really particularly influenced by a slight underrepresentation among those folks? And that’s a way that you can kind of test this out.\n\nAnd we find that the people who don’t participate in these surveys, partly because of how many politicians do participate, they would have to be so dramatically, kind of implausibly different in their views from the people who do participate to change the results. That gives us some confidence. But yes, you’re right. I mean, it could be an advantage. Sometimes you want overrepresentation from certain kinds of participants in order to get their views a little more clearly.\n\nDemsas: So can I ask why you guys don’t have America in your sample? Just because it’s an American show.\n\nLucas: Yeah. This is a good question. It’s a little bit above my pay grade, but I think that if I can speculate a little or put words in Stefaan Walgrave’s mouth a little bit: I mentioned how response rates in Canada are quite low relative to Belgium or Switzerland and so forth. The response rates in studies of national politicians, especially, in the United States are even lower.\n\nDemsas: Brutal.\n\nLucas: So the prospect of getting members of Congress to sit down with us for 30 or 40, 45 minutes and participate in this study, I think, are really low. Now, we could still explore maybe state-level politicians or state-level politicians in very big states. There are alternatives here, but for the moment, I mean, this project started in Europe, and it seems to be continuing to expand. So it may be that down the road, the United States is included in future rounds.\n\nI will tell you, though, that we have collected data on these questions in the United States, separately from the POLPOP project. There are local-politician responses. It’s not the national politicians, but we still do have some information about where American politicians stand on these questions. So if you’re curious about the American politicians, I can tell you a little something about them. Although, they’re not exactly equivalent to the others in this study.\n\nSo we have data from about, I think, 580 American local politicians. These are mayors and councilors from municipalities above about 1,000 population. And what we found is that two-thirds of the American local politicians are democratic realists. So what that tells me is two things: First, the majority of American local politicians are democratic realists, just like every other country that we study, and second, in Canada, we can compare local politicians to federal and provincial politicians. And we find the local politicians tend to be a little bit less likely to be democratic realists. And so if we extrapolate that logic to the United States, my guess is that you’re probably seeing proportions that are similar to Canada, like 80–85 percent of national politicians espousing these democratic-realist positions. That’s a guess, but it’s an educated guess based on the data that we have from American local politicians.\n\nWe also see some differences across party. For the most part, two things: The American local politicians are more democratic realist in character than the Canadian local politicians, and second, there’s not that much difference between the two parties. So only on the question of identity versus policy do we see meaningful, statistically distinguishable differences between the parties, where the Democrats are more identity-oriented theorists, and the Republicans are more policy oriented. So Democrats are a little more likely to think that voters are identity oriented, that they kind of make their voting decisions based on deeply held social identities, when compared to Republicans. So that’s an interesting—\n\nDemsas: When did you do this survey? What year?\n\nLucas: It was 2022 when we did this survey of American local politicians.\n\nDemsas: So I guess that would indicate that Democratic politicians—well, like, if we assume that voters are correct about why they vote and voters in the United States are similar to the voters you’re seeing in your sample of other Western democracies in your newer paper, that would indicate to me that Democrats are worse than Republicans at assessing voters’ behavior. Is that what you’re getting?\n\nLucas: It could be. It could be that Democratic voters really are more oriented to social identity. I mean, there’s this long-standing argument that the Democratic Party is more of a coalition of groups, and the Republican Party has been, at least historically, focused on particular kinds of policy commitments. I don’t feel like I’m in a position to adjudicate the persuasiveness of that argument. But it is out there that maybe the factors that predict voting are a little bit different among Democratic voters than Republican voters. So that’s possible.\n\nAnd it’s also possible that just by virtue of being socialized into a particular political party, you learn slightly different theories from your mentors and campaign strategists and campaign managers and so on, and that there’s just, like, a slightly different subculture in those two different parties.\n\nDemsas: Always our last question is: What is something that you once thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nLucas: Well, I’m embarrassed to admit, I have always had a bit of a weakness for the life-hacks genre of online writing, which means I’ve tried many, many things that turned out to be a bad idea. But let me give you a non-life-hack example.\n\nSo when I started my job at the university, I was so excited to have gotten an academic position, and I felt like I really wanted to give this new role the respect that it deserved. So I came up with this romantic idea that I was gonna write all of my lectures word for word, and there are gonna be these beautiful lectures that had allusions to poetry and history and so forth.\n\nAnd I can tell you that the look on my students’ faces when I showed up in a classroom in 2015, and they realized I was gonna be lecturing at them like it was a sort of Oxford College in 1875, they were not thrilled. So I quickly realized I needed to adopt a teaching style that was somewhat more appropriate for the century I was living in.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you so much, Jack.

        "content": "KURT VONNEGUT, JR., is a native of Indianapolis who left Cornell in 1942 to serve as an Army combat intelligence scout. He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and spent five months in a Dresden prison camp. He is now working for General Electric in Schenectady and writing a novel in his spare time.\n\nEditor’s Note: KURT VONNEGUT, JR., is a native of Indianapolis who left Cornell in 1942 to serve as an Army combat intelligence scout. He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and spent five months in a Dresden prison camp. He is now working for General Electric in Schenectady and writing a novel in his spare time.\n\n“I was astonished one day in 1944, in the midst of front-line hell-raising, to learn that I had been made interpreter, Dolmetscher if you please … It had never entered my head that I had what it took to dolmetsch.”\n\nI WAS astonished one day in 1944, in the midst of front-line hell-raising, to learn that I had been made interpreter, Dolmetscher if you please, for a whole battalion, and was to be billeted in a Belgian burgomaster’s house within artillery range of the Siegfried Line.\n\nIt had never entered my head that I had what it took to dolmetsch. I qualified for the position while waiting to move from France into the front lines. While a student, I had learned the first stanza of Die Lorelei by rote from a college roommate, and I happened to give those lines a dogged rendition while working within earshot of the battalion commander. The colonel (a hotel detective from Mobile) asked his executive officer (a dry-goods salesman from Knoxville) in what language the lyrics were. The executive withheld judgment until I had bungled through Der Gipfel des Berges foo-unk-kelt im Abendsonnenschein.\n\n“Ah believes tha’s Kraut, Cuhnel,” he said.\n\nThe colonel felt that his role carried with it the obligation to make quick, headstrong decisions. He made some dandies before the Wehrmacht was whipped, but the one he made that day was my favorite. “If tha’s Kraut, whassat man doin’ on the honey-dippin’ detail?” he wanted to know. Two hours later, the company clerk told me to lay down the buckets, for I was now battalion interpreter.\n\nOrders to move up came soon after. Those in authority were too harried to hear my declarations of incompetence. “You talk Kraut good enough foah us,” said the executive officer. “Theah ain’t goin’ to be much talkin’ to Krauts where we’re goin’.” He patted my rifle affectionately. “Heah’s what’s goin’ to do most of youah interpretin’ fo’ ya,” he said. The executive, who learned everything he knew from the colonel, had the idea that the American Army had just licked the Belgians, and that I was to be stationed with the burgomaster to make sure he didn’t try to pull a fast one. “Besides,” the executive concluded, “theah ain’t nobody else can talk Kraut at all.”\n\nI rode to the burgomaster’s farm on the same truck with three disgruntled Pennsylvania Dutchmen who had applied for interpreters’ jobs months earlier. When I made it clear that I was no competition for them, and that I hoped to be liquidated within twenty-four hours, they warmed up enough to furnish the interesting information that I was a Dolmetscher. They also decoded Die Lorelei at my request. This gave me command of about forty words (par for a two-year-old), but no combination of them\n\nwould get me so much as a glass of cold water.\n\nEvery turn of the truck’s wheels brought a new question: “What’s the word for Army? . . . How do I ask for the bathroom? . . . What’s the word for sick? . . . well? . . . dish? . . . brother? . . . shoe?” My phlegmatic instructors tired, and one handed me a pamphlet purporting to make German easy for the man in the foxhole.\n\n“Some of the first pages are missing,” the donor explained as I jumped from the truck before the burgomaster’s stone farmhouse. “Used ‘em for cigarette papers,” he said.\n\nIt was still dark when I knocked at the burgomaster’s door. I stood on the doorstep like a bit player in the wings, with the one line I was to deliver banging around an otherwise empty head. The door swung open. “Dolmetscher,” I said.\n\nThe burgomaster himself, old, thin, and nightshirted, ushered me into the first-floor bedroom which was to be mine. He pantomimed as well as spoke his welcome, and a sprinkling of danke schön was adequate dolmetsching for the time being. I was prepared to throttle further discussion with Ich weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten, dass ich so traurig bin. This would have sent him padding off to bed, convinced that he had a fluent, albeit shot-full-of-Weltschmerz, Dolmetscher. The stratagem wasn’t necessary. He left me alone to consolidate my resources.\n\nChief among these resources was the mutilated pamphlet. I examined each of its precious pages in turn, delighted by the simplicity of transposing English into German. With this booklet, all I had to do was to run my finger down the left-hand column until I found the English phrase I wanted, and then rattle off the nonsense syllables printed opposite in the right-hand column. “How many grenade launchers have you?” for instance, was Vee feel grenada vairfair habben zee? Impeccable German for “Where are your tank columns?” proved to be nothing more troublesome than Vo zint eara pantzer shpitzen? I mouthed the phrases: “Where are your howitzers? How many machine guns have you? Surrender! Don’t shoot! Where have you hidden your motorcycle? Hands up! What unit are you from?”\n\nThe pamphlet came to an abrupt end, toppling my spirits from manic to depressive. The Pennsylvania Dutchman had smoked up all the rear area pleasantries, comprising the pamphlet’s first half, leaving me with nothing to work with but the repartee of hand-to-hand fighting.\n\nAs I lay sleepless in bed, the one drama in which I could play took shape in my mind. . . .\n\nDOLMETSCHER (to BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER): I don’t know what will become of me, I am so sad. (Embraces her.)\n\nBURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER (with yielding shyness): The air is cool, and it’s getting dark, and the Rhine is flowing quietly.\n\n(DOLMETSCHER seizes BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER, carries her bodily into his room.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER (softly): Surrender.\n\n(Enter BURGOMASTER.)\n\nBURGOMASTER (brandishing Luger): Ach!\n\nHands up!\n\nDOLMETSCHER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER: Don’t shoot!\n\n(A Large map, shelving disposition of American First Army, falls from BURGOMASTER’S breast pocket.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER (aside, in English): What is this supposedly pro-Ally Burgomaster doing with a map showing the disposition of the American First Army? (He snatches 45 automatic pistol from beneath pillow and aims at BURGOMASTER.)\n\nBURGOMASTER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER: Don’t shoot! (BURGOMASTER drops Luger, cowers, sneers.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER: What unit are you from? (BURGOMASTER remains sullen, silent. BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER goes to his side, weeps softly. DOLMETSCHER pauses significantly, suddenly points at BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER.) Where have you hidden your motorcycle? (Turns again to Burgomaster.) Where are your howitzers, eh? Where are your tank columns? How many grenade launchers have you?\n\nBURGOMASTER (cracking under terrific grilling): I —\n\n(Enter Guard Detail composed of Pennsylvania Dutchmen, making a routine check just in time to hear BURGOMASTER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTERconfess to being Nazi agents parachuted behind American lines.)\n\nJohann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller couldn’t have done any better with the same words, and they were the only words I had. There was no chance of my muddling through, and no pleasure in being interpreter for a full battalion in December and not being able to say so much as “Merry Christmas.”\n\nI made my bed, tightened the drawstrings on my duffel bag, and stole through the black-out curtains and into the night.\n\nWary sentinels directed me to Battalion Headquarters, where I found most of our officers either poring over maps or loading their weapons. There was a holiday spirit in the air, and the executive officer was honing an eighteen-inch bowie knife and humming Are You from Dixie?\n\n“Well, bless mah soul,”he said, noticing me standing in the door, “here’s old ‘sprecken zee Dutch.’ Speak up, boy. Ain’t you supposed to be ovah at the mayah’s house?”\n\n“It’s no good,” I said. “They all speak Low German, and I speak High.”\n\nThe executive was impressed. “Too good foah ‘em, eh?” He ran his index finger down the edge of his murderous knife. “Ah think we’ll he runnin’ into some who can talk the high-class Kraut putty soon,” he said, and then added, “Weah surrounded.”\n\n“We’ll whomp ‘em the way we whomped ‘em in Nawth Ca’lina and Tennessee,” said the colonel, who had never lost a maneuver. “You stay heah, son. Ah’m gonna want you foah mah pussnel intupretah.”\n\nTwenty minutes later I was in the thick of dolmetsching again. Four Tiger tanks drove up to the front door of Headquarters, and two dozen German infantrymen dismounted to round us up with submachine guns.\n\n“Say sumpin’,” ordered the colonel, spunky to the last.\n\nI ran my eye down the left-hand columns of my pamphlet until I found the phrase which most fairly represented our sentiments. “Don’t shoot,” I said.\n\nA German tank officer swaggered in to have a look at his catch. In his hand was a pamphlet, somewhat smaller than mine. “Where are your howitzers?” he said.",

        "content": "In 1940, just before his death, the theorist Walter Benjamin conjured a famous metaphor for watching the past: the “Angel of History.” The angel was inspired by a print, Angelus Novus, by his friend Paul Klee, which features a great and beneficent being with his wings spread wide. Whereas we humans experience life as a chain of chronological events, the angel, Benjamin writes, faces the past and watches a tower of debris growing taller and taller, burying the victims of history. However much the angel wants to “make whole what is smashed,” he is helpless against the wind propelling him into the future.\n\nThe author who writes after great catastrophe frequently assumes the angel’s position: Many historical novels float above history, bearing witness but drawing simple lessons, or casting dogmatic judgment, from the safe vantage of the present. In these books, the crises of earlier eras are held at a distance. By charting the course from then to now, these authors find comfort in the fact that time passes on, leaving the past safely in the past.\n\nYet for those surrounded by the debris, history remains a living thing. Over the course of her life, the Japanese writer Yuko Tsushima, who was born just after World War II and died in 2016, witnessed firsthand how a nation and a society can transform completely without ever losing the scars of its past. In Wildcat Dome, published in 2013 and newly translated by Lisa Hofmann-Kuroda, she narrates more than half a century of her country’s history, from wartime defeat and American occupation to the political and social upheavals of reconstruction. But rather than holding herself at a remove, Tsushima imbues these traumatic and transformative decades with a vivid and disturbing vitality, and uncovers in the process an unsettled zone where nothing is made whole, and not even the dead can rest.\n\nRead: The careful craft of writing female subjectivity\n\nWildcat Dome is told across the span of Japan’s postwar recovery, when it reinvented itself as an American ally and a cultural juggernaut. With the loss of its colonial empire, it became a junior partner in globalization, shipping its artistic and material products around the world. A common narrative holds that the cataclysm of Japanese defeat became a site of reinvention, allowing a peaceful democracy to rise from the ashes. Yet Tsushima begins her novel with a disaster that reopens the damage of the past for both its main character and his nation. It’s the spring of 2011, and an elderly man named Mitch has returned to Tokyo, the city of his childhood, after years spent abroad. Mitch’s life has been an accumulation of catastrophes both big and small. The son of a Japanese woman likely raped by an American GI, he is abandoned after World War II at an orphanage full of children with similar parentage. Growing up in the immediate postwar decades, these mixed-race children are a palpable reminder to their neighbors of Japan’s losses and occupation, a legacy as radioactive as atomic fallout.\n\nWildcat Dome By Yuko Tsushima\n\nAt a young age, Mitch was crushed by a portable heater, leaving him with a lifelong limp that set him apart from friends and lovers, if only in his own eyes. Around him, Japan is rising and remaking itself. Yet Mitch cannot overcome his childhood agonies or mature with his peers or his country. What draws him back to Japan after decades abroad is another atomic catastrophe—the meltdown of reactors at Fukushima following 2011’s earthquake and tsunami. “For years,” Tsushima writes, “Mitch had denounced Japan, wishing this hateful country would disappear from the face of the earth.” Now that seems finally to be happening.\n\nThe greatest disaster of Mitch’s life is more intimate in scale. One day, a few years after his adoption by a local woman, Mitch is playing hide and seek with his adopted brother, Kazu, and their friend Yonko, when the three children witness the drowning of a young girl named Miki-chan. The murderer is Tabo, a disturbing, reclusive boy from the neighborhood surrounding the orphanage, and his crime is frightening and mysterious; none of the children seem to understand Tabo’s motive, not even the boy himself. Perhaps it was an accident, the children reason. Maybe he was provoked by the color of the girl’s orange skirt? Yet rumors soon begin to swirl, pinning the “accident” on this trio—these mixed-race children, viewed with suspicion, and their playmate. Mitch and Kazu’s beloved Mama protects them by shipping them off to a boarding school in England.\n\nThe children grow up, move forward with their lives, take on new names and countries. Yet nothing is fully within their control, as if they have been marked by that formative blight. Every decade or so, no matter how far apart Mitch, Kazu, and Yonko have drifted, they are drawn back to one another by some news story involving the murder of a woman who was wearing something orange. For these children of misfortune, the disparate crimes come to feel like “the same event repeating itself over and over, till it made you sick,” Mitch thinks. They are stuck, all “living alone at the bottom of this pond” with Miki-chan, unable either to drown or to surface. Unlike Benjamin’s angel, they cannot float above the events.\n\nRead: The cult classic that captures the stress of social alienation\n\nTsushima knew what it was like to grow up on the outskirts of society. She was born in 1947, the daughter of a schoolteacher and the famous novelist Osamu Dazai. Shortly after her first birthday, Dazai and another woman killed themselves together, and Tsushima was raised, alone, by her mother. Her novels tell many stories of women struggling to rear children in the face of absent fathers and oppressive social obligations. As a single mother raised by a single mother, Tsushima knew that such experiences could be grueling. Yet in some of her works, including her 1980 novel, Woman Running in the Mountains, this break with convention comes to feel liberatory, like the promise of something wild and deep that allows the body to survive the convolutions of history.\n\nWildcat Dome is considerably less optimistic. The novel was first published two years after the Fukushima disaster and near the end of Tsushima’s life. In it, the author works to expand her own experiences of fatherlessness and social isolation into a story of her country’s predicament. She deploys an array of shifting perspectives, with chapters switching among time periods and points of view—first Mitch, then Kazu, then Yonko, even Tabo’s poor and infirm mother. For these characters, life is a series of strange and unpleasant transformations over which they have little control. In Wildcat Dome, objects speak, memories take on physical form, and metamorphoses abound. The beautiful blue sky pulls Kazu off a tree branch. After his death, he speaks to Mitch in the form of an irradiated beetle. Tabo turns, in his mother’s eyes, into a cold and unfeeling stone. History is a curse, and experience a prophecy.\n\nTsushima writes in a fluid, ambiguous present tense that muddles the distance between past and present, self and other. The reader is always right there with the character, suspended in a static moment of thought or trapped within their recursive stream of consciousness, circling revelation without ever arriving there. As one character remarks, “The end of the world is here, now.” And no matter how many times the world shuffles away from ruin, there is an absence of forward movement: Though Japan has emerged from the war apparently whole and strong, Fukushima is an eerie reminder of how close devastation really is. For Mitch, Kazu, and Yonko, things always feel like that, a permanent apocalypse they cannot escape.\n\nIn this frankly astonishing novel, to survive affliction is to remain forever unmoored. Mitch attempts to reinvent himself, in and out of Japan, with little success. His wounds cannot be healed, only endured. “Though it will be a miserable life,” someone commands him, “you must live it anyway.” Like Benjamin’s angel, he will be buffeted along by time, made to face backwards toward the steadily accruing wreckage of the world. Yet in telling his story, Tsushima does what the angel cannot, calling out to awaken the dead.",

        "content": "Finn Lau thought he had escaped China’s reach when he got to London. He’d come from Hong Kong, where Chinese authorities were rapidly consolidating control. An extensive protest movement had sprung up in response, which Lau was helping to lead. But he fled after local officials arrested him at a pro-democracy demonstration in 2020. Months later, while he was walking down a quiet street in London, three masked men jumped him and beat him unconscious. Now 31, Lau still has a faint scar on his boyish face.\n\nBritish authorities called the incident a hate crime, but Lau was convinced that Beijing had sent the men to silence him. He wasn’t being paranoid: Last year, Chinese authorities declared that Lau would be “pursued for life.” They froze his remaining assets in Hong Kong and offered a bounty for information leading to his arrest. Since then, fake journalists have approached Lau seeking interviews, dozens of social-media accounts have impersonated him, and he’s received death threats. A group on Telegram posted his address in London, forcing him to move multiple times. The intimidation extended to his family members in Hong Kong. Eventually they had to flee too.\n\nLau is one of thousands who fled Hong Kong to Britain once the protests started—and particularly since June 2020, when China passed a national-security law that led to often-violent suppression. I’ve spoken with more than 30 activists like Lau who have come to the United Kingdom, where the harassment and surveillance they tried to escape has followed them. Assailants have stalked them in public and smeared them online. Letters have shown up at their neighbors’ doors promising a reward for turning over dissidents to the Chinese embassy. Back home, government authorities have suspended their retirement savings and interrogated their families. Some have been attacked.\n\nTheir stories illustrate a campaign that China is waging against dissidents across the globe. Not all of the incidents in the U.K. can be tied directly to the Chinese government, but the tactics mirror those Beijing has used to discredit and silence critics in Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States. Last month, Freedom House found that China was responsible for more recorded cases of repression beyond its borders than any other country over the past decade. The nonprofit had already concluded that the Chinese Communist Party’s war on exiles is “the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign” of its kind in the world. “This is the product of a top-down system, ordered by Xi Jinping,” Yaqiu Wang, a senior researcher at Freedom House, told me. “Whether this comes directly from Beijing or from Hong Kong, it’s ultimately a part of the CCP’s global, transnational campaign to silence anyone who is critical.”\n\nEven though China’s responsibility is an open secret, Western governments have struggled to deter the country from interfering on their soil. Xi’s crusade appears so brazen and far-reaching that it suggests he has little fear of provoking the West. By the same measure, it seems to reveal that something else really does scare him: China’s exiles.\n\nPhotograph by Emily Garthwaite Last month, demonstrators protested plans for China to relocate and expand its embassy in London.\n\nThe United Kingdom is home to the largest Hong Kong diaspora in the world. Since relinquishing its former colony in 1997, the country has admitted hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers, who represent a growing threat to China’s leaders. Thanks to globalization and social media, dissidents can organize and inspire political opposition from abroad more easily than before. That helps explain why the Hong Kong government has steadily escalated its campaign against exiles. Last year, it enacted another national-security law, called Article 23, which carries penalties that extend to activists outside the country; authorities have used it to sanction organizers overseas and revoke their passports. Many exiles told me they no longer feel safe returning to Hong Kong because they fear interrogations, imprisonment, or the confiscation of their passports. They worry that Hong Kong authorities have started importing elements of Xi’s surveillance state in order to track them abroad. Xi “feels threatened by any kind of collective action,” Wang told me—whether it originates at home or overseas.\n\nRead: Hong Kong is self-destructing\n\nSince 2019, more than 5,000 emigrants have moved to the South London borough of Sutton, where a local group organized a camp in 2023 to educate children of the Hong Kong diaspora about Chinese repression. Then the former chief executive of Hong Kong heard about it—and warned on social media that the organizers would be reported to British and Hong Kong police.\n\nAccounts of intimidation and harassment have emerged from virtually every corner of Britain where Hong Kongers have gathered. In 2019, a group of men dragged a refugee through the gates of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and assaulted him. Similar incidents have occurred in London’s Chinatown and on college campuses, including in Southampton, where Chinese students attacked Hong Kongers during a demonstration in 2023. Videos of the incident circulated on Weibo, China’s version of X, and prompted death threats against the victims.\n\nOne of the first activists I spoke with in London was Simon Cheng. The 34-year-old exile was working for the British consulate in Hong Kong when Beijing tightened its grip on the region. In 2019, he told me, Chinese officials abducted him while he was on a business trip in southern China. He said they beat him and placed him in stress positions for 15 days before forcing him to confess to allegations that he incited unrest in Hong Kong. Britain granted him asylum months later.\n\n“It was a relief, at first, to touch down in a place where there is rule of law—where I felt I could speak freely again,” Cheng told me. After settling into the city, he established a group called Hong Kongers in Britain to help new arrivals find housing and other resources. Chinese authorities took note: In 2023, the Hong Kong government offered rewards for information leading to the arrests of Cheng and 12 other overseas dissidents, six of whom lived in Britain. Officials in Hong Kong interrogated Cheng’s family, who became a focus of attention in Chinese media. “Watching my father dodge the news cameras on television sent me into a deep depression,” Cheng said. In an effort to protect his parents, Cheng encouraged them to sever ties with him. “If needed, criticize me and cut me off,” he wrote on X. “My hope is that my parents can enjoy a dignified, peaceful, and serene old age—until our next life.”\n\nPhotograph by Emily Garthwaite Simon Cheng fled Hong Kong after Chinese authorities detained him. Then they interrogated his family and offered a reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Hong Kong issued bounties on six more exiles, including Chloe Cheung, who was 19 at the time. “I came here to protect my future,” Cheung told me. She had moved to the city of Leeds with her family in 2020. “I had dreams of pursuing a career in business or finance,” she said. “The bounty has changed all of that.”\n\nShe showed me a video on her phone of a Chinese man shouting death threats at her during a protest she helped organize in November. After another demonstration, two Asian men followed her into a restaurant; she alerted the police, who opened an investigation. On Instagram and X, strangers send her sexually explicit messages written in Mandarin. Friends have asked her to stop contacting them, worried that ties to her could create problems for their relatives in Hong Kong. “It feels impossible, suddenly, to meet new people or apply for jobs,” she said. “I have no idea who I can trust.”\n\nIn October, I met another activist who’s had to cut off relationships. He asked me to use a pseudonym to protect his family, so I’ll call him Alvin. After the protests started in 2019, Alvin joined a loose network of organizers in Hong Kong who avoided direct confrontations with law enforcement but helped younger, bolder activists. Soon after he fled to London in 2020, he learned that government officials were pressing his family in China for information about him. Police had summoned some of his extended family to tea, where they unfurled printouts of Alvin’s posts on Telegram and photos of him demonstrating in London. One team of officers had traveled from mainland China to treat Alvin’s parents in Hong Kong to an extravagant dinner. The officials said he could face a lengthy prison sentence for helping “high profile” activists—a charge that could extend to his mother and father, too, unless they persuaded their son to become an informant.\n\nRead: The fracturing of Hong Kong’s democracy movement\n\nAlvin heard about the meeting months later when his mother visited him in London. “My blood went cold,” he told me. She pleaded with him through tears to stop his activism so his family could live in peace. Alvin started to distance himself from other organizers and Hong Kongers. “I never could have imagined my actions would attract so much attention from the CCP,” he told me. “I am not a frontline activist.” He repeated the words, as if to assure himself.\n\nPhotograph by Emily Garthwaite A Hong Kong activist in London says that Chinese officials have threatened his relatives back home.\n\nIn a parliamentary debate in October, Blair McDougall, a Scottish MP, said his Hong Kong constituents were frightened. Police had discovered an unauthorized Chinese outpost in the basement of a restaurant in Glasgow in 2023. British officials shut it down, along with at least three other outposts they suspected were monitoring and harassing diaspora communities.\n\nMcDougall and other lawmakers insist that similar attention should be directed toward Hong Kong’s trade office in London. Last May, U.K. authorities arrested the office’s manager along with two men he had allegedly hired to collect information for Hong Kong’s intelligence service and break into an exile’s home. The previous month, authorities had charged a British parliamentary researcher with spying. (All have pleaded not guilty except for one of the hired men, who died.) McDougall urged the British government to “review the diplomatic privileges” given to the trade office “to ensure they are not used as organs of transnational repression.”\n\nOver the summer, I joined a group of about 30 Hong Kong demonstrators who had gathered at the trade office’s front gate in Central London. Many wore dark clothing, masks, scarves, and sunglasses. As I approached, they grew uneasy and declined to comment but pointed me to two men they had seen photographing and monitoring previous protests. The activists called them “ghosts.”\n\nOne of them, a young man who was filming the demonstration, introduced himself as a part-time journalist. He wouldn’t say who employed him, but he gave me the handle of his Instagram account, which I followed. A few hours later, my friends and family told me an account that was using my name—and a photo of me—had started following them. When I mentioned this to another organizer, he showed me his phone and scrolled through more than 30 automated accounts under his name; many of them posted lies about his activism. I thought of a conversation I had with Alberto Fittarelli, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog group, who told me China has two main goals when it targets activists online: to encourage self-censorship and to “discredit the targets in the eyes of the audience hosting them.”\n\nThat strategy nearly ruined the livelihoods of two exiled painters, who go by Lumli and Lumlong. When I visited their London apartment, which doubles as their studio, it was filled with oversize canvases depicting baroque scenes from the protests in Hong Kong. For years, mysterious accounts had posted hateful comments on the Facebook page they used to sell their artwork, which Lumli and Lumlong took with them when they fled Hong Kong in 2021. (A standard post: “You dogs and rioters will all die with your family.”) Many of the profiles showed signs of fakery; they were created recently, had few followers, rarely posted, and used simplified Chinese characters typical of mainland China. Experts at Citizen Lab told me the accounts’ features are “consistent with what has been observed over the years for pro-China networks.”\n\nIn 2022, someone hacked the artists’ page and replaced their profile photo with an image of an ISIS flag, which prompted Facebook to remove them. “That account held all our important connections from the past five years. They disappeared overnight,” Lumli and Lumlong told me. “It was like a company going bankrupt.”\n\nIn early February, I attended a demonstration outside Mint Court, a stately complex in southern London that the CCP bought in 2018. Hundreds of Chinese dissidents, including Uyghurs and Tibetans, had traveled from across the U.K. to protest Beijing’s plan to move its embassy there, which would entail a massive expansion relative to its current location in Central London. The demonstration came as the U.S. cut funding for groups that track the persecution of Chinese dissidents.\n\nRead: America can’t just unpause USAID\n\nBritish officials at the protest echoed fears among the activists that the CCP would use the new embassy to carry out surveillance. “We know that courageous activists have been silenced, others have been followed, more have been intimidated,” Tom Tugendhat, a former security minister the Chinese government has sanctioned, told the protesters. “We will not tolerate the CCP doing to you here what they tried to do in China.”\n\nPhotograph by Emily Garthwaite A poster painted by the Hong Kong exiles Lumli and Lumlong\n\nA few feet from the speakers, Lumli and Lumlong displayed a hand-painted poster of Jimmy Lai, a newspaper publisher and British national who’s serving a prison sentence in Hong Kong for supporting the democracy movement. Cheng, the head of Hong Kongers in Britain, maneuvered to the front of the crowd to deliver a speech. “This proposed embassy is not just a diplomatic site,” he said. “It is a statement of abusive power over human rights—a glorified monument for the CCP’s diplomats.”\n\nA few weeks earlier, Cheng had learned that the U.K.’s housing ministry, which had provided money for his advocacy group, had decided to scale back its support. He had spent the past weeks frantically applying for new jobs so he could avoid getting evicted from his apartment. He also told me that someone had infiltrated his group of friends and spread lies to turn them against him. For a time, several cut him off. “It felt like someone sent an invisible virus, designed to attack my sense of security—and my spirit.”\n\nHis anxiety has taken the form of recurring nightmares. In one of his dreams, he is back at his parents’ house in Hong Kong, but they aren’t home. The kitchen is in disarray. A strange woman assures Cheng that his parents left to buy groceries, but Cheng then realizes that she is an undercover officer. His parents have been taken to prison.\n\n“When I wake up, I am relieved at first. I remember I am safe. I am worlds away. My parents are unharmed.” The feeling doesn’t last long before it’s eclipsed by a harder reality. “I am overcome with grief for those spaces and faces I may never see again.”",

I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows debate over the president’s views ahead of the attack.\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows reactions to the strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nRead: A conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg about his extraordinary scoop\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe Trump administration has provided many jaw-dropping moments, but few have been as shocking as editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg’s scoop published today. Goldberg reported on how he was inadvertently added to a discussion of a military strike on Houthi militias in Yemen, conducted over the encrypted messaging app Signal. In essence, a reporter was invited to listen while the nation’s top security officials weighed and debated a military action, and was sent detailed information about the strike.\n\nEven President Donald Trump seemed unaware of the breach. “You’re saying that they had what?” he replied when asked about the news. Trump added that he is “not a big fan of The Atlantic,” something he’s previously made clear, and which makes the unintentional leak all the more remarkable. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said, “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”\n\nI called Goldberg this afternoon to learn more about how the story came about and what the disclosure reveals about the Trump administration. This interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Has anything like this ever happened to you before?\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: I think that on one level, this is very relatable. Everyone has sent a text or an email to an unintended recipient, and sometimes they’ve embarrassed themselves by doing that. This is, I would say, at a different level—but it kind of proves a point, which is that there’s a reason people who work on sensitive issues in the government aren’t supposed to use Signal, even though it is end-to-end encrypted. Anyone can use Signal, so if you’re not careful, you might pull into your conversation a Houthi sympathizer or a magazine editor.\n\nOur colleague Shane Harris points out that the phones of top senior defense and national-security and intelligence officials are targets of intelligence operations. Imagine what you can do if you saw everything that the CIA director may be texting, even on a secure phone—especially on a secure phone. I’m mindful of the fact that the Trump team has already dealt with a serious issue in the securing of sensitive documents in Mar-a-Lago. If you’re going to make a big deal about Hillary Clinton’s emails, you may want to have excellent communication hygiene.\n\nDavid: Tell me how you came to conclude that this group was real.\n\nJeffrey: It was actually chilling: 11:44 a.m., Saturday the 15th, eastern time, in my car in a parking lot, just checking my phone, and I see a text from Pete Hegseth, or somebody who’s hoaxing me as Pete Hegseth. It provides information about upcoming military operations with timings attached: This is going to happen. Then this happens, then this happens, and this happens. I’m sitting there in my car and thinking I’m about to find out if this was an elaborate scam or not. So I thought to myself, I’m sitting here for the next two hours with my hands around my phone. I check on X around 1:55, and yes, Sanaa is being bombed, so then I have the realization that this is almost certainly a real channel and not just an elaborate fakery of some sort. And that’s when I began to realize that I had to write about this massive security breach.\n\nDavid: You have done a lot of sensitive national-security reporting. Have you ever received any information like this?\n\nJeffrey: No, nothing like this. This was like an intravenous drip of information that no one in the government thinks journalists should have. Until almost the very last minute, I could not believe that this was actually happening, that there could be a Mack-truck-size breach, that somehow, the editor in chief of The Atlantic was invited into a conversation with the intelligence agencies, secretaries, the national security adviser. Like most reporters, I’ve been a recipient of leaks. A leak is a totally different thing. That’s a whistleblower trying to make complaints. This is just reckless.\n\nDavid: There’s the horror that something like this would happen on an operational level, but in terms of what we learn from the substance of the conversation, what are the most important things that people should take away?\n\nJeffrey: The actual conversation that they have is fascinating, and in a certain way impressive. It’s nice to see that they’re disagreeing with one another. It’s very useful for the public to know that the vice president has a more hands-off approach than other members of the administration. One of the things that I found interesting was that when a person named “S M” in the chat, who I took to be Stephen Miller, comes in and says, “As I heard it, the president was clear,” this kind of shuts down the conversation. It suggests that Stephen Miller can be in a conversation with, among others, the vice president of the United States and still can get his way. (Miller did not reply to a request for comment or confirm that he is “S M.”)\n\nDavid: In addition to the question of how secure Signal is, this is also notable, because without this report, none of these conversations might be preserved for posterity. You note that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz set some messages to disappear after a week or so.\n\nJeffrey: This is an interesting question: Are they using Signal because it’s convenient? Are they using Signal because it disappears? According to the experts Shane interviewed, the administration should not have established a Signal thread for such conversations in the first place, but once it did, what one is supposed to do legally is copy an official government account, and that government account will then send these threads to the National Archives for posterity, for research, for accountability. But if you’re using a disappearing-text app, I don’t know. That’s one of the questions that I’ve asked and have not gotten answered yet.\n\nDavid: It is remarkable that this would happen with any reporter. It’s even more remarkable that this would happen with someone like you, and with a publication that has been specifically singled out by the president. Do you have any sense of how this happened?\n\nJeffrey: I literally have no idea. The remarkable thing is that no one in the group asked, Who’s JG?, and when I removed myself from the group, seemingly nobody said, Hey, why did JG leave?\n\nDavid: Are you concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration because of this story?\n\nJeffrey: It’s not my role to care about the possibility of threats or retaliation. We just have to come to work and do our jobs to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, in our society today—we see this across corporate journalism and law firms and other industries—there’s too much preemptive obeying for my taste. All we can do is just go do our jobs.\n\nRead the full article here.",

        "title": "Why Everyone Thinks Their Government Has Failed",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Incumbency was once a powerful electoral advantage: A sitting leader could cement bonds with constituents and donors that translated into support at the ballot box. But last year, wielding power was evidently a drag on leaders’ popularity, for reasons apparently not rooted in the specifics of the politics of their countries. In 2024, incumbent parties and their candidates lost ground virtually everywhere, whether they were right-wing or left-wing, moderate or radical, competent or incompetent, rich or poor.\n\nVoters all over the world felt that their ruling parties weren’t delivering for them in 2024. How could they all be wrong? But if their governments span the gamut of policies and values, how could they all be right?\n\nThe phenomenon seemingly coincided with the global rise of what I’ve elsewhere called the “three Ps”: populism, polarization, and post-truth. These trends offer a clue, but whether they are the cause or the effect of the turn on incumbents is not a simple question.\n\nSomething has happened either to voters’ expectations or to governments’ capacity to deliver on them, or both.\n\nEvidence of the trend is inescapable. Just in the past year, Labour routed the ruling British Conservatives by a historic margin, and France’s centrist President Emmanuel Macron saw his authority weakened by the inconclusive result of a snap election. In Japan, the ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed almost continuously since 1955, lost its parliamentary majority in the powerful lower house. In South Africa, the African National Congress lost its absolute majority for the first time since the end of apartheid. In South Korea, President Yoon Suk Yeol’s party lost midterm elections by a landslide. The party of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to gain a majority for the first time since 2014. In Argentina, in the fall of 2023, the ruling Peronist coalition lost to the libertarian outsider Javier Milei.\n\nIncumbents lost ground in elections in Panama, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria, Czechia, Slovakia, and Lithuania. Among democracies, one of very few countries to have bucked the trend is Mexico, where an overwhelmingly popular incumbent populist managed to hand the presidency to a handpicked successor. Everywhere else, incumbency seems to have become the electoral kiss of death.\n\nWe don’t know why the repudiation of incumbents has been so fierce and so pervasive. In some countries, unemployment, inflation, or both drove a backlash. In others, widespread corruption had produced mass protests. In India and Brazil, racial and religious strife have weighed heavily in electoral politics. In a globalized world, perhaps governments are not willing or able to nimbly meet demands to address domestic inequality, say, or to restructure their countries’ economies inside an electoral term. In an algorithm-fueled media environment with ever less editorial curation, perhaps conspiracy theories and demonization of one’s political opponents more easily catch fire.\n\nDerek Thompson: The new law of electoral politics\n\nOr maybe the expectations of the global public have ceased to track with any realistic idea of government capacity. Contemplating the recent anti-incumbent turn, I have found myself returning to a conversation I had a while back with Ricardo Lagos, who was the president of Chile from 2000 to 2006. He told me that while in office, he had wooed a dissatisfied constituency by channeling substantial resources to a poor neighborhood in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile’s capital. “We built a housing complex and made sure that public services like water, electricity, and health were available and reliable,” he told me. And yet, when election time rolled around, the voters of that neighborhood turned away from Lagos and supported the opposition.\n\n“I was flabbergasted,” he told me, “and decided to find out for myself what had happened. I met with a group of community leaders and was expressing my surprise and singling out the hundreds of houses we built when one of the neighbors told me, ‘Yes, Mr. President, we know what you did, but this is all about parking spaces. The houses are nice, but we don’t have any parking.’”\n\nLagos was stunned. Public housing in Chile had never included such middle-class trappings as parking. But his constituents were getting wealthier, and as they did, their expectations ran ahead of his government’s ability to deliver. This problem is not Chile’s alone. In many countries, expectations rise faster than government capacity, governments look hapless, and the resulting public discontent makes the countries harder to govern.\n\nWe can call this cycle the “Lagos paradox.” It has a long history, but I suspect that the geographical scope, social potency, and political impact of the Lagos paradox may have now assumed dimensions incomparable to any time in the past. Perhaps a global expectations gap has opened, destabilizing politics and giving rise to its toxic offspring, anti-politics.\n\nThe idea—that political instability is inevitable when people’s expectations rise beyond their government’s capacity to meet them—is not new. Samuel Huntington explored it in his 1968 book, Political Order in Changing Societies. The developing countries of the era were unstable, he wrote, because emergent middle classes demanded improvements to material conditions and public services faster than the economies and institutions of these countries could deliver them. Waves of discontent pummeled political leaders who were powerless to quell them.\n\nBut Huntington was trying to account for the third-world basket cases of his time—poor countries whose restive masses kept their governments constantly off-balance. He took for granted that the most advanced, consolidated democracies wouldn’t have this problem because well-off voters could afford to be patient and understood what could be delivered. What if the expectations gap has now come for the rich countries that Huntington once presumed immune? The result would be that incumbents would lag, populists would surge, and democratic institutions would totter.\n\nThe global scope of this turn of events might provide an important clue as to its provenance. Normally, the paradox sets in under one of three conditions: People’s hopes start rising faster than before, governments lag behind in fulfilling expectations, or both things happen at once. It’s hard to think of a global reason governments should all be getting worse at delivering prosperity or better public services at the same time. Some analysts suggest that a spurt of pandemic-induced inflation did precisely that. But focusing on the growth of expectations seems more natural, simply because the information space in which expectations are formed and expressed has so obviously and visibly transformed in recent decades.\n\nSocial-media platforms allow people to see more readily than in the past how others—or idealized versions of others—live. The effects have been documented widely in the context of mental health, which can suffer from a constant barrage of images of people living glamorous, picture-perfect lives. But these images may also exact a political cost. Social media keeps us constantly informed of who has it better, and of the aspirations that elude us but that others have fulfilled. At the same time, the disappointed vent frustrations on these digital platforms, where they can easily see how many others have also had their expectations dashed. Whether or not people are becoming more upset about unfulfilled expectations, new communications technologies could be making their frustrations more visible and politically potent.\n\nMartin Gurri argued essentially this in his influential 2014 book, The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium. He observed that the political tensions that tend to result from social media don’t typically fall along a left-right axis but between center and periphery, setting previously marginal groups against established institutions. Writing around the time of the Arab Spring, Gurri emphasized how the new technologies allowed citizens to challenge traditional centers of authority.\n\nWhat he did not foresee was that the accessibility of social media—its lowering of the barriers to entry and democratization of the information space—could also be exploited by power-hungry populists. These leaders have used the new technologies to sharpen discontent and turn it on an elite that they urge their followers to blame for everything. Disappointed by the rate at which their lives are improving, eyes newly opened to how many others share their disappointment, and flush with explanations that lay the blame on institutions of authority, people in rich and poor countries alike may experience the Lagos paradox.\n\nPublic sectors the world over may be structurally unable to fulfill voters’ expectations, not necessarily because government-service provision is bad (though in many cases it is bad) but because the growth of expectations could well have escaped the capacities of governments to keep up. In the United States, dissatisfaction with government, whether or not fueled by social media, has been a long and damaging trend, as documented in a 2024 national survey conducted by the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nListen: Does democracy even work?\n\nBureaucracies incubated in the 19th century and developed in the 20th move slowly—and adapt to new demands glacially—in the best of times. In many countries, rules and regulations have accrued in layers, stifling the administrative state’s ability to react swiftly to new conditions. And the demographic realities of falling birth rates and aging populations basically everywhere create new headwinds for public-service provision: Public sectors need to do more and more (and spend more and more) just to keep service provision at the levels of yesteryear.\n\nMeasuring expectations is difficult—they are amorphous, necessarily self-reported, and rarely surveyed. But if they were indeed skyrocketing, and service provision barely budging, the picture for incumbents would be as grim as the one we saw in 2024. Leaders of all stripes may be scrambling to provide services that their constituents will consider even adequate, let alone good. That the anti-incumbent mood will turn on the populists it helped get elected is reasonable to expect.\n\nThe world of gate-kept media that filters extreme views and moderates discontent is gone for good. Everybody-to-everybody communications are a permanent feature of modern societies. And although public-sector reforms could make some difference on the margin to help bureaucracies do their jobs better, governments will not likely overcome runaway expectations driven by the new information age.\n\nFor a glimpse of the future, consider Italy, which is now in its fourth decade of leadership by ever more extreme outsiders. The country followed the outlandish rule of the billionaire playboy Silvio Berlusconi—complete with “bunga bunga” parties and rampant self-dealing—with the even stranger anti-politicians of the uncategorizable, post-everything Five Star Movement, then kept looking farther to the fringe until it landed on Giorgia Meloni, a hyper-conservative populist with ideological roots in Italy’s fascist movement. These experiments, interspersed with short spells in power for the more conventional parties of the center-left, show an electorate drawn to stronger and stronger versions of outsider posturing and populist extremism. One thing it surely doesn’t want is an incumbent.",

        "content": "Abigail Hawkes earnestly dreams of disappearing. The teenage protagonist of Emily St. James’s new novel, Woodworking, can’t wait for the day when she can slip out of Mitchell, South Dakota, and make it to a big city like Chicago; once there, she imagines, she’ll shed her past and start over, and no one will know she’s transgender. Abigail has seen this vanishing act referred to as “woodworking” on the internet—picking up stakes, passing for cis, and fading into the woodwork. For now, Abigail is a pariah in her town and her school, facing discrimination both inane (locker vandalism, unsympathetic teachers) and terrifying (physical threats, a targeted bathroom ban). She’s been kicked out of her family home and is living with her sister. It was “a whole thing,” she says in a moment of profound understatement—a situation “so ridiculous” that she laughed in the face of her violent father. Yet beneath her adolescent bravado, she’s so unhappy that she’s willing to jettison her entire life thus far to get away from prejudice.\n\nThe anonymous woman who brought up woodworking online was warning readers like Abigail against it: “It destroys you. You can’t pretend you’re not who you are.” Abigail isn’t moved by this argument. She is open about being trans only because she’s been forced to be; she sees her public transition simply as a necessary first step toward the life she wants. But, as she quickly learns, no one gets to just come out once and be done with the whole mess. Many LGBTQ people face a lifetime of moments that require them to weigh honesty against safety—and transgender Americans are especially vulnerable in 2025, under an administration that has declared they don’t exist and demanded their disappearance from the military, schools, bathrooms, and public life writ large. Woodworking is set in the fall of 2016, just before Donald Trump’s first presidential victory, but its concerns are extremely of the moment. Yet the novel doesn’t feel prescriptive, because St. James explores momentous personal decisions dramatically rather than dogmatically, making clear through a variety of perspectives that there are no obvious choices—only trade-offs.\n\nQueer life is often described with the binary metaphor of the closet: You’re in or you’re out, your identity hidden or declared. But that’s insufficient for many people, including Abigail. She’s already sacrificed security, rejecting her parents’ offer to take her back in as long as she pretends to be their son again. She won’t renounce her gender—but she’s all right with the idea of keeping her history secret. In Woodworking, St. James demolishes the simplistic closet concept, revealing lives that are marked by many transitions, and that pass through any number of gradations within the continuum of showing up, hiding, slipping under the radar, or openly demanding respect. Abigail will soon learn she’s not the only trans woman in Mitchell—and that the people around her will each decide on a different path.\n\nWoodworking By Emily St James\n\nThe first person we meet is not Abigail but an English teacher who supervises Abigail’s time in detention (for calling her classmates “fascist cunts”). Everyone knows this teacher as the jovial, mustached Mr. Skyberg, whose first name appears in the novel only as a blank gray box. But the teacher quickly reveals something to the student that no one else on Earth knows: Skyberg is trans, too, and her chosen name is Erica. Erica is struggling: She’s divorced, in large part because she emotionally retreated from her ex-wife, Constance. Her only maybe-friend is her community-theater buddy Brooke Daniels, a member of Mitchell’s most powerful conservative Christian family. Erica believes it’s too late to transition and live as a woman, and definitely too late to woodwork. From her moderately safe hiding place, she feels as though she sees the world through a thick film (an effect St. James amplifies by narrating Erica’s chapters in the third person and Abigail’s in the first). Erica’s old name sounds “enveloped in fog” whenever someone says it aloud to her.\n\nAdam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won’t end there\n\nAnd yet she shares herself with Abigail because the thrill of being seen is intoxicating. Abigail claims to be put off by Erica’s sudden confession, but she is also genuinely glad to no longer be alone. The two form a strange, cross-generational friendship. The teacher has more life experience, but Abigail becomes, at 17, her mentor and mother figure, bringing Erica to a trans support group and complimenting the nail polish she’s been brave enough to wear in public. They discuss Erica’s work on a local production of Our Town that stars Constance, which is drawing the exes together. They talk about Abigail’s romance with Caleb Daniels, Brooke’s son, who initially hides their relationship out of shame and fear.\n\nBut by the middle of the novel, an unresolvable tension arises between Abigail and Erica. The former feels unsupported by her friend, left to weather transphobia on her own when someone else could be standing beside her. And Erica deeply envies Abigail’s open future, when her own feels so foreclosed. She is terrified that someone’s going to figure out her secret, and maintaining it requires more than silence: She knows that insufficiently masculine behavior courts rumors and harassment, and she has to actively pretend to be a different person to protect her relationships, her job, and her safety. Eventually, she panics, overwhelmed by the hazards ahead of her. “She had given it a try, and it had gone poorly, and now she was going to give up,” Erica thinks, looking at herself in the mirror. “There was power in knowing the obvious and choosing to ignore it.” She slams the door of self-knowledge behind her, losing Abigail’s friendship as she does.\n\nSt. James makes both choices seem reasonable, but irreconcilable—only to break the stalemate with a late revelation. Another woman in their town is also trans, but she woodworked years ago, and made decisions very different from either of theirs. She’s wedged so deeply into her conservative milieu that she now supports anti-trans candidates and causes. She has traded authenticity for stability, given up her old family for a new one, and made an uneasy peace with her own hypocrisy. Where another novel might conclude with either her downfall or her redemption, Woodworking chooses neither. Instead, the woman is left to live with the life she’s made, just as she has every day for decades.\n\nDespite the precariousness of coming out, only one path really feels viable for the two main characters. Abigail realizes she can’t leave other trans women behind: “We’re all we’ve got,” she recognizes. “We have to take care of each other.” And Erica decides she must find a way to live, not just survive. One crucial scene midway through the story illustrates the pressure that’s been building up inside her and the benefit of letting it out. After deciding to deny her transness (which in turn alienates Abigail), Erica is miserable and exhausted. Remembering other people in her life who were punished for stepping outside gendered boxes, she weeps at the ways she’s contorted herself in order to stay locked inside her own. Then she sees Constance, and in a desperate flash, the words tumble out of her.\n\nRead: How gay culture helped everyone come out of the closet\n\nWhy only then, years after they first met, after college, after their marriage and divorce, does Erica share her secret? Because she is done running, St. James suggests; because she wants to be seen the way Abigail is seen, at least by the person who’s come closest to knowing her. After that moment, Erica isn’t “out”—she’ll still need to tell her boss, her family, and her neighbors, or else let the rumor mill do its work. She’ll want to change her hair, her clothes, her grooming; she’ll have to deal with the guesses and questions of strangers; people will likely misgender her or misunderstand her, and they have the potential to do much worse. But during this quick, unrehearsed grasp at connection, readers see clearly why the rewards of that recognition are far higher than its cost.",

        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nIt’s happened to the best of us. We mistakenly send a text about a colleague we are mad at to that very colleague. We accidentally include our mom on the sibling text chain about our mom. Today on Radio Atlantic, a much higher-stakes texting error: The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, received a connection request on Signal from a “Michael Waltz,” which is the name of President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. Two days later, he was added to a group text with top administration officials created for the purpose of coordinating high-level national-security conversations about the Houthis in Yemen. On March 15, Goldberg sat in his car in a grocery-store parking lot waiting to see if the strike would actually happen. The bombs fell. The text thread had to be real.\n\nWe talk with Goldberg about this absurd chain of events, and with Shane Harris, who covers national security for The Atlantic, about what it means that defense officials were discussing detailed war plans on a text chain.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nHanna Rosin: On March 15, the U.S. began a bombing campaign against Houthi groups in Yemen. A couple of hours before that, our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, sat in his car in a supermarket parking lot, waiting to see if and when the attack would start. How he knew about this military campaign is a very weird story. Not long ago, Jeff was added to a text chain of very important people in the administration. Presumably, he was added to it by accident.\n\nI know, it happens to the best of us—but there was the editor of The Atlantic monitoring the back-and-forth between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J. D. Vance, and others, wondering: Could this possibly be real? In fact, Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, later confirmed that it was indeed all real. I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic, and today, we have on the show editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg and staff writer Shane Harris, who covers national security, to explain what happened and what it might mean.\n\nJeff, welcome to the show.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: Hey, Hanna.\n\nRosin: Hi, Shane.\n\nShane Harris: Hi.\n\nRosin: Jeff, on Tuesday, March 11, you get a Signal message from a user identified as Michael Waltz, which is also the name of President Trump’s national security adviser. Where are you when you get this message, and what are you thinking?\n\nGoldberg: Weirdly and randomly, I was in Salzburg, Austria, and what I’m thinking is not much, because in my line of work, that wouldn’t be the craziest thing to happen.\n\nRosin: Like, it could be him; it could be someone pretending to be him. You’re not that fussed.\n\nGoldberg: Well, I am always cautious about people reaching out across social media or messaging apps.\n\nI don’t assume that they’re the person that the name suggests, but I would have to say that I was glad, also, and I was hoping that it was the actual Michael Waltz, because I’d like to be in regular contact with Michael Waltz for all the obvious journalistic reasons.\n\nRosin: Right. So you’re like, Oh, maybe he has a scoop for me.\n\nGoldberg: Yeah.\n\nRosin: Okay, so then what happens next? You’re going about your life, going about your business, and …\n\nGoldberg: And then I get added to a group, a Signal group—you know, a text-messaging chat group—called “Houthi PC small group.” PC I know from covering White House issues, you know: “Principals Committee,” basically the top leaders of Cabinet departments generally associated with national-security issues, and then a message from Mike Waltz talking about how he’s putting together this PC small group to talk about the Houthis, because something’s gonna be happening over the next 72 hours. That’s when I sort of think—I mean, honestly, the first thing I thought was: I’m really being spoofed. Like, somebody is—this is a hoax. This is a state or nonstate actor, probably nonstate actor, looking to entrap, embarrass, whatever word you wanna use, a journalist.\n\nRosin: Right. So you’re on alert. Like, it’s a little bit interesting, but also …\n\nGoldberg: Hanna, as you know, I’m always on alert.\n\nRosin: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.\n\nGoldberg: Hanna, what am I gonna tell you?\n\nRosin: All right, so then, so maybe it’s a spoof, maybe it’s not. How does it start to get more real?\n\nGoldberg: Well, it gets real in the sense that if somebody’s doing a spoof, it’s a very, very accurate spoof. What happens is, a number of Cabinet-level officials start reporting into this chain, giving the names of their deputies or contact people over the weekend, when, clearly, something’s gonna happen in Yemen. Uh, in retrospect, clearly something’s gonna happen in Yemen. And that was that for that day; it was the next day that they start engaging in a policy discussion really in earnest. And it’s, you know, explicated in the story that I wrote. But, um, that’s when I’m sort of thinking to myself, If this is a simulation or this is a fake, someone’s going to a huge, huge length to make it seem real, because everybody in the chat sounds like the person who they’re quote-unquote playing. So I don’t say I’m 50–50; I’m still 60, 70, you know, 70–30 this is a fakery, because, for the simple reason that this is nuts—I mean, obviously why, why would I be involved in this?\n\nRosin: I wouldn’t even know what to think, because yeah, like, we include people on text chains who we shouldn’t. Like, the mistake seems as implausible as the reality—like, every version seems implausible.\n\nGoldberg: We all make the mistake. This is why this is so relatable. Yeah. We all … I’m thinking of Shane, and I’m writing to Hanna about Shane—an assignment, or how great Shane is. And I type in Shane into the recipient, because that’s the name that’s on my mind.\n\nI don’t know what was going on in Mike Waltz’s mind, who he was thinking of—we’re trying to figure that out, still trying to figure that out. But in any case, I was added to this group, and it’s a misdirected email or text chain that I shouldn’t have been on. But the larger point—and obviously Shane can speak to this—the larger point is that: Why is this conversation happening out in the open? Now, I know Signal is end-to-end encrypted, but it’s a commercial texting service that anyone, not just people with security clearances in the federal government, can join.\n\nSo, so, and that’s the essential danger, and that’s, if you want to think about it, an original sin. The original sin is communicating very sensitive information in a channel where you can mistakenly bring in—I mean, forget the editor of The Atlantic. You could have brought in a Houthi, for all you know. You could bring in somebody who is actively sympathetic to the Houthis and sharing real-time information with you. That’s somewhat appalling.\n\nRosin: So, Shane, I’m gonna ask you about that in a second, but I need one more part of the story before we move on to that. Give me an example of—you said it sounded like them. Like, if it was a simulation, it was an amazing simulation. Can you give us an example?\n\nGoldberg: Sure: Pete Hegseth writing an all-caps about how he finds the Europeans pathetic. J. D. Vance sounding like a kind of quasi-isolationist, talking about: Why would we do this sort of thing? Europe doesn’t—Europe should take care of this problem; it’s not our problem. Trade conversations. The most interesting one, and the one that I thought, Whoa, that really does sound like the guy: At the end of this chain, Stephen Miller, or I should say “S M,” a person identified as “S M,” comes in and basically shuts the conversation down and said, I heard the president. He was clear to me; he wants to do this. It was basically—and obviously this is really interesting—it’s a conversation with not only the secretaries of state, treasury, and defense, but the vice president of the United States, and here comes Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff, ostensibly just deputy chief of staff, coming in and saying, Uh, everybody, uh, the president spoke. I heard it. Y’all need to just stop doing what you’re doing. And then everybody kind of gets in line and, like: All right, well I guess we’re attacking Yemen.\n\nRosin: It’s so crazy that you’re just watching this conversation unfold.\n\nGoldberg: Look, the White House has confirmed that this is an authentic chain, but we’re still trying to figure out some aspects of it. I still don’t know the identities of one or two people, because they had their initials. So when we talk about them, I’m assuming that “S M” is Stephen Miller, but I’m not guaranteeing that to you.\n\nThat’s a good example of one person. On the other hand, obviously, the one called “Hegseth” is Hegseth.\n\nRosin: So you heard Vance disagree with the president, which almost never happens publicly. That’s interesting.\n\nGoldberg: I mean, to be fair to all vice presidents and presidents, it never happens in any administration, where a vice president is gonna go out and, I mean, of course he didn’t go out here. He thought he was—actually, it’s really, it’s interesting, because Vance is saying in the conversation: I don’t think the president understands the ramifications of what he’s doing. He’s saying that to people who work for the president. It’s kind of a bold move, to say: Trump doesn’t understand what’s going on. And now if I’m just sort of—this is just speculation—but if I’m Stephen Miller, and I’m reading that, and I’m the enforcer, I’m like: Okay, thanks, J. D. That’ll be enough of that.\n\nRosin: Right, right, right, right, right. So some of the things are, like, overheard across the bathroom stall—you don’t hear them in public. Other things are, like, exactly as you expect.\n\nGoldberg: Right, right, right. Other things are exactly as I expect. I mean, even later in the story, when, after the first successful strike on the Houthis in Yemen—\n\nRosin: And that’s when you know this was real.\n\nGoldberg: Well, then I know it’s real, because I was told beforehand that it was gonna happen, in my phone, and then two hours later it happens.\n\nThat’s pretty good proof that, you know, if somebody is spoofing this, then it’s not some media-gadfly organization. It’s a foreign intelligence service that had knowledge of the U.S. strikes—seems implausible. But then the part that really struck me as very Trump administration was the sharing of all these emojis: flag emojis, muscle emojis, fire emojis.\n\nRosin: Prayer emoji.\n\nGoldberg: Prayer emoji, which, you know, and it’s like, by the way, I mean, it was—talk about relatable. It’s like every workplace—I mean, this is what I actually thought when I’m seeing this come over the phone, is Wow, every workplace is the same. It’s like, Big victory! We got the new, you know, the Dunder Mifflin contract, and, you know, muscle emoji, and it’s like, here was, you know, We took out some Houthis! Good, good, good work, everybody. So that’s when I thought, Wow, these guys are—these could be these guys. Because if I were trying to spoof them, I wouldn’t do something so implausible as to start inserting juvenile emojis into a national-security conversation.\n\nRosin: Unless you were so good.\n\nGoldberg: Yeah, no, if I had outfoxed myself, you know. I wouldn’t have done that if I were doing a simulation.\n\nRosin: One more question about your reality: As all this is happening and you’re starting to realize this might be real, are you talking to people about it? Are you in your own reality about it? Are you, like, where are you?\n\nGoldberg: Well, I’m talking to certain colleagues, including and especially Shane, who’s sitting next to me. Shane, who’s been covering the intelligence community for a long while. And, you know, I’m talking to him from the beginning about this, ’cause I do need some reverb, some reaction to it, ’cause it’s never, I’ve never seen this kind of thing or heard of something like this happening.\n\nBut when I first showed him just the initial foray—you know, the “we’re having a group”—Shane was like, No, no. Somebody’s trying to—this is an operation. I don’t know who it is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, but this is an op. This is a disinformation operation, because these guys don’t do that.\n\nRosin: Okay, Shane: “These guys don’t do that.” Why was that your first thought? What don’t they do?\n\nHarris: I mean, what they do is talk about who we’re gonna bomb and why should we bomb them. They don’t do it on Signal. And, I mean, in the initial presentation of this that Jeff gave to me, I thought: Well, this, this sounds crazy. Why would they be that reckless? Why would the national security adviser set up a group, call it, you know, PC Houthi group, and then start adding these people?\n\nAnd it was actually kind of baffling, too, because, again, if this was a hoax, somebody was going to really great lengths to do it—which could happen.\n\nGoldberg: I mean, you know, sophisticated operations do happen in the intelligence world.\n\nHarris: Then the question was, of course: Why? To what end? So where is this going? And then as it went on, I think it became, like, as Jeff said, increasingly clear that the needle was moving quickly towards authentic. But my initial reaction as to why it was probably not real was: I couldn’t imagine senior national-security officials deciding that it was a good idea to discuss something of this sensitivity where, let’s be clear, pilots are in the air, they could be shot down, people could be killed, people are going to be killed on the ground—things are happening very fast. Why would you not do that in the Situation Room or in a secure facility? Many of these Cabinet officials, by the way, have facilities like that in their house. They can go have those conversations.\n\nGoldberg: Most of the relevant ones, the heads of intelligence agencies, the, obviously, defense secretary and the like, they have plenty of ways to communicate with each other within a minute or two of needing to.\n\nRosin: Even though Signal’s encrypted?\n\nHarris: Yeah. So the problem is this. There’s a couple problems. One, it’s encrypted, but it’s never been approved by the government for sharing classified or what’s called national-defense information. Now, to be clear, we talked to former security officials, former U.S. officials, who said, Yeah, we did use Signal in the government. We might use it to transmit sort of, um, certainly unclassified, not sensitive information. We might talk around something or, like, notify someone that you’re leaving a particular country. But this level of specificity—actual planning for an ongoing operation, the sharing of intelligence and information about strikes—that is clearly not what Signal’s intended for.\n\nIt’s very convenient, and it is relatively safe. I mean, I know, like, some officials who’ve traveled overseas in conflict zones who use it because they’re not near a U.S. embassy, let’s say, but it’s not meant for this kind of detailed planning which occurs as, you know, Mr. Waltz said, at the principals-committee level—that is done in the Situation Room, or that’s done at their various, you know, buildings where these people work.\n\nRosin: Just so I’m clear, what level of detail crosses the line? I know you don’t wanna say what they actually said about the campaign, but what kinds of details when you saw them were like: That would never happen.\n\nHarris: So details like the number of aircraft that are involved, the kinds of munitions that are being dropped, specific times—\n\nRosin: That was on the chain?\n\nHarris: Specific targets on the ground, um, you know, intelligence-related matters relating to the strike and to the targets, names of individuals—of U.S. officials—who should not have been put in an unclassified chain because of their status as intelligence officers. You know, you can kind of, like, you can—there’s probably six or seven different kinds of information that are arguably implicated under the rules and the law for how you’re supposed to handle this stuff.\n\nGoldberg: By the way, a lot of it is just common sense. I mean, you read something, and you could tell the difference between strategic information and tactical information. We should deal with the Houthis—fine, right? We should deal—we should do X, Y, and Z, because the Houthis are a threat to commerce and American national-security interests.\n\nThis is what we’re gonna do to the Houthis in two hours is not information that the public should have. I mean, even as a reporter I say that, and, like, I’m fascinated. I want to know how they’re making decisions, why they’re making decisions. I wanna know after action why things happened, why they went right, why they went wrong, and so on.\n\nBut I don’t want—and I’ve been doing this for a while, as has Shane—I don’t want information before a kinetic action, before a strike of some sort that has to do with the practical aspects of that strike, information that if it got into the wrong hands could actually endanger the lives of Americans.\n\nI mean, the north star for me and Shane and most normal people, normal reporters, is: Look, we don’t want to endanger the lives of American personnel in the field. And that’s why this was—that’s why the Saturday texting, the Saturday chain, was very, very different than the Friday: because it got very practical.\n\nRosin: When was the bombing campaign?\n\nGoldberg: Saturday the 15th. The first bombs exploded in Yemen around 1:45 p.m. eastern time. I found out at 11:44 eastern time that it was happening.\n\nRosin: Got it. So just so I understand, it’s like, they’re revealing specificity of plans which are about to take place, which could put lives in danger, yes?\n\nGoldberg: Okay, like, so here’s the thing that crossed my mind all throughout this, which is: Imagine if it weren’t me in that chain. But imagine if it were somebody—I mean, this sounds implausible, but it’s also implausible to include me in the chain—imagine it was somebody who was a Houthi.\n\nHarris: Or an Iranian diplomat.\n\nGoldberg: Or an Iranian diplomat, or a diplomat from another country who was a side deal with the Iranians. They literally would’ve known when things were going to happen.\n\nRosin: But I have to say: A journalist is no less dangerous. ’Cause you could have published those plans. So you’re not the best choice either.\n\nGoldberg: Um, well, I, I’m the—yes.\n\nRosin: Of journalists, you’re an excellent choice.\n\nHarris: I mean, a less scrupulous one—\n\nRosin: But a less scrupulous journalist.\n\nGoldberg: No, no, I mean, and I’m sure there are journalists who disagree with my view, who take a kind of, I would call it nihilistic view, which is, like: Information is information; we should just put it all out there.\n\nRosin: Right.\n\nGoldberg: And damn the torpedoes. I’m not—that’s not my thing.\n\nHarris: There’s another reason why this was so dangerous that doesn’t have, doesn’t involve mistakenly adding a journalist to the thread. And that is that while Signal—I mean, you said it’s end-to-end encrypted; it’s very good and secure that way. That’s true. But the device that it’s on, right, is your phone. And while the iOS system is pretty good, nation-states—and here I’m talking about China in particular, which, remember, is behind a recent, you know, penetration of the telecom networks called Salt Typhoon—the phone in the pocket of every one of those national-security officials must be presumed to be a No. 1 target for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nRosin: Mm-hmm.\n\nHarris: And there are kinds of malware that they could get implanted on that phone. There could be very expensive, very sophisticated stuff that could allow them to read the messages on the phone as they’re being typed. That’s why a system like Signal, even though it’s good end-to-end encryption, is not approved for sharing classified information. ’Cause it’s on your phone, which can be hacked.\n\nRosin: Right. So it’s obviously sloppy, reckless. Does it violate any laws?\n\nHarris: So there are a couple that it might. Conceivably, it could violate the Espionage Act, which, despite the name, it’s not just about spying; it’s about the handling of what’s called national-defense information. So if this is considered national-defense information, there are provisions of that law governing how you transmit it, who’s allowed to have it—P.S. Someone like Jeff, who doesn’t have a security clearance? Not allowed to have it. So now these officials made this known to someone who wasn’t cleared—inadvertently, so that could be, you know, a mitigating piece of information. There’s also a provision of the Espionage Act that governs what’s called gross negligence in the handling or, more precisely, the mishandling of classified information. This was the provision that the Justice Department looked at when deciding whether to charge Hillary Clinton for using a private email server, and ultimately they did not, and this provision of the law has only, to my knowledge, been successfully used once to prosecute someone. Because it’s ambiguous—what do you mean by “gross negligence”? Was it grossly negligent to put it on Signal? Was it grossly negligent to add Jeff ? The commonsense reaction to that might be yes. So that’s possible that that could, you know, implicate maybe Mike Waltz or Pete Hegseth, even under the law. And then there’s also the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act.\n\nAnd in this case, I think these text messages are both federal records and presidential records, because they’re coming out of the White House in some cases. And the law says—\n\nGoldberg: Literally, one of the participants is the elected vice president of the United States.\n\nHarris: And another is the White House national security adviser. And we quoted an expert in the story, an expert on these laws, who said: Look, you know, if it’s a presidential record, you have to maintain it. And what that means is, in this case, a backup of these messages would need to be sent to some kind of government official account. If they were doing that, then they’re complying. But there are also DOD regulations about not putting classified information on an unclassified system, as clearly happened here as well.\n\nSo you’ve got a couple of laws, maybe two or three laws, provisions of those laws and regulations, that this activity would seem to violate.\n\nRosin: Well, Jeff, congratulations. You’re now part of the official Trump record—government official record. Okay, theories. I know you don’t know why this happened. Is there some possibility they wanted you to know? Have you run that through your head?\n\nGoldberg: Oh, yeah. I ran all the possibilities through my head. You know, the funny thing is, when they’re having their policy conversation—policy disagreements—I was struck by the sophistication of the arguments. Some were, you know, sort of knee-jerk, anti-Europe kind of invective that one expects, but they were having a serious conversation about what to do about a challenging problem—a problem, by the way, they were left with by the Biden administration, which did not handle that situation well or adequately.\n\nSo they were, this is something they inherited, and they’re trying to work their way through it. As they were doing that, I was thinking to myself, Oh, maybe they want me to see this. So I write a story about how clever they are in dealing with the Houthis. And I thought, That’s very kind of a circular way of getting somebody to write something about—\n\nHarris: Like, Waltz could just call you. He has your number.\n\nGoldberg: They could just call me and say, I’d like to do an interview with you about our Yemen policy, and I’d be like, Great, let’s do it. So I couldn’t, I can’t—you know, Occam’s razor explains a lot of the world, and the explanation here is that it was heading into the weekend; they were out and about; things were happening in the Middle East that they had to stay in touch with; they have these amazing devices in their pockets, like we all do, where they can communicate with the world; they put together a group; they put it together sloppily; and they did it on something that they shouldn’t have done but for convenience; and, uh, that’s it. That’s what happened.\n\nRosin: So given that that can happen to the best of us and does happen to all of us all the time, is there—\n\nGoldberg: You’re always, you’re always planning the bombings of countries on your phone with your podcast team.\n\nRosin: I mean, like, adding the wrong person to a text chain. So given that that happens to the best of us, can you draw any particular conclusions about the Trump administration? Like, does it reveal anything to you about them that’s specific, as opposed to just, you know, they’re sloppy like the rest of us?\n\nHarris: I think there’s that aspect too, which, I mean, there is a little bit of a Who among us?, right? We’ve all done this—I mean, not about planning a war—but we know what this is like and how embarrassing and unintentional it can actually be. But what I do think this shows is a level of recklessness. There’s just no world in which a reasonable person serving these positions would think it’s okay to discuss this kind of active operation, I think, in this way. Now, there may be people who would challenge me on that, and there may be people who would say, Listen, it’s not as bad as it looks; they weren’t getting into totally the operational weeds—even though I think they actually were. You could make excuses for that, but just as a judgment matter, this was a bad one. It was a bad call, I think, to use Signal in this way. It’s not approved for this way. And you can see why it was such a bad call, because a horrible accident like this, from their perspective, can happen. But what I also think it reveals, too—and this is important to the policy debate—is there is not agreement in the administration over whether they’re doing the right thing with this action. There is widespread agreement, it seems, that they should make the Europeans try to pay for this military action, ’cause it’s mostly European goods that are moving through this part of the world. But when the vice president comes out and says, I disagree, and I don’t think that the president understands the implications for this and how it will affect his foreign policy—that’s quite striking.\n\nAnd you see in the messages how they’re referring back to previous meetings that they had where it seemed to some people in the room like this issue was settled. But apparently it wasn’t. And they go on this kind of extended debate about: Well, should we wait a month? And then Stephen Miller, as Jeff said, comes in and says, No, the president said we’re doing this.\n\nAnd so you see that there’s not clarity around the president’s decision making around the policy, and that is just—to be a fly on the wall for that is extraordinary. That’s very revealing about the policy process in this White House.\n\nRosin: You mean for such an important decision that there are last-minute disagreements that haven’t been buttoned up, that haven’t been hashed out, that haven’t gone through proper channels or, you know, like, thoughtfully resolved?\n\nGoldberg: I think they were—I mean, apart from the fact that they were doing it on an insecure channel in the presence of the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine—apart from those two technical issues, they were having a reasonable conversation that you would expect them to have.\n\nAnd like I said, I was a little bit heartened that, Oh—they actually debate among themselves. They talk about this; they work through these things. They seem to be—as Shane pointed out, this is obviously the residue from other meetings that were taking place live and in person, where they’re still working out issues.\n\nWhat I found—maybe just on a personal level or a, you know, a citizen level—disconcerting was when “S M,” who we assume is Stephen Miller or presume is Stephen Miller, when he comes in and says, Nah, I didn’t hear that. I heard the president say, “We’re doing it.” Thank you very much. Call it a day. And then everybody—\n\nHarris: And no one disagrees.\n\nGoldberg: And then everybody, including the secretary of defense, goes: Agree.\n\nBut I have to say, and I want to be very clear here, when I understood that this was real, I did remove myself from the group and began the process of writing this so that I could make the public aware, our reading public aware, that this government had, um, let’s just say poor digital hygiene. So it’s a very serious thing and I would rather not be engaged in that kind of text chain.\n\nRosin: Well, Jeff, Shane, thank you for joining us today.\n\nHarris and Goldberg: Thank you.\n\nRosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudina Ebeid.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "On September 20, 1938, a man who had witnessed the rise of fascism packed his suitcases and fled his home in Berlin. He arranged to have smuggled separately a manuscript that he had drafted in secret over the previous two years. This book was a remarkable one. It clarified what was unfolding in Berlin at the time, the catalyst for its author’s flight.\n\nExplore the May 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nThe man fleeing that day was a Jewish labor lawyer named Ernst Fraenkel. He completed his manuscript two years later at the University of Chicago (where I teach), publishing it as The Dual State, with the modest subtitle A Contribution to the Theory of Dictatorship. The book explains how the Nazi regime managed to keep on track a capitalist economy governed by stable laws—and maintain a day-to-day normalcy for many of its citizens—while at the same time establishing a domain of lawlessness and state violence in order to realize its terrible vision of ethno-nationalism.\n\nFraenkel offered a simple, yet powerful, picture of how the constitutional and legal foundations of the Weimar Republic eroded, and were replaced by strongman-style rule in which the commands of the Nazi Party and its leader became paramount. His perspective was not grounded in abstract political theory; it grew instead from his experience as a Jewish lawyer in Nazi Berlin representing dissidents and other disfavored clients. Academic in tone, The Dual State sketches a template of emerging tyranny distilled from bloody and horrifying experience.\n\nIt was a mistake to think that even the Nazis would entirely dispense with normal laws.\n\nAs Fraenkel explained it, a lawless dictatorship does not arise simply by snuffing out the ordinary legal system of rules, procedures, and precedents. To the contrary, that system—which he called the “normative state”—remains in place while dictatorial power spreads across society. What happens, Fraenkel explained, is insidious. Rather than completely eliminating the normative state, the Nazi regime slowly created a parallel zone in which “unlimited arbitrariness and violence unchecked by any legal guarantees” reigned freely. In this domain, which Fraenkel called the “prerogative state,” ordinary law didn’t apply. (A prerogative power is one that allows a person such as a monarch to act without regard to the laws on the books; theorists from John Locke onward have offered various formulations of the idea.) In this prerogative state, judges and other legal actors deferred to the racist hierarchies and ruthless expediencies of the Nazi regime.\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days\n\nThe key here is that this prerogative state does not immediately and completely overrun the normative state. Rather, Fraenkel argued, dictatorships create a lawless zone that runs alongside the normative state. The two states cohabit uneasily and unstably. On any given day, people or cases could be jerked out of the normative state and into the prerogative one. In July 1936, for example, Fraenkel won a case for employees of an association taken over by the Nazis. A few days later, he learned that the Gestapo had seized the money owed to his clients and deposited it in the government’s coffers. Over time, the prerogative state would distort and slowly unravel the legal procedures of the normative state, leaving a smaller and smaller domain for ordinary law.\n\nYet, Fraenkel insisted, it was a mistake to think that even the Nazis would entirely dispense with normal laws. After all, they had a complex, broadly capitalist economy to maintain. “A nation of 80 million people,” he noted, needs stable rules. The trick was to find a way to keep the law going for Christian Germans who supported or at least tolerated the Nazis, while ruthlessly executing the führer’s directives against the state’s enemies, real and perceived. Capitalism could jog nicely alongside the brutal suppression of democracy, and even genocide.\n\nFraenkel was born in Cologne in December 1898 in the comfortable home of Georg Fraenkel, a merchant, and Therese Epstein. After his parents died, Ernst and his sister were taken in by their uncle in Frankfurt, where Ernst became interested in trade-union activism. Despite his socialist leanings, he joined the German army and was sent to Poland in April 1917. He later wrote that he’d hoped “the war would mean the end of antisemitism.” Fraenkel survived the trenches of the Western Front. After his discharge in 1919, he earned a law degree, and eventually secured work in Berlin as a labor lawyer.\n\nThe war did not, of course, end anti-Semitism, but his military service did save his livelihood, at least for a time. On May 9, 1933—only a few months after the Reichstag burned—Fraenkel and other Jewish lawyers received an official notice prohibiting them from appearing in German courts. But Nazi law made an exception for Jewish lawyers who had served in World War I. And so, while many fled, Fraenkel remained in Berlin, representing litigants such as members of the German Freethinkers Alliance, a leader of the Young Socialist Workers, and a man arrested for insulting a National Socialist newspaper as “old cheese.”\n\nOften, he had to resort to unorthodox strategies. In the last of those three cases, Fraenkel persuaded his client to plead guilty, limiting his arguments to the sentence’s severity. This gambit worked: The man was duly convicted, and received a light sentence, avoiding the fate of others acquitted under similar circumstances. In at least one case, a Gestapo agent appeared as soon as the judge declared a not-guilty verdict, took the defendant into custody, and said, “Kommt nach Dachau” (“Come to Dachau”). Eventually, Fraenkel’s name made it onto a Gestapo list. He and his wife fled first to London, then to Chicago.\n\nFrom the February 1941 issue: A review of Ernst Fraenkel’s The Dual State\n\nToday, we are witnessing the birth of a new dual state. The U.S. has long had a normative state. That system was always imperfect. Our criminal-justice system, for example, sweeps in far too many people, for far too little security in exchange. Even so, it is recognizably part of the normative state.\n\nWhat the Trump administration and its allies are trying to build now, however, is not. The list of measures purpose-built to cleave off a domain in which the law does not apply grows by the day: the pardons that bless and invite insurrectionary violence; the purges of career lawyers at the Justice Department and in the Southern District of New York, inspectors general across the government, and senior FBI agents; the attorney general’s command that lawyers obey the president over their own understanding of the Constitution; the appointment of people such as Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who seem to view their loyalty to the president as more compelling than their constitutional oath; the president’s declaration that he and the attorney general are the sole authoritative interpreters of federal law for the executive branch; the transformation of ordinary spending responsibilities into discretionary tools to punish partisan foes; the stripping of security clearances from perceived enemies and opponents; the threat of criminal prosecutions for speech deemed unfavorable by the president; and the verbal attacks on judges for enforcing the law.\n\nThe peril of the dual state lies in its capacity for targeted suppression.\n\nThe singular aim of these tactics is to construct a prerogative state where cruel caprice, not law, rules. By no measure does the extent of federal law displaced in the first few months of the Trump administration compare with the huge tracts of the Weimar’s legal system eviscerated by the Nazis. But it is striking how Donald Trump’s executive orders reject some basic tenets of American constitutionalism—such as Congress’s power to impose binding rules on how spending and regulation unfold—without which the normative state cannot persist.\n\nThe CEOs who paid for and attended Trump’s second inauguration can look forward to the courts being open for the ordinary business of capitalism. So, too, can many citizens who pay little attention to politics expect to be unscarred by the prerogative state. The normal criminal-justice system, if only in nonpolitical cases, will crank on. Outside the American prerogative state, much will remain as it was. The normative state is too valuable to wholly dismantle.\n\nFor that reason, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Trump’s lawyers—despite running roughshod over Congress, the states, the press, and the civil service—were somewhat slower to defy the federal courts, and have fast-tracked cases to the Supreme Court, seeking a judicial imprimatur for novel presidential powers. The courts, unlike the legislature, remain useful to an autocrat in a dual state.\n\nBuilding a dual state need not end in genocide: Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore have followed the same model of the dual state that Fraenkel described, though neither has undertaken a mass-killing operation as the Nazis did. Their deepest similarity, rather, is that both are intolerant of political dissent and leave the overwhelming majority of citizens alone. The peril of the dual state lies precisely in this capacity for targeted suppression. Most people can ignore the construction of the prerogative state simply because it does not touch their lives. They can turn away while dissidents and scapegoats lose their political liberty. But once the prerogative state is built, as Fraenkel’s writing and experience suggest, it can swallow anyone.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2025 print edition with the headline “A Warning Out of Time.”",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "“This is the time of your life,” the nurse said to me as she searched for a vein. At 27, I finally had health insurance and could get the colonoscopy that doctors had been suggesting for years, so I was feeling pretty good about things—as good as one can feel after having spent the previous 12 hours in the bathroom. But she wasn’t referring to the procedure; she was talking about my age. Even at this very odd, very vulnerable moment, I represented to her freedom and opportunity—your 20s, supposedly the time of your life.\n\nMany people roll their 20s through a sugar coating of nostalgia. But framing young adulthood as the best time of life is a little grim, as it puts a limit on growth. This glorification of youth also seems to assume that everyone has the same resources; moves on the same timeline, in the same way; and has the same kind of life, one filled with adventure and experimentation.\n\nThis decade is supposed to simultaneously be a golden age of rootless freedom and fearless exploration and, somewhat contradictorily, the time when you’re meant to figure out your career, your relationships, and your life goals. That’s a lot of pressure.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve spoken with dozens of 20-somethings from all different backgrounds and in all sorts of circumstances to learn how they understand this time in their life. The young adults I talked with didn’t articulate far-flung fantasies of a #bestlife as Instagram illustrates it. They described a desire to simply feel like enough. They wanted more nuanced conversations about what making your way in the world as a young adult actually means.\n\nFifty years ago, the sociological markers of adulthood included finishing high school, entering the workforce, moving away from home, getting married, and having children. Now, according to a 2017 study, Americans consider the most important adult milestones to be graduating from college or another postsecondary program and achieving financial stability, both sometimes impossible feats. As the researchers Alexis Redding and Nancy E. Hill recently noted in The Atlantic, the ability of young adults to enter adulthood has always been tied closely to how well the economy is doing.\n\nRead: The real reason young adults seem slow to ‘grow up’\n\nAnd the economy is not in our favor. Though we’re the largest part of the workforce, young Millennials own less than 5 percent of the wealth in the United States. When Baby Boomers were in their 20s, they controlled about 21 percent. According to the Economic Policy Institute, from 1979 to 2019, productivity rose 72 percent in the U.S. while hourly pay increased only roughly 17 percent. During the pandemic, young people have been unemployed at more than double the national average, and rates of uninsured young adults have risen, according to data from the Center for Law and Social Policy.\n\nWe all might be grappling with the chaos of finding ourselves and all that comes with it—dating, changing family dynamics, work stress—but the stakes are not the same for everyone. “Defining adulthood for oneself has in many ways become one of the pressures of this developmental period,” Dalal Katsiaficas, an educational-psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told me. “Those with the most power and privilege in our society tend to narrate endless options of what adulthood can look like.” Meanwhile, many of those who are more marginalized describe what she calls “foreclosed” opportunities—some feel locked out of ever achieving adult status, while some take on adult roles much earlier than others.\n\nI’ve been running on a treadmill with little sense of direction, just forward, forward, forward, misguidedly believing that when I “figured it out,” whatever it was, I would finally feel released from the sensation that I was the only one who was lost. I felt disappointed in myself when I dropped out of college, when I lost jobs, when I Googled what a 401(k) was. My missteps felt like personal failures instead of a normal part of life—that is, until I started having honest conversations with other people in their 20s.\n\nThe narrative of the wild-and-free 20-something is far from reality for many. \"Someone who is white in their 20s already sort of has more privilege than someone who is of color, so they have more social mobility and more opportunity to accumulate generational wealth,\" Zaria Howell, 21, told me.\n\nHowell is about to graduate from college, and finding the perfect job isn’t necessarily their top priority. They’re thinking holistically about community, joy, and fulfillment. They are also looking beyond their 20s. “I think it’s harmful to, say, you know, forget about this whole lifetime that you have to accomplish your goals, to meet new people, to travel to new places, to learn new things.”\n\nRobert Zambrano, 25, told me that he failed out of college because of personal issues, and was subsequently forced out of his family home. For three years, he was in an electrical union, training to be an electrician, but he found breaking into the old boys’ club difficult. “Every moment we examine the broader mainstream portrayal of twenty-somethings, it just continually fails to match any reality that we live in,” he wrote me by email.\n\nThat includes the trope that all of young adulthood is blissful Instagramming and soul-searching, as if 20-somethings aren’t also caretakers, breadwinners, and parents. LaTesha Harris, 23, began working as a young teenager, helping her mom with rent and utility bills. “Adulting has been very much tied to financial burden,” Harris told me. The majority of people she knows, she said, have no money, no respect from anyone older, no autonomy in the workplace. “It’s like there are a lot of things to realize about yourself and also the world in this time period,” Harris said. “Because that’s such an overwhelming task, I can't see how anyone would consider this the best time in your life.”\n\nRead: When are you really an adult?\n\nShowlin Salam, 26, did everything young people are encouraged to do: She pursued an education as a first-generation student while working full-time, graduated, and got married. Up until recently, she was a frontline worker doing 12-hour days at a pharmacy, where she dealt with customers who spit and coughed on her. Despite reminders to “take care of your mental health,” she was given no resources to do so, and is experiencing anxiety and depression. The “You’re young; it’ll work out!” talking point isn’t helping. Young people aren’t searching for glamorous versions of happiness, Salam told me. Instead, she feels like she’s barely hanging on. “I’m looking for being content, and just finding joy,” she said. “That’s what we are looking for, as Millennials and Gen Z, because of this instability that we're living in right now.”\n\nThe one-size-fits-all narrative of your 20s needs to change. Reports on young adults moving in with their parents at record rates spin that as a moral failure, rather than an economic side effect or a choice made for cultural or family reasons. Remarks about young people being lazy ignore how few jobs are available. Quips about students needing to work overlook how many are working—and how many are still experiencing basic-needs insecurity. Moans about 20-somethings not having kids rarely mention the child-care crisis.\n\nAccording to Katsiaficas, we need policies that support affordable education, living wages, student-debt relief, and a sense of safety and belonging in society—quality-of-life issues that, once addressed, would allow people of all ages to imagine futures that are self-directed. “These are basic needs that have been steadily eroded for young adults,” she said.\n\nWe are growing into ourselves across a whole lifetime, not just throughout one decade. Let’s all retire the idea of our 20s as a #bestlife—and just strive for a good one.",

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.

However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

Kennedy Jr., center, with his wife Cheryl Hines, shakes hands with Justice Neil Gorsuch after being sworn in on February 13, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynods/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKerr v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is one of the most straightforward cases the Supreme Court will hear this year. It involves a federal law that requires every state’s Medicaid program to ensure that “any individual eligible for medical assistance” may obtain that care “from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required.”\n\nThus, Medicaid patients, and not the state, clearly have a right to choose their own health providers, with only one exception. The provider must be “qualified,” which, as the federal appeals court that heard this case explained, means that the provider is “professionally competent” to provide the care that the patient seeks.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nNevertheless, South Carolina, along with several other states, attempted to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program in violation of this statute. The reason, of course, involves abortion.\n\nIn 2018, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order forbidding “abortion clinics” from being paid to provide care to Medicaid patients. Though the state is permitted to ban abortion outright under the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), South Carolina permits abortions up to the sixth week of pregnancy.\n\nBut the state is not allowed, under the Medicaid statute at the heart of Kerr, to prevent Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion-related care — at least as long as Planned Parenthood’s providers are competent to provide this care. And the state admits in its brief that it did not cut off Planned Parenthood because it believes that its doctors are professionally incompetent. According to that brief, Planned Parenthood could “restore Medicaid funding if it stops performing abortions — but it has chosen not to do so.”\n\nSo how on Earth did this straightforward case wind up before the highest Court in the country? The answer to that has two parts, one legal, the other political.\n\nThe legal issue is that South Carolina claims that the federal law allowing Medicaid patients to choose their health providers is virtually unenforceable. And the state is correct that the Supreme Court’s rules governing when individual patients may sue to enforce federal Medicaid law are complicated, although not nearly as complicated as its lawyers claim.\n\nThe political issue is that this case involves abortion, an issue that often causes judges to place politics above law. And so, while most federal appeals courts have concluded that the choice-of-provider law is enforceable, two GOP-dominated courts did not. The Supreme Court typically steps in to resolve legal questions that have divided federal appeals courts.\n\nNotably, however, both of the lower courts that ruled against Medicaid patients did so before the Supreme Court decided Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), a significant decision clarifying which provisions of federal Medicaid law can be enforced through private lawsuits. The Talevski case cuts strongly in favor of Medicaid patients, and against South Carolina’s position in this case.\n\nSo it’s likely that even this Supreme Court will reject South Carolina’s attack on Planned Parenthood. The law in this case is simply too clear, and it was recently reaffirmed in Talevski, a decision that is less than two years old.\n\nStill, nothing is ever certain when an abortion-related case reaches this Court, as most of its Republican members have a history of handing down preposterous interpretations of the law in order to restrict abortion rights. If the six Republicans on the Supreme Court were to abandon longstanding law, that could have disastrous consequences for Medicaid patients, and for thousands of other Americans.\n\nThe specific legal issue in Kerr, briefly explained\n\nA federal law known as “Section 1983” is probably the most important civil rights statute ever enacted by Congress. It permits state officials to be sued in federal court if they deprive someone of “any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” Without this law, many federal laws and even many provisions of the Constitution would be unenforceable, because there would be no way to bring a lawsuit vindicating the rights protected by those legal provisions.\n\nNotably, Section 1983 does not permit anyone to bring a lawsuit challenging any violation of any federal law whatsoever. Instead, as the Court said in Blessing v. Freestone (1997), “a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”\n\nTalevski, meanwhile, laid out the Court’s framework for determining whether a particular federal law creates a right that may be enforced through private lawsuits. The key question is whether “the provision in question is ‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited’ and contains ‘rights-creating,’ individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class.’”\n\nThus, if Congress passed a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating at Taco Bell,” that statute would be enforceable through private lawsuits because its language focuses on the people who benefit from it (people who are hungry). A similar statute stating that “states shall not impede access to cheap burritos” would likely not be enforceable through such lawsuits, because this hypothetical law is silent regarding who is supposed to benefit from it. The second version of this law would, at the very least, need to have some language focused on the people the law was supposed to protect in order to authorize private suits.\n\nAnd so, with Talevski’s framework in mind, consider the statutory language at issue in the Kerr case:\n\nA State plan for medical assistance must … provide that … any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required (including an organization which provides such services, or arranges for their availability, on a prepayment basis), who undertakes to provide him such services.\n\nThis law is riddled with the kind of “individual-centric language” with an “unmistakable focus on the benefited class” demanded by Talevski. It provides a right to “any individual” eligible for Medicaid benefits. It provides that these individuals “may obtain” care from their choice of provider. And it concludes with a pronoun (“him”) which refers back to the individuals who benefit from the law.\n\nSouth Carolina’s lawyers — most of whom work for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the Christian right law firm that unsuccessfully tried to get the Supreme Court to ban the abortion drug mifepristone — essentially ask the justices to replace Talevski with a new rule that would drastically limit private lawsuits enforcing Medicaid statutes, and many other laws that are enforced through Section 1983 lawsuits.\n\nSpecifically, they claim that the Court has heard only four cases where it ultimately concluded that a federal law contains the kind of language that Talevski requires, two of which explicitly used the word “right,” and two of which used language that “closely mirrors the text of the Fifth Amendment.” Based on this claim, they then allege that the Supreme Court “has limited ‘clear rights-creating language’ to statutes where Congress explicitly uses the label ‘right’ or lifts language from the rights-creating provisions of the Constitution.”\n\nBut that is not what the Court said in Talevski. Again, Talevski did not hold that Congress must use certain magical words or a statute is unenforceable. It held that federal laws may be enforced by private lawsuits if they focus on the individuals who benefit from the law, regardless of which specific words Congress used when it wrote that law.\n\nIf the Court were to impose such a magic words requirement in Kerr, moreover, that would have disastrous consequences for Medicaid beneficiaries and for many other Americans.\n\nCongress could not possibly have known, when it wrote the original Medicaid law in 1965 or when it wrote any of the various amendments to it, that the Supreme Court would later require it to use very specific language if it wanted the law to be enforceable. Nor could it have known that the Court would impose a magic words requirement when it wrote countless other federal laws.\n\nBecause the laws governing Medicaid were not written with the ADF’s proposed new rule in mind, huge swaths of that law could cease to function if the Court agrees with ADF in this case.\n\nIn fairness, federal law does provide one alternative remedy if the Supreme Court does shut down private lawsuits enforcing Medicaid law — the federal government can cut off Medicaid funding to states that violate this law. But the government rarely uses this power, because it effectively punishes Medicaid patients and providers for a legal violation by the state. And, in any event, there’s little chance that the Trump administration will use this power to protect abortion providers.",

It might’ve been when you languished in the waiting room at a doctor’s office for 10 minutes too long. Or you felt your eyes glaze over in the middle of a philosophy class. Perhaps it was on a never-ending drive wherein your toddler insisted on hearing the same song over and over and over again. Maybe you are exceedingly bored right now (in which case, I’m sorry, and I hope to recapture your attention).\n\nBoredom is a common occurrence in the ebb and flow of life. It’s usually marked by a feeling of restlessness and agitation, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo and the co-author of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. A hunch that you must get out of here immediately.\n\nRelated How to be alone with your thoughts\n\nThere is a functional aspect to boredom, though. The emotion is motivating, meant to spur you to action: This thing you’re doing is not fulfilling or meaningful, so go find something else that is. Some are better at listening to that alarm than others, Danckert says, and those who say they never get bored are probably more skilled at dealing with it. Those who respond productively to the messages boredom sends have the power to make changes in their lives, big and small, which is great for you and bad for boredom. “Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do,” Danckert says. “It just tells you you need to do something else.” It’s up to you to figure out what that is.\n\nA desire for something different\n\nWhile you’ve surely experienced boredom at some point or another, have you stopped to consider why? Erin Westgate, an assistant professor of social psychology at the University of Florida who studies boredom, defines the feeling as one in which we don’t want to or can’t engage with what we’re doing, either because we lack the attention to do it — because the task is too easy or too difficult — or it lacks meaning. Boredom can strike momentarily — the impossibility of focusing while reading a dense book, for instance — or it can take root over a longer period of time, such as when you find yourself working an unfulfilling job.\n\n“Boredom doesn’t do the hard work of telling you what to do. It just tells you you need to do something else.”\n\nBoredom can be fairly universal: Few find waiting in line at the DMV a particularly riveting experience. But it is individual, too. A movie you consider engrossing may be a snooze to another viewer. This is why some people find being alone with their thoughts excruciating, while others revel in mind wandering, Westgate says. Sitting with your inner monologue absent other distractions is not equivalent to being bored, at least not for everyone. However, it can be boring if you don’t particularly enjoy solitude.\n\nAnother common misconception: “People often conflate boredom with not having anything to do,” Westgate says. On the contrary, if your day consists of monotonous, repetitive tasks, you may not have much downtime but feel bored. The uber-busy who claim to crave boredom may in fact be yearning for quiet contendedness, a moment to relax.\n\nIt’s true that filling your days with constant activities and entertainment may prevent you from getting bored in the first place. While this doesn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing, if you’re constantly masking boredom with another podcast or just one more episode, “you are preventing yourself from knowing when you’ve gone off track from what you value and what you care about and what you can give to the world,” Westgate says.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

Those who see being bored as an impediment and frustration tend to be bored more often, says Wijnand Van Tilburg, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Essex. On the contrary, those who see boredom as an inevitability of life get less bored and, when they do, cope with it more effectively.\n\nAnd despite anecdotal evidence that says otherwise, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity, research shows. Instead, it’s the moderately engaging activities, like showering or taking a walk, that actually lead to inspiration. The shower or the walk is neither so engrossing or boring as to distract your thoughts from churning — that’s the sweet spot you should be aiming for.\n\nMaking the most of boredom\n\nSo how can you better deal with boredom when it strikes? How can you adequately decode what your boredom is signaling?\n\nWhen the feeling does arise, use it as a reminder that what you’re doing isn’t meaningful and to seek out something that is, experts say. This will differ depending on the context. You might pop in a podcast while folding laundry to help make the chore feel less like drudgery. Perhaps you could head to YouTube to find a bread-making tutorial on a dreary afternoon. “It doesn’t really matter what it is,” Danckert says, “but you have to deem it to be valid and worth doing.”\n\nFor circumstances where you’re unable to up and leave, such as school or work, Westgate suggests trying to make the experience more profound. “Focus on why am I here and what’s the deeper purpose it’s serving so that the experience feels more meaningful,” she says.\n\nDespite anecdotal evidence to the contrary, boredom doesn’t lead to inspired breakthroughs and increased creativity.\n\nOr maybe you’re growing impatient on a long road trip: Try to find challenges or ways to make the situation more stimulating. Car games exist for a reason. Or make up your own. “My brother and I, growing up, used to play this game called ‘Who would you ask for help?’” Westgate says. “In this room right now, if you had to pick one person to ask for help, who would it be and why?”\n\nOf course, the solution to a soul-crushingly boring job might be to find another one that gives your life more meaning and purpose. Since this isn’t exactly easy or realistic for many people, Danckert suggests reframing your current employment situation: You’re not living to work, you’re working to live. That is, your job gives you money which allows you to do meaningful activities in your free time.\n\nFor more short-term boredom, like waiting in line for a sandwich, Westgate says there’s nothing wrong with using your phone as entertainment to pass the time. “If looking at your phone is a form of distraction for a few minutes, that lets you stick with that boring, uncomfortable activity that you still need to do, that’s probably fine,” she says. “I think the problem becomes when that is our response to all boredom.”\n\nIf you’re using your phone as a crutch every time you feel the slightest whisper of boredom, you may develop some unhealthy habits — like scrolling on the sidelines at your kid’s soccer game or while driving. In fact, constantly scrolling through short videos, like on TikTok, increases boredom, a study found. “It reduces attention capacity, it reduces perceptions of meaning in one’s activity,” Van Tilburg says. It “increases boredom, even though people think that doing so will help alleviate it.”\n\nInstead of using your devices as a boredom security blanket, Van Tilburg suggests getting more comfortable breaking it up in myriad, tangible ways, like striking up a conversation while in line for coffee or creating phone-free areas at home (like the bedroom and bathroom). Try to embrace mind wandering instead of fearing silence.\n\nBoredom is a lot like goldilocks: You shouldn’t avoid it completely, but too much of it isn’t good either. Life doesn’t need to be a monotonous fog, nor is it supposed to be perpetually rapturously engaging.",

To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nIn the middle of the Caribbean Sea, over 1,000 rhesus macaques live on an island that measures less than a tenth of a mile across. Descendants of a monkey colony imported from India 86 years ago sunbathe, climb trees, and wade in the ocean on Puerto Rico’s Isla de los Monos.\n\nThe island serves as a 38-acre open-air laboratory, with these semi-wild macaques as subjects. The monkeys offer a tantalizing opportunity for scientists hoping to observe animal behavior as close to the wild as they can get, while also having ready access to the monkeys’ brains, bodies, and genes. That often means killing them.\n\nOne morning in 2021, researchers transported a monkey, like thousands before him, to a laboratory at the Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) at the University of Puerto Rico less than 50 miles away. “We watched him die,” former research assistant Alyssa told me in a video call last summer. “And then we did what we always do, which is take him apart.” (Vox has changed her name to protect her from retaliation.) Killing and dissecting monkeys — up to seven per day, she remembers — was part of the lab’s standard protocol.\n\nDuring the culling season in the fall, hundreds of monkeys are killed to control the population of the tiny island. Rather than let their bodies go to waste, Alyssa’s team dissected them, meticulously preserving their muscles, organs, and brains for studies attempting to connect the monkeys’ social lives to their anatomy and genetics.\n\nAlyssa joined the lab in 2021, after graduating college. Before accepting the job, the lab’s principal investigator called her, asking whether she was comfortable with blood. She said yes — she wasn’t squeamish, and had no trouble dissecting frogs and lamb hearts in school. “It didn’t raise any flags for me at all,” she said.\n\nAlyssa’s soon-to-be boss then described perfusion, a euthanasia procedure where, in their lab, a deeply anesthetized monkey is strapped to a table and pumped with saline and preservatives while their blood is pumped out. This preserves the animal’s tissue for study after death. But, Alyssa said, he left out that the researchers would be witnessing living animals die in front of them, “no matter whether it was old, whether it was an infant…” She paused. “We dissected infants.”\n\nEvery day, Alyssa watched at least one monkey die on an operating table, before she would immediately start cutting into it. Her job was to carefully separate all of the organs and tissues and store them in a freezer, preserving them until other scientists could analyze them. She wore a specially fitted mask to avoid breathing in bone dust while sawing through skulls.\n\nHow I reported this From day one of my Future Perfect fellowship — exactly one year after my last day working with monkeys as a PhD student — I knew I wanted to write this story. I was sure I wasn’t alone in my post-animal research angst, but I wanted to find others willing to share their experiences with me. I ended up speaking with nearly a dozen people, these interviews capturing all of my own unspoken feelings: that it’s impossible to explain what one sees in these facilities, but dissociating from it is impossible, too. Over the next several months, I weaved pieces of these conversations together with my reporting on mental health in academia and animal testing regulation. The nuance of this piece was tricky, and my goal throughout was to highlight flaws in the academic system without undermining the value and necessity of the research itself. I worked with a team of editors, fact-checkers, and lawyers to get there. (The first draft of this piece was nearly twice as long as what you’re reading now!)\n\nAs she settled into her new routine, she realized just how difficult her day-to-day life would be to explain to outsiders. “The thing that was so crazy to me,” Alyssa said, “was no one else will know what has happened here.”\n\nShe vented about the monkeys on her daily calls to her boyfriend some 1,600 miles away back home. But he couldn’t handle story after story of relentless, visceral gore, so Alyssa turned to her therapist. After crying over the phone, she waited for the calm reassurance she’d come to expect. Instead, her therapist told Alyssa that she was really worried for her mental health. “I surprised myself with how alone I was feeling,” she remembered.\n\nThe night terrors began when she came back home. Culling season was over, but Alyssa woke up to panic attacks for months. She’d flinch whenever someone approached her from behind at work or surprised her in public. Symptoms piled up for months before a psychiatrist named what she was experiencing: post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nA multimedia artist as well as a scientist, Alyssa started creating art inspired by the necropsies seared into her memory — anything to make the images visible to the outside world. During our video call, she reached out of frame and pulled out a life-sized crochet replica of a macaque’s gastrointestinal system.\n\nIn the necropsy lab, Alyssa cut each monkey’s gastrointestinal tract from rectum to esophagus, picked it up with triple-gloved hands, and weighed it — part of their standard protocol for collecting and preserving tissues after dissection. An adult macaque’s intestines can be over a dozen feet long, and weigh a good deal more than a ball of yarn. To make the plush guts feel as hefty as she remembered, “I put beads inside them,” she said, “so when you lift it up, it would feel like what you would do every day.”\n\n“I made three: a big, a medium, and an infant-sized.” Alyssa said, holding the tiniest replica, a fuzzy marble-filled snake, to the camera. “I was obsessed with describing to other people what we had seen in that place.”\n\nOne of Alyssa’s crochet gastrointestinal tracts, photographed by her.\n\nAlyssa’s experience is anything but rare. Animal research, while largely hidden from public view, is widespread across the life sciences. Animals are used in everything from safety testing for medicines, cosmetics, and pesticides to exploring open-ended questions about how the mind and body work. The drugs we take, the products we use, and the medical breakthroughs we celebrate have been made possible in large part by lab animals and the people who, in the name of science, kill them.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to find the exact number of scientists, veterinarians, and animal caretakers working in research facilities, we know that somewhere around 100 million animals — mice, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, monkeys, fish, and birds, among others — are used for research and testing worldwide each year. While the Government Accountability Office reported in 2024 that NIH spends about $5.5 billion annually to support animal research, other estimates by activist groups like PETA are significantly higher.\n\nAnimal research is traumatic — obviously for the animals unlucky enough to be involved, but also for many of the humans tasked with harming them. Yet from day one, institutions teach animal researchers that expressing discomfort is akin to weakness, or tantamount to dismissing the value of science altogether. To compete for increasingly rare tenure-track jobs, graduate students and postdocs have no choice but to learn to suppress their emotions and get the work done. Principal investigators, senior scientists who direct animal research labs, often don’t care whether inserting electrodes into a conscious, chronically ill monkey’s brain makes you squeamish. If you can’t handle the heat, they say, get out of the kitchen.\n\n“The costs have always been out there,” bioethicist and former animal researcher John Gluck said. “They’ve just been completely ignored.”\n\nI would know. I spent thousands of hours immersed in the world of researching monkeys (known in the scientific community as NHPs, or nonhuman primates), attempting to study how the brain weighs options during decision-making. In 2023, I graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a PhD in neuroscience, questionable data, zero academic publications, and an intense combination of guilt, rage, and burnout that I’m only just beginning to process.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly how many researchers suffer mental health consequences from their work, and it’s impossible to disentangle the psychological side effects of harming animals from those of trying to survive in an unforgiving, underpaid, and poorly regulated workplace. I do know that many people I know who worked in an animal research facility, myself included, left feeling broken. “Everybody that I know has horror stories,” Alyssa agreed.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CPRC told Vox that it is “deeply committed to supporting our researchers’ mental health and well-being,” and that its researchers are encouraged to seek mental health resources. “As an organization, we remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding the highest ethical, safety, and compliance standards. Our operations align with all applicable federal and institutional guidelines. We actively foster a professional, respectful, and collaborative environment where researchers can openly discuss challenges and seek support,” the statement said.\n\nAcademic institutions have long avoided talking openly about the trauma of animal research. In part, they’re afraid that acknowledging it might invite scrutiny from animal rights activists and undermine the public’s already damaged trust in science. The reality is that it’s easier to downplay the emotional toll of animal testing than to confront the ethical and logistical challenges of dealing with it, given just how central it is to biomedical research.\n\nNow, as the Trump administration wages an unprecedented war on scientific institutions, this might feel like a particularly sensitive time to air uncomfortable conversations about painful aspects of science out in the open. But the scientific community can no longer avoid hard conversations about the psychological costs borne by young scientists. If universities and funding agencies admit that there’s a problem, they can take meaningful steps — like providing better mental health resources and investing in non-animal research methods — to improve conditions for everyone.\n\nBut if young researchers are left to suffer in silence, it is science itself that will suffer, as bright, empathetic minds turn away from some of the most important questions in research — or worse, leave the field altogether.\n\nWhy do we still experiment on animals?\n\nThe practice of experimenting on animals is as old as biological science itself. To understand a machine, you have to take it apart and figure out how the pieces fit together. Living bodies are biological machines — to understand how bodies grow, get sick, and recover, scientists have to take them apart.\n\nIn the earliest days of Western science, dissection of both animals and human cadavers laid the groundwork for modern surgery and medicine. Today, scientists have many more tools at their disposal, enabling them to make specific cells in a mouse’s brain glow under a microscope or to remote-control a living fruit fly. What hasn’t changed is that most of the time, animals are killed when an experiment ends — whether by relatively hands-off methods like gas chambers, or wincingly hands-on methods like snapping their necks, which goes by the more clinical term “cervical dislocation.”\n\nFor all its ethical problems, animal research has yielded medical breakthroughs that we take for granted today. Without lab animals, we wouldn’t have polio vaccines, PrEP (an HIV-prevention medication that slashes sexual transmission risk by 99 percent), or deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBut animals often make poor substitutes for humans. Much of biomedical science ends up stranded in what researchers call the “valley of death”: the huge divide between promising preclinical studies, many of which involve testing on animals, and genuine breakthroughs in human medicine. Over 90 percent of preclinical trials for cancer drugs, for example, don’t translate to successful clinical trials, because treatments that seem to work in mice fail in humans.\n\nComplex socio-psychological conditions like depression are especially challenging to model in caged animals that can’t have natural — much less human-like — experiences. Even monkeys, our close genetic relatives, are stressed and often behave abnormally when caged in a lab, making them poor proxies for uncaged humans.\n\nSome newer tools, like AI models and 3D-printed human tissues, are beginning to replace animals in some studies, But not all animal-based methods have alternatives. AI, for example, has to be trained on real-world data to accurately reflect real-world biology. If that data doesn’t exist yet, scientists need to collect it — usually from the body of a lab animal. And many of medicine’s most urgent, complex problems, like cancer, affect the whole body in ways that are hard to predict without invasively experimenting on a living organism.\n\nNew initiatives like NIH’s Complement Animal Research in Experimentation Program, which has funded the development of new human-based biomedical tools, may encourage some researchers to pivot away from animal testing. But funding agencies in the US and elsewhere are only just beginning to incentivize scientists to develop alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, funding agencies and research institutions are striving to prove the legitimacy of animal research to the public even as the Trump administration seeks to defund science. Animal researchers know that their work is heavily scrutinized by animal rights activists, who are looking for vulnerabilities to galvanize the public around. Americans are divided on animal research, but the vast majority say it should be phased out in favor of non-animal methods.\n\nOne postdoctoral researcher I spoke with, who works with mice, told me that a lab on her campus lost NIH funding following a PETA campaign, which also drove hate mail and threats against the scientists who worked there. These experiences breed defensiveness and close researchers off from engaging with critics. “Our interactions with [animal rights] groups are often at conferences, with people protesting outside and yelling at you,” she said. “It just propagates that negative interaction.”\n\nSo young animal researchers with misgivings are told to keep quiet. When I was in grad school, senior scientists told me that publicly expressing discomfort — or even sharing day-to-day details of my work — would only enrage animal rights activists and potentially fuel further distrust in science. But this silence comes at a cost, stifling innovation and entrenching outdated methods.\n\n“We’re highly leveraged by the system to keep doing what we’ve always done,” said Garet Lahvis, former graduate program director of behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health and Science University. (Lahvis previously wrote about experimenting on caged primates for Vox.) Turning against a tried-and-true method would require a scientist to invalidate their existing body of work, or at least acknowledge that it was unethical, ineffective, or inefficient. So, many don’t.\n\nWant to learn more about animal research? Check out “Animal testing, explained.” Here, I walked through what experimenting on animals actually looks like, why scientists do it, and who is looking out for the welfare of the animals. I also spoke with some researchers who are developing new animal-free tools for biomedical research, and discussed what it will take to replace animals entirely.\n\nOver the past few decades, meanwhile, the grant application process has become increasingly competitive, driving scientists to do whatever it takes to make their project proposals sound appealing to potential funders. A 2023 survey of biomedical researchers found that reviewers of grants and peer-reviewed publications generally remain biased in favor of projects with animal-based methods, creating an incentive for scientists to use animals.\n\nLisa Jones-Engel, a former senior scientist at the University of Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) and current senior science adviser at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), recalled serving on the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, an ethics oversight panel responsible for reviewing and approving the university’s animal research proposals. She went line by line through each protocol to find ethical breaches worth addressing, but was constantly shut down by her colleagues, who she suspected were more interested in quickly pushing proposals through the pipeline than protecting animal welfare.\n\n“We encourage responsibility and accountability for ensuring ethical and responsible animal care, science, and human welfare,” WaNPRC told Vox in an email. The university did not comment on Jones-Engel’s experience, but emphasized that researchers are encouraged to report ethical concerns to their principal adviser, department chair, or anonymously, if necessary.\n\n“I spent 17 years at the university, and it nearly killed me,” Jones-Engel told me. “I thought that I could single-handedly bring about change just by laying the science out in front of my scientific colleagues. It turns out that I wasn’t able to do that.”\n\nWhy would anyone sign up for this?\n\nMadeline Krasno grew up loving animals, and hoped to follow in Jane Goodall’s footsteps as a primatologist. In 2011, the then-20-year-old applied to be a student caretaker at the Harlow Primate Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, she and one other undergraduate were responsible for weekend feeding, medication, and cleaning the rooms of over 500 monkeys. She believed what she was told: Those monkeys were contributing to important biomedical studies, helping scientists make necessary public health breakthroughs. At least, she recalled, “That’s what you tell yourself to make this okay.”\n\nTo boost their chances of getting into competitive graduate programs, many undergrads and recent college graduates eagerly accept entry-level, relatively low-paid jobs like these.\n\nDay one at a primate research center in the US can shock even the most hardened scientist. As a neuroscience PhD student, I spent a lot of time in my lab’s monkey housing room, which always smelled like stale urine and honey. Netflix shows played for a few hours a day on a wall-mounted TV as veterinarian-approved “enrichment” for the animals, who lived in pairs in metal cages smaller than my full-size bed.\n\nA laboratory monkey interacting with an employee at the National Primate Research Center of Thailand. AFP via Getty Images\n\nSome research groups, like mine, introduce new trainees to these spaces right away to gauge whether they have the stomach for it. Others don’t expose trainees to the most disturbing aspects of their work until they’ve proven themselves trustworthy.\n\nFormer research assistant Mayo Asada wasn’t invited into her neurobiology lab’s back rooms, where surgeries take place, for the first month that she worked at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis (CNPRC) in 2021. The first time Asada saw her lab’s monkeys, it was necropsy day. She watched a handler bring a young male monkey into a sterile examination room, “holding his hand to keep him calm.” The monkey was anesthetized and pumped with saline, like the monkeys in Alyssa’s lab. As blood left the unconscious monkey, Asada watched as people began removing parts of his body. “We know that you weren’t expecting to see this,” Asada was told.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if he was conscious, or how aware he was of what was happening,” Asada remembers, referring to the monkey. “I was hoping by then that he was in an altered state.” Asada paused. “I honestly don’t remember the rest. I just remember the pieces being separated onto different tables.”\n\nDespite her shock and discomfort, Asada stuck around. Biomedical careers, especially in academia, often hinge on your superiors’ opinions. If your well-connected adviser likes you, their glowing letter of recommendation can open doors to prestigious jobs. If they don’t, those doors slam shut. The vibe she remembered from superiors in her lab, Asada said, was: “Don’t mess with us. We will ruin your career.”\n\nUC Davis told Vox in a statement that it offers free mental health counseling services to employees and students, and that “harassment, discrimination, bullying, and other abusive conduct violates university policy. Anyone experiencing or witnessing such conduct is encouraged to report it: we take such reports very seriously and reports are investigated and addressed according to applicable policies and procedures.”\n\nMany early-career researchers believe that the knowledge they gain from their experiments will justify the harm they will cause. After all, breakthrough treatments like gene therapy and organ transplantation were refined in lab animals before humans. I spent years convincing myself that by recording the brain activity of monkeys, I could uncover crucial information about mental health that would someday revolutionize how we treat depression. Eventually, the emotional labor of justifying the work outweighed my belief in its purpose.\n\nMonkey research makes up a small share of all animal research — but working with much more widely used rodent species can still be harrowing, if to a lesser degree than for scientists experimenting on our primate cousins. On the subreddit r/labrats, an anonymous forum for over 650,000 biologists, many posts feature variations on the same existential crisis: reckoning with the intense pressure to harm animals, whether for the sake of public health or professional advancement.\n\nOne recent post asked how people “get past the initial ick” of killing mice. Many users replied, quite simply, that you don’t. In the comments, researchers describe a wide range of coping mechanisms: Sing to the animals. Thank each mouse before putting them in the carbon dioxide chamber. Practice until you can perform injections as painlessly as possible. Or, one user wrote, “just do it until you’re numb to it.”\n\nWhile hosing down cages, Krasno blasted Adele’s then-new album 21 through noise-canceling headphones to drown out the screeching monkeys around her. Now, she can’t listen to “Rolling in the Deep” without being transported back to those rooms, and the guilt she felt in her complacency. “I’m just trying to do what I can for them,” she remembered, “but also to, like, get the fuck out.”\n\nIn an email statement, UW-Madison shared that it offers confidential counseling and crisis support to students and employees, and leads workshops on identifying and responding to stress related to caring for people and animals.\n\nHow academia creates a culture of silence\n\nAs an animal researcher, my life was dictated by animal care.\n\nSeveral times a week, I performed a standard procedure to keep the window into each monkey’s brain — a small hole cut through their skull — open and infection-free. While listening to an episode of This American Life or All Songs Considered, I’d fix a monkey’s head in place, lift a plastic covering off his exposed skull opening, and gently swab and suction new wisps of tissue growth from the leathery membrane covering his brain.\n\nPicture a gloved dental hygienist, sticking a metal pick and a suction doodad in your mouth, casually chitchatting while you’re stuck staring at the ceiling. Over time, I learned to dissociate enough to pretend I was just one of those hygienists.\n\nBut intentionally separating your mind and body is exhausting work. After five years of drowning out screeches and whirring medical tools with podcasts and noise-canceling headphones, I couldn’t feel anything anymore. I spent those years lying about my job on dates, omitting details from my closest friends, and filtering myself in calls with my therapist. At first, I told myself that they wouldn’t understand. Eventually, as my experiments failed over and over, it stopped making sense to me, too.\n\n“We are the mad scientists. We are like the people in horror films, torturing them. It’s crazy what we do to handle it.”\n\nAlmost every researcher I spoke with had a similar experience. Andrew — a former graduate student, whose name has been changed to protect him from harassment — left his position at a major US primate research center in 2022, after spending two years studying infectious diseases in juvenile monkeys. A long-time animal lover, he was initially horrified by the deaths and dissections required to investigate the effects of viral infections on developing brains and bodies. To get through his master’s degree, he dissociated.\n\n“We are the mad scientists. We are like the people in horror films, torturing them. It’s crazy what we do to handle it,” he told me last summer. In the end, the forced apathy crushed what enthusiasm he once had for academic research. “It felt like I was chewed up and spit out.”\n\nFor some researchers, the numbness, anxiety, and distress linger long after the work is done. At CNPRC, Asada turned to alcohol to self-medicate. “I don’t like drinking, but I would drink myself to sleep every night,” she said. “What prompted me to leave was realizing that no one that worked there was okay.” (UC Davis, in a statement, said students can access support through Student Health and Counseling Services, and employees through the Academic and Staff Assistance Program.)\n\nAcademic science has a well-documented mental health problem. A 2018 survey of about 2,300 early-career science researchers across 26 countries reported that 41 percent had moderate to severe anxiety, and 39 percent had moderate to severe depression — often correlated with reports of poor work-life balance and bad relationships with advisers. One study of about 200 Korean scientists found that animal researchers had significantly higher anxiety scores than non-animal researchers.\n\nNor does it help that the scientific enterprise runs a bit like a feudal system, with powerful professors at the top, and postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research assistants at the bottom. The only real way to advance is through having a well-connected mentor at a prestigious, highly-resourced university. But that means anything that might alienate that senior scientist — like questioning the lab’s animal care protocols or experimental techniques — could place your job or even your scientific future at risk.\n\n“So much of science relies on senior research leaders, who don’t have to get their hands dirty anymore, convincing their junior colleagues they have no other options than to do work so violent and disturbing that it makes many of them suicidal,” a pseudonymous X account, run by a graduate student in the sciences who works with non-animal models, posted last August.\n\nThe limits of “compassion fatigue”\n\nWhat limited peer-reviewed research has been done on the mental health effects of lab animal care — usually surveys of veterinarians and animal care technicians — focuses on the concept of “compassion fatigue,” a form of burnout brought on by providing care in exhausting, traumatic environments. Institutions know that early-career scientists struggling with their mental health, even brilliant ones, are likely to leave academia. Academic departments with doctoral training programs also know that losing students looks bad on grant applications, leading reviewers to question their stability and leadership.\n\nSome universities are trying to respond to the crisis. Dare 2 Care, a program at the University of Washington, aims to remedy compassion fatigue by suggesting that workers do things like connect with peers, place heart-shaped stickers indicating planned euthanasia dates on mouse cages, and express gratitude to lab animals for their sacrifice. Giving workers the chance to emotionally prepare for the end of a study — when animals like mice are usually killed — “fosters a sense of closure and reduces emotional distress,” WaNPRC told Vox in an email.\n\nBut “these animals are not choosing to be sacrificed,” said Krasno. Compassion fatigue training, she suspects, is more of a Band-Aid than a solution, with the primary goal of boosting staff retention by reframing an employee’s unease as a personal issue to be managed, rather than an inevitable consequence of their work.\n\n\n\nCompassion fatigue is a common experience for lab veterinarians and animal care technicians — the workers who are tasked with day-to-day maintenance work, like cleaning cages, prepping food, and physically examining lab animals. But one study reported that over three-quarters of animal care workers surveyed felt that institutional compassion fatigue programs didn’t help them manage their symptoms. WaNPRC pointed me to another report, which found that only 24 percent of surveyed animal care workers said compassion fatigue support programming helped improve their symptoms.\n\nWhat institutions ask of tech staff “is hurting these people,” said Jones-Engel, who worked with lab primates for 17 years before becoming a scientist at PETA. “They’re the ones that have to look in the eyes of the monkeys every day. They have to pull that mouse box out and see there were three cannibalized pups in there.”\n\nCompared to care staff, none of the young scientists — grad students, postdocs, and research assistants — I spoke with felt that compassion fatigue was the best way to characterize their experience. It’s a subtle but crucial difference: While care workers face burnout from tending to unhappy animals in bleak spaces, researchers have to view the animals as tools to be used — and the researchers are the ones using them.\n\nResearchers are worn down by the pressure to treat animals as data points. A sick or uncooperative animal can derail months of work, jeopardizing their ability to graduate, publish papers, or compete for scarce academic jobs. Killing living things that you’ve intentionally distanced yourself from — while convincing yourself that it serves some greater utilitarian purpose — is part of the job.\n\n“And then you’re just supposed to go home and eat dinner and exist in your life, and not feel the impact of repeatedly taking someone’s life,” said Krasno. “It’s a highly traumatic field, but somehow, animal researchers get forgotten.”\n\nHow do we fix this?\n\nHowever entrenched animal research feels right now, the world of biomedical research is on the brink of massive change. Within decades, invasive research on lab animals could be obsolete, as new technology allows scientists to test cancer treatments on tissues grown from a patient’s own cells, or create detailed maps of Alzheimer’s disease in human brains.\n\n“Everyone recognizes that the goal is to eventually try to replace animals,” Naomi Charalambakis, the then-associate director of science policy at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the largest biomedical coalition in the US, told Scientific American last year.\n\nThe financial incentive to replace animal testing, too, is clear and compelling. Like keeping humans alive in prison, keeping animals alive in labs is incredibly expensive. Lab monkeys, which are in short supply, are especially costly, now selling for tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nAt this point, Jones-Engel believes it’s all but inevitable that animal testing will be phased out. It’s just a matter of when.\n\n“It’s not just that the writing’s on the wall,” she said. “The writing is like, plastered. It’s a giant neon sign saying ‘We’re done.’”\n\nBut the push to phase out animal testing depends on more than just greater efficiency — it calls for a reckoning with a legacy of harm. For the scientific community to truly evolve, it will need to confront its history and acknowledge the possibility of change. Helping animal researchers understand and grapple with their own experiences is a crucial first step.\n\nIt may be tempting to dismiss people who experiment on animals as villains who don’t deserve empathy or institutional support. Considering the well-being of those who cause harm for a living might feel incongruous, like imagining a peer support group for executioners. But new animal researchers often don’t know what they’re getting themselves into, and sometimes even choose to work in these labs because they love animals.\n\nMany institutions know this, so they require first-year grad students to complete several lab rotations, or trial runs where trainees typically spend two to three months in a handful of research groups, before committing to the team they’ll work with for the next few years. But not all programs offer such rotations, including programs where students could end up working with animals. They should.\n\nIt is also crucial that institutions have trustworthy systems in place for reporting workplace safety and animal welfare violations without fear of punishment, and with the option of anonymity.\n\nAnd lab workers also need to have faith that when they report violations, their campus’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), an internal body that oversees each university’s animal research, will take them seriously. Right now, though, these panels are strongly biased toward approving animal experiments. To signal a genuine commitment to animal welfare, institutions should rebalance IACUCs to include a greater percentage of members who aren’t affiliated with the university’s scientific research.\n\nAt bare minimum, institutions need to acknowledge the trauma they expose workers to and provide adequate mental health care for researchers. Simple measures like furnishing warm, naturally lit spaces for personal time and conversation during breaks — and protecting that break time — can make room for vulnerability in an otherwise sterile environment.\n\nUniversity counselors should be trained to help animal researchers navigate complex feelings of guilt, grief, and anxiety, without pressure to reconcile those feelings with any particular ethical stance. In parallel, senior scientists — many of whom were hired for their science chops, not their empathetic leadership — should be taught compassionate mentorship, and how to respond to challenging situations with empathy and tact. Principal investigators “don’t get enough training as it is on how to mentor and train others,” said Jocelyn Breton, a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University and soon-to-be neuroscience professor at Smith College.\n\nBreton has mentored many first-time animal researchers in the decade since she started working with mice and rats. “It’s really hard,” she tells her students, “and it doesn’t get easier.” Her current lab has a dedicated meeting every semester to discuss animal ethics and hold space for people to bring up concerns, and she checks in with her trainees frequently. Before exposing new students to animal death, she briefs them on what to expect. Afterward, she checks in, shares her own emotional experience, and gives students the freedom to set their own boundaries. Students have passed out watching perfusions, she told me, and some trainees quit. Creating a space where trainees feel comfortable choosing to leave is the point.\n\n“You have to strive to have an ethical identity”\n\nJohn Gluck, a research professor at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University who built his career on animal research, credits this kind of openness to dialogue with changing his mind about the use of animals in science. As a graduate student in the 1960s, before animal welfare laws were established in the US, he worked in psychologist Harry Harlow’s infamous monkey lab at UW Madison, where Madeline Krasno cleaned cages decades later. Gluck remembers researchers performing brain surgery with their bare hands and relatively limited experience. Animal welfare was an afterthought.\n\nSo, you’re feeling weird about animal research? After our video call, John Gluck emailed me a list of suggestions for other academics, particularly principal investigators of animal research labs, who are ready to start exploring their ambivalence about animal testing. Here are his suggestions, edited for length: Keep a private journal of moments when questions concerning the validity of animal testing emerge.\n\nSit in on relevant philosophy and ethics talks.\n\nIf you have not yet served on an IACUC, consider getting an appointment. Remain mostly quiet as you take in the process, and consider: Is it a process that screens questionable science, and protects experimental animals from misuse?\n\nMake time to meet with students and caregivers working with the animals in your studies. Have open conversations about their concerns, and reflect on your own comfort and openness during these conversations.\n\nEngage individuals from animal welfare groups and listen to their point of view.\n\nFreely observe the animals associated with your research, with no particular focus.\n\nLearn about the natural behavior of animals commonly used in your research.\n\nWith Harlow’s help, Gluck landed a tenure-track faculty job at the University of New Mexico, where he launched a monkey lab in Harlow’s image — exactly as he was expected to. In 1977, two years after philosopher Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation was published, his lab was attacked by animal rights activists, who released all of the monkeys living there. Gluck was incensed.\n\n“For years, my fury blocked the self-reflection that is expected of any scientist who harms vulnerable animals for presumed human benefit,” Gluck wrote in a 2011 letter to the scientific journal Nature. “I dismissed even reasonable ethical questions directed at me and my work.”\n\nBut over time, Gluck told me, conversations with students and veterinarians slowly opened his mind. Gluck took leave from his faculty job to immerse himself in a bioethics fellowship that ultimately convinced him to leave animal research behind. “What can I say? You just can’t keep publishing mistakes,” he said.\n\nScientists, including a younger Gluck, often dismiss animal welfare activists. He remembers one major scientist responding to protests by saying, “I’d have them all put in a psychiatric facility.” In conversations I’ve had with supporters of animal research, I’ve sensed a similar disdain, even fear, toward people working for organizations like PETA.\n\nBut Gluck says that animal researchers need to give them more credit, or at least actually talk to them: “We’re not listening.”\n\nI asked him what advice he would give to other scientists considering shifting their research model. “You have to strive to have an ethical identity,” he said. “Otherwise, what are you doing? You might as well be working in a bowling alley.”\n\nNot every scientist will, or needs to, make the same radical shift as Gluck did. But there is power in openness, and in loosening one’s grip on the way things have always been. And soon, scientists may be forced to confront the consequences of both the status quo and the sudden upheaval of their institutions by the Trump administration.\n\nThe future of biomedical research will depend on rebuilding and sustaining a thoughtful, empathetic workforce — and on our ability to ensure that discovery doesn’t come at the expense of those who make it possible.\n\nCorrection, March 6, 2025: A previous version of this story misstated the NIH’s funding going toward research projects involving animals. The Government Accountability Office reported NIH funding at about $5.5 billion annually; other estimates are higher.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court sent a rather unfortunate message during Monday’s argument in a racial gerrymandering dispute called Louisiana v. Callais: Do not trust us.\n\nTo understand where that message is coming from, it’s helpful to be familiar with a case the Court decided just two years ago that is nearly identical to Callais. In Allen v. Milligan (2023), the Court ruled that Alabama’s congressional maps violated the Voting Rights Act’s protections against racial gerrymandering, and that the state must draw an additional district with a Black majority to ensure Black citizens’ political power in the state wasn’t illegally diluted.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nNow the Callais case places Louisiana in the same shoes Alabama wore in Milligan. Louisiana’s own lawyers concede that Callais “presents the same question” as Millligan.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were the sort of institution that applies its own precedents in a consistent and predictable way, the outcome in Callais would be obvious. Since the Court recently decided a virtually identical case ordering the state of Alabama to draw a second Black-majority district, Louisiana should also be required to draw a second such district.\n\nIndeed, Louisiana appears to agree. After a legal battle, it eventually had its legislature draw new maps with two Black-majority districts.\n\nNevertheless, at Monday’s argument in Callais, all six of the Court’s Republicans suggested the Court does not care about its recent precedent: They all appeared to be looking for a way to strike down these new maps. Four of those justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett — dissented in Milligan, so their questions aren’t really surprising. But Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom joined the Milligan majority, also seemed highly skeptical of Louisiana’s new maps.\n\nMonday’s argument did create some uncertainty about whether Kavanaugh will block Louisiana’s new maps in this case — or whether he will wait until a different pending case reaches the Court before attempting a ruling that would blow up nearly four decades worth of voting rights law.\n\nKavanaugh has made it clear he’s not entirely sure that much of the Voting Rights Act is still necessary. In the Milligan case, Kavanaugh wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing that the Voting Rights Act’s protections against racial gerrymandering must have a sunset date, and he repeatedly asked questions about whether he should impose such a date in Callais. He did, however, suggest at one point that this question may need to wait until a later date — an outcome that could leave some of the Voting Rights Act’s anti-gerrymandering safeguards in place, for now.\n\nSo there is some uncertainty about whether, in the short term, the Court will strike down Louisiana’s new maps. However, all six of the Court’s Republicans appear eager to abandon a voting rights decision they handed down less than two years ago — and in the long run, that makes the durability of any decision the Court makes questionable.\n\nHow did this messy dispute wind up before the justices in the first place?\n\nCallais is actually one of two cases involving Louisiana’s congressional maps. Before the Callais case was even filed, a federal district judge ruled in another case, known as Robinson v. Ardoin, that Louisiana’s original maps (which had only one Black-majority district) violated the Voting Rights Act as it was interpreted in the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986).\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in the Robinson case since then. Indeed, the Supreme Court briefly put the Robinson litigation on ice while it considered the virtually identical dispute in Milligan. Ultimately, however, Milligan rejected Alabama’s arguments that the Court should effectively overrule Gingles and replace it with a new rule that would make racial gerrymandering suits under the Voting Rights Act virtually impossible to win.\n\nThen, after the Court decided Milligan, a federal appeals court agreed that the original maps at issue in Robinson are illegal. At that point, the state decided to give up the fight, convene its legislature, and draw new maps that complied with the Robinson order.\n\nOrdinarily, that would be the end of the dispute. The state had its chance to defend its old maps. It lost in multiple courts. And it made the entirely rational decision not to litigate the case any further because the Supreme Court had already signaled that it should lose in Milligan.\n\nBut then a new set of plaintiffs challenged the state’s new maps (this is the Callais case) arguing that the state violated the Constitution because it paid too much attention to race when it drew the new maps. The state absolutely did consider race when it drew those maps — it had to draw two Black-majority districts based on the Robinson court order — but the Supreme Court held in Cooper v. Harris (2017) that a state may engage in “race-based districting” when it has “a strong basis in evidence” for concluding it must do so to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThere’s no question that Louisiana had a strong basis to conclude that it had to draw a second Black-majority district when it drew its new maps, as two federal courts had ordered them to do so. But two members of the three-judge panel that heard Callais, the ones appointed by Donald Trump, nevertheless struck down Louisiana’s new maps. That left the state trapped between two competing court orders, one that forbids them from using the old maps, and another forbidding them from using the new maps.\n\nNow that Callais is before the Supreme Court, the only question that is legitimately before the justices is whether a state may comply with a court order requiring it to draw two Black-majority districts by drawing two Black-majority districts. Because the state decided not to continue fighting the lower courts’ conclusions in Robinson, the justices should not have the authority to question what happened in that case.\n\nBut that didn’t stop many of the Court’s Republicans from trying to relitigate Robinson. Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch all peppered the lawyers defending Louisiana’s new maps with questions about whether, in Thomas’s words, the Court must accept Robinson “as a given.” (The correct answer to Thomas’s question is “yes.”)\n\nThe Milligan dissenters already made their views clear when that case was decided, so Callais is unlikely to turn on their votes. The question is whether either Roberts or Kavanaugh have had a change of heart since Milligan was decided only two years ago. Many of their questions suggest that they have.\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh appear eager to blow up four decades of voting rights law\n\nRelated How America lost its commitment to the right to vote\n\nKavanaugh’s suggestion that racial civil rights laws must sunset at some point, for example, derives from Roberts’s majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which concluded that a key provision of the Voting Rights Act is now unconstitutional because the United States was less racist in 2013 than it was in the 1960s.\n\nThough Roberts asked few questions during the Callais argument, the handful of questions he did ask suggests that he wants to toss out Louisiana’s new maps. At one point, for example, he joined the Thomas/Alito/Gorsuch bloc in questioning whether Robinson was correctly decided. At another point, he suggested that the new maps are illegal because one of the districts resembles a “snake.”\n\nIt is true that the Supreme Court has said that, during cases like Robinson, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that it is possible to draw an additional majority-minority district that is reasonably compact. But the plaintiffs met that burden while Robinson was being litigated. The state says that the legislature chose not to use the plaintiffs’ more compact maps when it drew the new districts because it wanted to protect a Republican incumbent who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.\n\nUnder existing law, the state is allowed to draw an uglier map than the one that was under consideration in Robinson. Indeed, the Court’s gerrymandering decisions emphasize that “redistricting is ‘primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.’” So Louisiana should have been allowed to draw any map it wants, provided that it complied with the Robinson order.\n\nStill, Roberts’s skeptical questions about the snake-like district imply that he is looking for a reason to strike the new maps down.\n\nKavanaugh, meanwhile, repeatedly brought up his claim in Milligan that the Voting Rights Act’s anti-gerrymandering safeguards need an expiration date. He did, however, acknowledge that this issue was not raised by the Callais plaintiffs until fairly late in this litigation, and that there is another case making its way through the court system which raises this sunsetting issue more directly. So Kavanaugh may vote to uphold Louisiana’s new maps, with the understanding that he could potentially eliminate much of the Voting Rights Act once that other case reaches his Court.\n\nEven if Kavanaugh does stay his hand in Callais, however, that won’t be enough to save Louisiana’s new maps. If Roberts joins the four Milligan dissenters, that’s a majority.\n\nUltimately, if Louisiana’s maps are struck down, one of the biggest losers will be the fairly basic proposition that the law should operate in a predictable way. Because of the Republican justices’ longstanding skepticism of the Voting Rights Act, few close observers of the Court expected it to do what it did in Milligan. But the ink on the Milligan opinion is barely dry, and lawyers and lawmakers should be able to rely on a Supreme Court decision that is less than two years old — especially given the fact that no member of the Milligan majority has left the Court.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nStudents walk through a nearly empty Columbia University campus after police cleared out a Gaza protest encampment on May 6, 2024, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe second Trump administration has shown remarkable aggression in abruptly canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants at elite universities — in an effort to force them to make major policy changes in line with the president’s politics.\n\nThat’s likely just the start. They’ve threatened dozens of other schools. And the National Institutes for Health (NIH) is also trying to change its research funding formula in a way that would hit elite universities particularly hard.\n\nThe administration’s demands on these schools include cracking down on protesters of Israel’s war in Gaza, disallowing trans women athletes from women’s sports teams, and ending the practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in admissions and campus life. For Columbia, Trump officials even demanded the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies department be taken out of the hands of its current leadership — a threat to academic freedom from the state.\n\nAll this fits into a larger strategy. Right-wingers have increasingly come to believe that elite universities are one of the main incubators of “woke” cultural progressivism; that, by advancing left-wing ideas about various issues and socializing young Americans into believing them, they help progressives dominate the culture.\n\nWinning the culture war, they believe, requires a more aggressive attack on elite universities — to hurt them, and to coerce them into being more sympathetic to the right.\n\nAnd Trump officials believe the tens of billions of dollars in research funding the federal government provides to academic institutions gives them leverage to make this happen.\n\nThey are apparently correct in this belief. On Friday, Columbia agreed to give in to various demands Trump officials had made, including giving campus police new powers to arrest student protesters and taking its Middle Eastern studies department away from its current leadership. (Trump officials have not yet said they’ll restore the revoked $400 million.)\n\nAll this comes at a cost to the nation. One key reason Republican presidents haven’t tried anything like this before: This research funding is largely for scientific and medical research, generally not for “woke” or political stuff. Until recently, there was bipartisan agreement that such research funds shouldn’t be used to play political games. Now, though, it’s being used as a weapon in the right’s war against the left.\n\n“I think that putting the universities into contraction, into a recession, into declining budgets, into a greater competitive market pressure, would discipline them,” conservative activist Christopher Rufo said recently. He wanted to threaten federal funding to universities, he said, to put them “in an existential terror.” Which is exactly what’s happening.\n\nHow elite universities came to rely on federal funding — and how conservatives realized this was leverage\n\nAs World War II made the US a global superpower and the Cold War pitted it against the Soviet Union, the federal government provided a huge commitment of research funds to try to make the US the global leader in science and technology. Much of that funding went to higher education institutions, funding for labs, experiments, and other studies from university-affiliated researchers. (Student loans, meanwhile, became another hugely important source of federal funds to universities.)\n\nFor nearly as long, elite universities have drawn the ire of conservatives who have argued that they’re poisoning the minds of America’s youth with their far-left ways, while being intolerant toward the right. For instance, when protests over the Vietnam War and other social justice issues dominated campuses in the late 1960s and early 1970s, President Richard Nixon seethed in the Oval Office: “The professors are the enemy. Professors are the enemy. Write that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it.”\n\nThough Nixon’s administration and state governments wanted new laws punishing universities, “few of these measures passed and fewer were enforced,” historian Ellen Schrecker has written. Further national controversies in which conservatives were angry about happenings at elite universities also tended to fizzle out.\n\nOver the past decade, though, elite universities have become increasingly central to the right’s narrative about what ails America — and conservatives have gotten more serious about trying to do something about it.\n\nMany on the right have spent much of the past decade seething about the Great Awokening — the leftward move of the culture around race, gender, and sexuality in the mid-to-late 2010s.\n\nIncidents at colleges and universities involving the alleged mistreatment of conservatives or people with non-left views got attention in the national media, and similar controversies soon unfolded across American society.\n\nInfluential voices on the right argued that “wokeness” was in large part created by elite universities. Rufo, for instance, argued that it was the evolution of a legal scholarship school known as “critical race theory,” and that to defeat it, conservatives needed to go after elite universities.\n\nThe blogger Curtis Yarvin, meanwhile, had argued for years that progressives dominated the country’s culture because of “the Cathedral” — elite academic and media institutions that, in his telling, set the bounds of acceptable political discourse and distort reality to fit their preferred ideological frames.\n\nSuch explanations like these seemed to ring true to those on the right frustrated by the leftward cultural shift. It named a specific enemy that could be fought against, as part of a strategy for gaining cultural power for the right.\n\nSo by 2021, then-Senate candidate (and Yale Law School alum) JD Vance was arguing that conservatives “have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” So much “of what drives truth and knowledge as we understand it in this country,” Vance said, is fundamentally determined by universities who are “very hostile” to the right. Why, he asked, had conservatives accepted that state of affairs? Wasn’t it time to do something about it?\n\nWhy the second Trump administration finally went through with trying to defund universities\n\nThe idea of pulling federal research funding from universities due to excessive wokeness was kicking around during the first Trump administration. Trump even signed an executive order that he claimed would do this back in 2019. But this turned out to be mostly toothless. The appetite to punish universities was not yet so strong to make it really happen.\n\nIn the early 2020s, though, the right’s backlash against academia intensified further, due to new controversies.\n\nThe second Trump administration is far more willing to bend — and blatantly break — the law, to try and get what they want.\n\nPart of this was specifically a backlash against the medical establishment. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the right’s distrust of scientists and public health experts deepened, due to vaccine skepticism and other controversies. So putting medical research funding at risk no longer seemed so unthinkable to them; indeed, it was arguably desirable.\n\nAs secretary of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now oversees much of this research spending through the NIH. Kennedy and his allies seem not just willing but downright eager to take a wrecking ball to the medical research status quo. ($250 million of the frozen $400 million in Columbia funds was NIH funding.)\n\nMeanwhile, a separate backlash began, in response to campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. Many students and faculty members supported the protests, but others — including major donors — opposed them, and argued Jewish students had become newly unsafe on campus. Trump took this up as a cause: His threats to Columbia came through his new “Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.”\n\nA final reason this attack on universities is happening now is that the second Trump administration is far more willing to bend — and blatantly break — the law, to try and get what they want.\n\nThe revocation of Columbia’s funds, analysts have said, is illegal. Cornell Law School professor Michael Dorf wrote that the federal government can cut off funding to punish civil rights violations, but only after a lengthy process. Instead, perhaps inspired by Elon Musk’s “move fast and break the law” approach, Trump officials just went ahead and did it.\n\nWhere’s the pushback?\n\nAll this seems to be working out quite well for the administration so far, as universities appear to be conceding to their demands.\n\nSome schools are being proactive: The University of California announced last week that it would drop mandatory diversity statements from its hiring process.\n\nAnd despite the seeming illegality of Trump revoking Columbia’s funds, the school didn’t sue in court to try and stop it. Columbia instead opted to seek an agreement with Trump officials. Per the Wall Street Journal’s Douglas Belkin, the university feared that a court fight would simply spur Trump’s team to find other legal avenues to take back those or other funds. (Columbia receives far more in federal funding that wasn’t yet revoked.)\n\nSo it seems that Trump officials and right-wing activists really did figure out how to effectively use federal funds as leverage to coerce universities. Such cuts would be devastating and universities deeply want to avoid them.\n\nBut Belkin’s Columbia sources cited another reason for the school’s concession: The school’s leadership also “believed there was considerable overlap between needed campus changes and Trump’s demands.”\n\nSo university trustees and administrators, according to this reporting, believed the Gaza war protests had gone too far and needed to be reined in. At least in part, they were using Trump’s demands as an excuse to make changes they wanted to make anyway.\n\nThis is part of a broader dynamic, in which many elites formerly sympathetic to left causes — or at least unwilling to fight them — have turned against the left. Many progressives, meanwhile, seem exhausted and disillusioned, and are no longer fighting back with much fervor. It isn’t the first Trump administration anymore, when social justice activists felt the arc of history was bending in their direction.",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set.

Previously, she wrote for the Daily Beast and contributed to several publications, including Vulture, W Magazine, and Bitch Media.\n\nFor decades, medical dramas have been a comforting staple of television, reliable entertainment without the expectations of being groundbreaking or necessarily good. Suddenly, this genre has become a rejuvenating force in a dying landscape, thanks to two new offerings, ABC’s Doctor Odyssey and Max’s The Pitt. Both shows are generating actual conversation, attachment to characters, and anticipation for upcoming episodes. That these shows are wringing new life out of the genre that gave us ER is just one of the indicators that people are finally excited about TV again.\n\nIt’s strange to think that TV could be in need of a “comeback.” For decades, you could come home from work, sit on your coach, and enjoy a show that you could chat about the next day with your friends and colleagues. Nowadays, this experience feels more like a luxury. “Prestige” TV is seemingly on its way out, with big shows appearing and flopping before viewers can even register their existence. Meanwhile, the only televised drama people seem eager to talk about is happening on reality shows like The Traitors and Love Is Blind.\n\nFor the first time in a while, though, you can go online and sense what shows people are actually engaged with and not just mindlessly consuming. Along with Doctor Odyssey and The Pitt, there have been plenty of social media chatter surrounding series like Hulu’s presidential drama Paradise and Netflix’s romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This, which premiered last fall. The flailing prestige arena even has a few bright spots, with the third installment of White Lotus and the recently completed second season of Severance being huge talkers.\n\nOn paper, most of these shows aren’t particularly flashy or unique (okay, except for Severance). In fact, they sound like the hackneyed ideas of some uninspired network executives, from their recycled premises to their familiar casting. Yet their popularity reflects an exhaustion brought on by the streaming era and how isolated the TV-watching experience has become.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like the days of watching TV at a collective pace and falling in love with characters over a long stretch of time were gone. However, it seems like a change in consumption is upon us.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

It wasn’t just that new shows and streamers were appearing — and disappearing — at a fast rate. Suddenly, series like Stranger Things and, later, Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power were requiring Marvel-sized budgets to produce. It took the Covid-19 pandemic for the system to really collapse, with shows getting canceled en masse to keep the rest of the industry afloat and recoup financially.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the enjoyment factor of TV was becoming lost amid streaming’s lofty ambitions. Creators weren’t just aiming for the quality of storytelling demonstrated by iconic series like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men. Many shows were aiming to be a lot weirder, more cinematic, and intellectually challenging.\n\nThis didn’t always result in good TV-making. In some cases, the more unorthodox the show, the less suited it seemed for serialization.\n\nTake, for instance, the FX comedy-drama Atlanta, which was lauded for its funny and incisive one-off episodes in its first two seasons. The show eventually took one too many narrative departures. By the time the series ended in 2022, it was hard to define the plot of the show, let alone the arc of its characters. Another popular show that suffered from its attempts at avant-garde is the Max series Euphoria. Its first season was structured less like an episodic series and more like a set of hyperstylized vignettes set around each of the show’s characters. Season two felt even more fragmented and plotless. Apparently, this loss of direction contributed to Euphoria’s third season experiencing delays.\n\nFrom left, Barbie Ferreira, Alexa Demie, and Sydney Sweeney in Euphoria, season two. Max\n\nThe Bear also has demonstrated how breaking the conventions of TV can cause a show to run out of gas. In a review of season three, Jack Hamilton wrote in Slate that the innovative narrative devices in The Bear’s first season — flashbacks, long takes, and montage sequences — had become “gimmicky and tryhard.”\n\nThis isn’t just the failure of writers and creators. If scripted shows these days don’t feel built ripe for longevity, it’s also because networks and streamers haven’t been allowing them to thrive. In addition to shows being canceled early, the binge model and the speed at which viewers can blow through an entire season of television can create a sense of amnesia regarding what even aired throughout the year. These shows, with four to eight episodes all dropped at once, hardly take up any brain space after you’ve finished watching them. Nor do they inspire long-term conversation with other people, who may well not be watching at the same pace or time. Amazon’s highly anticipated Mr. and Mrs. Smith limited series highlighted this dilemma last year. Despite earning positive reviews and featuring two beloved TV stars in Donald Glover and Maya Erskine, it inspired surprisingly minimal discourse on social media.\n\nHigh concepts are out. Fun, nostalgic, TV is in.\n\nAnd yet, in this desiccated landscape, a new wave of oddly familar scripted programming is sparking much needed engagement. One of these shows is The Pitt, which premiered in January on Max. The show has been described as a rehash of ER, right down to its casting of Noah Wyle — who played Dr. John Carter on the former NBC series — as the show’s hunky doctor. Wyle now plays Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, an ER physician with Covid overseeing an eclectic group of doctors and medical students. Each episode takes place over one hour of a 15-hour shift, in a format similar to the Fox show 24.\n\nDespite the fact that each episode is an hour-long circus of fractured limbs, bizarre medical mysteries, and tragic death, it’s managed to become comfort viewing for its eager fan base on X. Viewers seem particularly invested in the show’s ensemble of charming and extremely familiar archetypes — the dorky, anxious medical student, the tough intern with a dark past, the steady doctor navigating issues with her still-secret pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, another show about a hunky doctor played by a beloved TV actor has become a smash hit in its first season. The Ryan Murphy-produced Doctor Odyssey stars Dawson’s Creek’s Joshua Jackson as Dr. Max Bankman, a newly hired physician on a luxury cruise ship called The Odyssey. He works alongside two nurses, and the three of them form a love triangle that eventually becomes a messy throuple. In a format similar to Murphy’s Glee, the episodes are structured by the cruise’s themed weeks — Wellness Week, Gay Week, etc. In an apparent ode to The Love Boat, it features a bunch of delightful guests, like Shania Twain and John Stamos, who provide the show’s ridiculous “sea-mergencies.”\n\nFrom left, Joshua Jackson, Adrianne Palicki, Phillipa Soo, and Sean Teale in season one of Doctor Odyssey. Tina Tharpe/Disney\n\nSomehow, both medical dramas are nostalgic and refreshing. Their week-to-week scheduling brings back a traditional cadence of consuming TV, one that encourages prolonged conversation and emotional attachment to characters. There’s also the excitement of seeing familiar (and attractive) faces in protagonist roles.\n\nOther popular shows right now seem to be benefiting from this clever casting. The recently concluded first season of Paradise stars two of TV’s most beloved dudes: This Is Us actor Sterling K. Brown and Jury Duty’s James Marsden, as a Secret Service agent and president, respectively, in unusual circumstances. The Hulu show was such a success, it’s coming to ABC in April. Meanwhile, Nobody Wants This, starring The O.C.’s Adam Brody and Veronica Mars star Kristen Bell, was practically millennial fan fiction. The show rose up the streaming charts, and was quickly renewed.\n\nMost significantly, these new shows are purposefully fun, prioritizing action, drama, and compelling relationships. That said, it’s maybe not a coincidence that the few “prestige” shows audiences are invested in right now are The White Lotus and Severance. While these shows feature social commentary and — particularly in the case of Severance — subversive storytelling, they largely traffic in suspense and mystery, keeping viewers on their toes week by week.\n\nLike all cultural trends, it was only a matter of time before the pendulum swung the other way. The next great era of TV might just be what streaming has been trying to change all along.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "The finding, released this week, relies on data from the American Time Use Survey and shows that in 2023 about one in four Americans ate all of their meals alone the previous day, an increase of 53 percent since 2003. The analysis also found that eating meals solo, including at home or out at a restaurant, has become more common in all age groups, but most pronounced among those under 35.\n\n“The extent to which one shares meals,” says Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Oxford and co-editor of the World Happiness Report, “is an extraordinary proxy for measuring people’s social connections and their social capital. It underpins people’s social support. It drives prosocial behaviors, and all of that, in turn, leads it to be a very strong indicator — predictor — for people’s life satisfaction.”\n\nEconomic factors, like high income and employment status, are often used as indicators of happiness. But researchers found the ritual of sharing meals to be an even more effective indicator of general well-being than job status and salary. “That surprised us as a research team,” De Neve says.\n\nThe most obvious driver of solo dining is the rise of solo living. The share of single-person households in the US has steadily increased since the 1940s, when just under 8 percent of homes were occupied by one individual. By 2020, that number had grown to 27 percent. But even those who cohabitate choose to eat their meals alone. In 2023, about 18 percent of Americans who lived with others ate all of their meals alone the day prior, the report found, compared to 12 percent in 2003 — a 50 percent increase.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

As social media and smartphones became more entrenched in the 2010s, the less often people shared meals with others. (De Neve has no explanation for the spike in solo dining in 2011.)\n\nResearch shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities.\n\nThe finding also points to increasingly individualistic habits. Solitary pursuits branded as “self-care” may have led to increased isolation. The top reason cited by those who considered eating alone in restaurants in 2024 was to get more “me time,” according to consumer research polling from OpenTable and Kayak.\n\nThe rise of solo dining has implications beyond the table. Research shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities. Increased social isolation meanwhile can lead to feelings of loneliness, which, in turn, can lead to cardiovascular health risks and increased feelings of depression, risk, and anxiety.\n\nOn a broader scale, loneliness and solitary tendencies breed distrust, which has profound consequences for the state of civil society. The simple act of sharing a meal with a colleague or friend can help bridge divides and increase well-being.",

        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nLate in Hulu’s new series Good American Family comes a moment of irony that’s become all too familiar in true crime docudramas. The fictionalized Natalia Grace Barnett — at this point in the story a teen, being played by the 27-year-old Imogen Faith Reid — glowingly reads supportive comments from random internet strangers. “I feel so bad I doubted you, Natalia,” one comment reads, “but I guess that’s what the media wanted.”\n\nAh, yes: the ancient narrative that the media made a complicated situation worse, being proffered by a piece of media that’s currently making it worse.\n\nGood American Family dramatizes the twisted saga of Natalia Grace, a Ukraine-born adoptee who was born in 2003, 1989, or somewhere in between, according to a litany of contradicting stories and court records. The new series’ interminable eight episodes rehash the saga many Americans first learned about in 2019, when her second set of adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, gained media attention for adopting and then abandoning her in the US when they moved to Canada without her. The Barnetts publicly claimed that their daughter was an evil, murderous 20-something con artist pretending to be a little girl.\n\nYes, it’s the plot of the movie Orphan, but in real life. (To be clear, Natalia Grace’s tale did not inspire the 2009 movie, as she was adopted in 2010, but may well have been inspired by it.) The Barnetts’ behavior resulted in ultimately unsuccessful criminal charges of neglect. Though the messy details of this back and forth are recounted for viewers, including the accompanying media spectacle, the Hulu series ultimately does little to justify itself, either as entertainment or as a further examination of an abuse victim whose entire life has been lived under a magnifying glass as a result of her abuse.\n\nHere’s what to know about the saga of Natalia — and why the Hulu docuseries probably isn’t the last time you’ll be hearing her name, even though it probably should be.\n\nNatalia was 6 or 7 — or maybe 8 or 9 — when she was adopted in 2010\n\nBy their own telling, Indiana residents Kristine and Michael Barnett and their three sons were an all-American family: Kristine would go on to author a much-lauded book about raising her son Jacob, who is a high-functioning child prodigy. The memoir, The Spark, was so popular it was nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award in 2013 — but while it details Kristine Barnett’s miraculous job parenting her sons, it reportedly contains no mention whatsoever of the little girl she adopted alongside them.\n\nThe Barnetts adopted Natalia in 2010. According to Michael Barnett, they were only given 24 hours by a shady adoption agency to make a decision about adopting her, and were provided very little information about Natalia’s background and medical history. What we know is that Natalia’s birth mother had been born in Latvia and was living in Ukraine at the time of Natalia’s birth, which was listed on Natalia’s birth certificate as September 4, 2003. She placed Natalia in an orphanage. In 2008, at the age of 5, she was brought to the US by Dyan and Gary Ciccone, a New Hampshire couple with ties to an area adoption agency focused on Russian adoptees. What happened is unclear, but Natalia’s unsuccessful placement underscores the often murky and dysfunctional process of adoption, especially international adoptions, which can exploit children.\n\nImogen Faith Reid, Ellen Pompeo, and Mark Duplass in Good American Family. Disney/Ser Baffo\n\nThe Barnetts immediately ran into problems with the adoption. They claimed that Natalia, who was born with dwarfism, was showing signs of puberty, including menstruation and pubic hair, despite being only 6 or 7 according to her official birth certificate. They also claimed that Natalia had tried repeatedly to kill them, including by placing thumbtacks on the stairs, pouring Pine Sol into coffee, wielding knives, and allegedly pulling Kristine Barnett into an electric fence. According to Michael Barnett, their response to these incidents included begging the police to arrest their 7-year-old; police declined. Child services were alerted to the situation, however, and began investigating the couple’s treatment of their daughter. During the same period, the Barnetts had Natalia seen by various medical experts, apparently in attempts to determine her “real” age. Medical providers in the Barnetts’ lives have since come forward to allege that they told the Barnetts Natalia was a child.\n\nTo this day, it’s not fully clear whether the Barnetts actually believed their own lie about Natalia being an adult, or whether they just made it up as an excuse to be rid of her. Kristine Barnett has fallen back on the medical advice she claims she was given by experts, while Michael Barnett has emphasized the court rulings concerning her age; the new Hulu docuseries depicts him as being manipulated by Kristine’s own narcissism, though not without culpability.\n\nIn 2012, the Barnetts successfully petitioned a probate court to change Natalia’s official birth year from 2003 to 1989, which made her legally 22 years old instead of 8. According to court documents, the change was made “based on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and a social worker,” without holding an evidentiary hearing or providing Natalia with her own legal representative in the matter. This also meant that the child services case was closed, since Natalia was now legally an adult.\n\nAround the time of this ruling, Natalia spent nine weeks in a mental hospital. She also spent time at a halfway house. The Barnetts rented two subsequent apartments for her, including one in Lafayette, Indiana — a decision made, according to court testimony from a state police detective, “Because Kristine said Lafayette is a white-trash town and nobody is going to care or worry about [Natalia].” The Barnetts also appeared to disbelieve that the physical disabilities associated with Natalia’s medical condition were real; though she had used a walker since she was a child, the apartment they rented for her was on the second floor of a house with no easy street access. After relocating Natalia to this isolated, inaccessible house in Lafayette, the Barnetts moved to Canada with their sons in 2013, leaving her behind. Natalia never saw Kristine Barnett again.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2014 — but their entanglement with Natalia was only just beginning.\n\nThe courts perpetuate a wrong and then fail to redress it\n\nFollowing her abandonment by the Barnetts in 2013, Natalia was taken in by Cynthia and Antwon Mans and their children. (Some reports say the Mans have 10 children, others say five.) Over the next decade, Natalia and others tried repeatedly to have her age change reversed in the courts, only for the courts to reaffirm that she was an adult. Natalia was legally considered an adult for most of her childhood. At one point, per court records, the Mans attempted to gain legal guardianship over Natalia, only for Michael Barnett to block their efforts because, he claimed, Natalia was an adult.\n\n“All I was told was, ‘You’re 22 now,’” Natalia later told ID’s multiseason docuseries about the saga, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. “‘Whenever somebody asks you what your age is, you say you’re 22 and you tried to murder your family.’ I was taught to lie.”\n\nProsecutors soon became interested in Natalia’s case. Confusion over Natalia’s actual age began to dominate the investigation into the Barnetts’ behavior, which was serious enough that they were each charged separately in 2019 with criminal counts related to both child neglect and neglect of a dependent [adult]. The child neglect charges were ultimately dismissed due to the outstanding quandary of her age.\n\nIn 2023, a DNA lab conducted testing that seemed to conclusively put the matter of Natalia’s age to rest: She was likely around two years older than the age indicated by her birth certificate at the time of her adoption, born around 2001. At the time of her adoption, she would have been 8 or 9, and at the time of her abandonment in Lafayette, she would have been 11 or 12 — not 23, as the court system legally claimed.\n\nBut because the original court ruling still stood, in 2020, prosecutors had to drop all charges related to child neglect. At Michael Barnett’s 2022 trial for neglect of a dependent adult, Natalia testified against her adopted father. She alleged that she had fallen repeatedly while attempting to navigate her inaccessible apartment, and that the Barnetts had left her to fend for herself without teaching her how to access her disability payments or perform basic tasks like laundry or food preparation.\n\nMichael Barnett’s lawyer, however, was able to successfully allege that at 23 — the only age Natalia was legally permitted to acknowledge under the court ruling — she should have been able to do all of those tasks as a functioning adult. Defense attorneys also implied that the Mans family were manipulating and exploiting Natalia — allegations of stealing benefits that would linger after the trial. Jurors ultimately found Michael Barnett not guilty on the neglect charge, and the pending charges against Kristine Barnett were subsequently dropped.\n\nFrom there, despite the mudslinging, it seemed as though things were finally resolved between Natalia and the Barnetts. By that point, however, the Barnetts, Natalia, and the Mans were something more than a set of dysfunctional squabbling families — they were all reality stars.\n\nFrom one messy situation to another\n\nIn late 2019, the news of criminal charges laid against the Barnetts began to make headlines, and the lives of all involved irrevocably changed. Tabloid media quickly labeled Natalia a “‘Psycho’ dwarf,” and Natalia and the Mans family went on Dr. Phil — and all of this was within weeks of the story coming to light.\n\nThen came ID’s multiseason docuseries, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, which began airing in 2023 shortly after the court proceedings. By that point, Natalia was living with the Mans family, who the docuseries framed as her saviors. The Mans, who claimed Natalia had never been dangerous at all, formally adopted her in 2023 — when she was around 21 — in a splashy event that made up part of the show’s second season.\n\nThe pressure to provide TV drama may have been too much for the Mans family, however. Despite caring for Natalia for nearly a decade without issues, they abruptly dramatically leaned into the “Natalia is evil” theme, with Antwon Mans calling the show’s producers to allege that her behavior had been disturbing and selfish. The ID producers, naturally, revealed this development as a shocking twist and a season-ending cliffhanger.\n\nIn the documentary’s third season, Natalia accused the Mans family of physical and emotional abuse. To the Hollywood Reporter, ID president Jason Sarlanis described the docuseries’ decision to delve into Natalia’s time with the Mans as “do[ing] right by our audience” — whether anyone considered doing right by Natalia and her new family dynamic was less clear.\n\nIn 2023, Natalia left the Mans family’s Nashville residence and moved in with yet another family: The DePauls, a family of little people who reportedly wanted to adopt Natalia all the way back in 2009, prior to her adoption by the Barnetts. The ID series filmed them helping Natalia dramatically “escape” from the Mans in the middle of the night, into a new wholesome life with a family who hopefully could finally understand her.\n\nA happy ending? Yes and no. While there’s little left to say about Natalia’s story at this point, it’s clearly going to keep going in the public eye. In January 2025, People placed now 23-year-old Natalia on the cover, with the lurid headline “Victim or Villain?” even though years of reporting within its own pages make the answer abundantly clear. Hulu’s Good American Family similarly plays with blaming a disabled child for her own abuse. On top of that, the show drags out over eight episodes and features a parade of flat, dull characters. Ellen Pompeo as Kristine is especially one-note, narcissistic and brittle with little nuance, while Mark Duplass as Michael goes through a histrionic and unbelievable series of emotional swings as he wrestles with who to believe. The Mans are depicted as well-meaning grifters who rescue Natalia but aren’t without their own issues.\n\nThough it ultimately fully accepts the framing that the Barnetts emotionally and physically abused and gaslit Natalia to a heartbreaking degree, it also initially perpetuates the idea that Natalia’s behavior is alarming and disturbing. Above all, casting 27-year-old Reid to play a child 20 years younger at the time the series starts does more to confuse the narrative than clarify it. While the narrative depicts Natalia as finding closure, it’s hard not to see the show leaving the door open for another season, just as ID has done again and again.\n\nWhat’s more, Nicole DePaul recently alleged on Facebook that the docudrama had not compensated Natalia in any way for the use of her story — though they were, she claimed, compensating Kristine Barnett, perhaps in the hopes of staving off a lawsuit. (Hulu did not respond for comment.)\n\n\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time that a high-profile true crime docudrama has been castigated for exploiting victims. But instead of learning any lessons from those other cases, or even from Natalia’s own story, it seems we’re destined to repeat these same mistakes in the quest for drama — with diminishing returns.",

They argue for embracing a politics of abundance that encourages building and innovation and unlocks American prosperity, aiming for a future of “more” rather than “less” for everyone.\n\nThompson and Klein are self-identified liberals, and their book is mainly meant to diagnose what they see has gone wrong with Democratic governance in recent decades, as progressives have consciously adopted policies that aim to put limits on growth. They point to the examples of Democratic cities like San Francisco or New York, where regulations have made it virtually impossible to build new living spaces, putting the cost of housing out of reach for more and more people.\n\nEven on issues that Democrats care deeply about, like climate change, their policies have inadvertently had the effect of slowing progress by making it difficult to build out the vast amount of clean energy needed to reduce carbon emissions without hurting the economy.\n\nRelated\n\nThe result was that even as technological progress continued, we stopped feeling it and we stopped appreciating it — a consistent theme of this newsletter. Instead, bit by bit, and often with the best intentions, we put countless invisible brakes on development, with the net result that we reduced the supply and raised the price of the goods that we needed for a good life. And once we lost the ability to build physically, we lost the ability to build a better future.\n\nAbundance isn’t just for Democrats\n\nGiven how much of Abundance focuses on where Democrats went wrong, the book has ignited debate among progressives. If you want to read more about that but don’t want to get lost in endless post threads or three-hour-long podcasts, my Vox colleague Eric Levitz has a great piece on the arguments and why Democrats should heed the message of Abundance.\n\nBut it’s a mistake to think of Abundance as a book that has meaning only for readers who vote blue. At its heart is a message that matters for Americans of all political backgrounds: we don’t have to fight endlessly over who gets what piece of a shrinking pie. For far too long we’ve let ourselves be convinced that we have to treat American life as a zero-sum game, but we can change the rules. We can embrace policies that actively grow that pie — policies that make housing more affordable in the places people want to live, that give us energy to power a high-tech economy without burning up the planet, that bring us better health care at lower costs.\n\nThompson and Klein recognize that Americans will never agree on everything, that there are issues where there are simply fundamental differences between the right and the left. But they’re right to argue that most Americans want a better life for themselves and their children, and that a politics focused on improving material progress in the areas that matter — housing, education, energy — is one that can appeal to almost everyone. As Thompson wrote in the Atlantic this week, abundance can “combine the progressive virtue of care for the working class and a traditionally conservative celebration of national greatness.”\n\nIf we can do that, we might just be able to break the polarization that has gridlocked progress and turned American politics into a winner-takes-all death match.\n\nI’m sure not everyone who reads Abundance will agree with every page. Diagnosing the mistakes that have held back progress is a lot easier than creating a political movement that can unlock it. But I do believe there is a hunger in this country for a vision of the future that isn’t inherently fearful, that recaptures something of the optimism that was once synonymous with America. That gives me hope at a moment when we desperately need it.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. Sign up here!",

Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to The Logoff: Today Joshua Keating and I are focusing on top Trump administration officials accidentally messaging a journalist with their plans for bombing Yemen. It’s a bizarre story — and one with longstanding implications for our European allies’ ability to trust us with sensitive information.\n\nWait, what? The Atlantic revealed today that a top Trump official accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. With Goldberg reading, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, policy adviser Stephen Miller, and others discussed a potential attack on military targets in Yemen, where a group called the Houthis has been disrupting global trade by attacking passing ships.\n\nThen, days later, Goldberg says, Hegseth messaged the group with extraordinarily sensitive and detailed information about the planned US strikes, which took place hours after Hegseth’s message.\n\n\n\nThat sounds made up. How do we know the chat isn’t fake? A spokesperson for the administration confirmed its authenticity.\n\nJust how big of a mistake is this? It’s a major protocol violation to discuss sensitive military operations on a group chat. Such conversations are held in secure facilities where cell phones are typically banned.\n\nIs it illegal? The Atlantic reports that the official who invited Goldberg, national security adviser Michael Waltz, may have violated multiple parts of the Espionage Act. It’s hard to imagine the Trump administration prosecuting him, however.\n\nSo what’s the big picture? Arguably, the officials got lucky they added Goldberg, who withheld certain details of the messages in the name of national security. But already wary US allies — concerned about Trump’s friendliness toward Russia and hostility toward NATO — could have even more reason to feel wary about the information they share with this administration.\n\nThe Logoff The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

But at least one demographic of people are having the best sex of their lives: Gen X women. At least that’s the argument writer Mireille Silcoff makes in her most recent piece in the New York Times magazine.\n\nIn it, she explores her own middle-aged sexual awakening. “I was trying to explain a moment that I was really seeing everywhere,” she told Vox. Between her own life, her friends’ experiences, and the portrayals in pop culture that were popping up everywhere, she sensed a trend emerging. “There seems to be something new in the air having to do with 50-year-old women, their bodies, sex, and relationships.”\n\nSo what is in the air right now? And what’s behind these later-in-life sexual revelations? We talked to Silfcoff to find out exactly what’s going on here in this week’s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox’s weekly call-in show. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you’d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\n\nWhat prompted you to write about this in the first place?\n\nI split up from my ex in my late 40s, after a very long relationship of 21 years. When I came out of it, I just thought that what lay ahead of me would be a pretty spinster-ish existence. I was really, really sick for a long time in my adulthood, and my marriage was very long and there were two children. I just felt like, “Well, who is going to want this bag of problems? Now I’m 50.” Life is going to be orange pekoe tea, Masterpiece Theater, taking care of my kids, and hopefully remobilizing my writing, and that’s it. And then instead what happened was I had a lot of wonderful new relationships with a lot of wonderful men and the kind of sex that I don’t think I had even had in my 20s: a total new world of openness, exploration, interest, comfort in myself, self-knowledge and even, I daresay, wisdom. It felt revelatory.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

But then, as stuff started coming out of the culture, some of my other friends divorced and had similar situations to mine, I realized that what I had been doing or what I had experienced post-marriage was really part of a much larger cultural story that might ring true for many women in America and beyond today.\n\nWhat do you think the factors are in this mid-life sexual revitalization?\n\nThe women who are middle-aged now are — for the most part — Gen X. You’re starting to get some millennial middle-aged people as well. And Gen X women had a really interesting formative experience when it comes to sex in the ’90s. Divorce is also happening later than ever.\n\nDivorce and sexual exploration for women is a very old story: You get divorced and suddenly find a little piece of yourself sexually. I feel like that’s kind of a big part of the story as well. So women having a bit of this sexual rediscovery later and finding when they’re 47 or 55 that desire is still there, that sexual function is still there, that — thanks to the amazing strides that Gen Z and millennials have made opening up what’s acceptable sexually — acceptance is still there.\n\nRelated The online sex police are always watching and always so mad\n\nSo Gen X women are more comfortable in their bodies. They may be more into figuring out kinks and things like that. Why do you think this is happening with Gen X women in particular? Why is this generation so different from boomers?\n\nBoomers were constricted by a lot of societal norms that were, for lack of a better way of putting it, very mid-century. There was an open attitude toward sex, and free love was a boomer construct. But what happened with all of that stuff is that when all of those ideas really came to roost in the late ’80s and the early ’90s — when women were suddenly working but men were still the bosses — it created a tough situation for the people who inherited that very open sexual culture.\n\nI see Gen X as being a generation of women who really were plunked into an extremely sexualized landscape and were needing to fend for themselves. There wasn’t a lot of support for how to navigate bosses who were sexually predatory. There weren’t a lot of roadmaps for how to have sex or how to be a sexual person. That was both good and bad, because, for instance, many women didn’t experience orgasms because they just couldn’t figure out how and their male partners couldn’t figure out how so it just didn’t happen. I feel like that wouldn’t happen now. You’ve got things like OMG Yes, which is a website where you can find out how to have a female orgasm. It’s a much more open environment now in order to find out about sex. But at the same time among the younger generations, there is a bit of a cliff that’s happened with sexual frequency.\n\nI want to talk about that a little bit. There are so many conversations right now about how young people are having less and less sex. It seems like there’s a backlash to sex positivity. Do you think millennials and Gen Z women take these sexual freedoms for granted?\n\nYou do take it for granted, as you should. The parents create the situation, and the young people take it for granted.\n\nI think that the culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that you really see the sexual drop-off starting to happen in the same years that the iPhone was introduced. It’s in the same years that social media really got going.\n\n“The culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships.”\n\nPeople go out less, they hang out less. They do things together less in weird spaces where things can get weird. There was a lot more natural weirdness back in the day. And natural weirdness can lead to intimate moments, which can lead to sex. I just feel like there’s a certain cleanliness of experience in the culture right now where people are so afraid to intermingle in those old ways. It has had a big effect on people’s ability to hook up or have casual sex or go from one boyfriend to another to another until you find one that you like. In some ways, I think it’s wonderful for middle-aged people who already had that socialization.\n\nWhat do you hope for middle-aged women moving forward? Especially when it comes to sex, desire, and relationships?",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "All across the world, people are having fewer children. The birth rate is declining quickly in countries ranging from the United States to Finland to Mexico and Turkey.\n\nFertility data used to be a fairly esoteric concern. Not anymore. Vice President JD Vance talks about it regularly, Elon Musk calls it civilization’s greatest threat. There’s even a convention for “pronatalists,” Natalcon, taking place later this month in Texas. While worry about the falling birth rate has become a right-wing shibboleth, some Democrats are also leaning into “pro-family” rhetoric.\n\nWhy birth rates are declining is hotly debated. Some point to the increase in women’s education and income, others to the cost of childcare and housing. King’s College London social scientist Alice Evans has another theory.\n\n“What has happened everywhere, all at once, is that we see a rise of singles,” Evans told Today, Explained co-host Noel King, “and it precisely correlates with the decline in fertility.”\n\nKing talked to Evans for a recent episode of Today, Explained. Click the link below to hear the whole thing The following is a transcript edited for length and clarity.\n\nGive me your name. Tell me what you do and your area of expertise.\n\nMy name is Alice Evans and I’m a senior lecturer of international development at King’s College London, and my research focuses on gender…[and the birth rate]. My research has taken me from Mexican villages to the Atlas Mountains to Uzbek towns, through Korean universities. And by talking, learning from young men, older men, and women across the world, I’ve started to think: Why is fertility collapsing? What’s going on? And my interviews have really helped me understand this massive global problem.\n\nSo birth rates are going down all across the world. What are the leading theories as to why this is happening?\n\nThere’s the right-wing, the left-wing, and then there’s the Alice Evans take.\n\nOkay!\n\nI think the conservative right in the US will blame childless cat ladies, right? So they’ll say that, yes, women are overeducated, they’re living with their cats, and they’re very, very selfish.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut here’s the thing: That theory has two major omissions, because the collapse in fertility is happening at vastly different political economies. I mean, in Tunisia and Turkey, female labor force participation is very low, around 30 percent, and yet their fertility is only 1.5 (children per woman) — so even in places where women aren’t even getting jobs, they’re not having kids. India is an extremely patriarchal casteist society, but in Tamil Nadu, in the south, it’s got exactly the same fertility rate as England and Wales. That’s 1.4.\n\nSo it’s not just about these overeducated women pursuing their careers. Also, there’s also a class-based variation. The US right tends to blame these overeducated women — in Sweden and in Finland, the rate of childlessness is actually among the most disadvantaged people. They’re least likely to have children.\n\nI wonder if JD Vance knows any of this.\n\nHe should call me up!\n\nAlright, so that’s on the right, and then we heard earlier the theory on the left. There’s one theory that you often hear is that it’s just become too expensive. Women would like to have more children, but they can’t afford to. There’s not enough support. People aren’t making enough money, etc.\n\nAbsolutely. So many people across the world experience economic difficulties, and so these could be like very high house prices in New York, making it much more expensive to have an apartment with an extra room. Or the very expensive cost of child care. You know, when I was in San Francisco, people would say, [child care] might be $30,000! Super, super expensive, and that’s prohibitively difficult for many families.\n\nNow those difficulties are real, and governments should take those economic concerns seriously. And I’m all here supporting more affordable housing, greater access to safer, accessible child care. However, I don’t think that explanation is a full story, because it won’t explain why it’s happening everywhere, all at once, even at very, very different levels of income.\n\nSo that brings us to the Alice Evans theory.\n\nYes, exactly. So what has happened everywhere, all at once, is that we see a rise of singles. … Now, previously, from the 1960s onward, American couples had fewer children, but now what’s happening is they’re not even forming those couples. So in America, for example, over half of 18- to 34-year-olds are neither in a steady relationship nor living with a partner. Furthermore, most single Americans don’t feel much pressure to find a partner. Half say they’re not even looking.\n\nAre we sure that sexy singles are to blame? Because for many years, people have had kids without being married or without living with someone, without being in relationships.\n\nOh, that’s a great point, but that’s actually going down too now. In America, it’s always been the least educated who are less likely to marry and that’s where there’s been the steepest decline in fertility.\n\nI’m assuming you looked into why more people are staying single and also saying, “I want to be single.” What’s going on?\n\nSo here’s the thing, I think, historically, people would have married for one of three reasons. Very crudely: love, money, or respect.\n\nHmm.\n\nIn conservative societies where singledom is totally stigmatized, then you have to marry for respectability. In India where it’s so important, lots of aunties and uncles might be pestering people, you know, when are you getting married? When are you getting married? For my grandparents, it was just the done thing to get married.\n\nBut now, as society liberalizes, you know, Miley Cyrus championing flowers, “I can buy myself flowers,” there’s more permissibility. So that’s one thing.\n\nThere’s also economic convergence. As women earn their own incomes, they can increasingly be more independent. So compatibility increasingly depends on love, whether people really enjoy each other’s company. But of course, there are lots of frictions. People might be manipulative, deceitful, unfaithful, and if there are lots of frictions, they may call it quits. So that might be one aspect of it, economic convergence between men and women’s earnings, and cultural liberalization, making singledom more permissible.\n\nOn top of that, I think the big change that we see across the world, all at very different levels of income, is the massive improvement in hyper-engaging online entertainment: TikTok, video games, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Bridgerton, Netflix. You can browse Blackpink’s livestream, or go on PornHub — anything you like! All these technological advances enable instant access to the world’s most charismatic, charming content. Or maybe you prefer to do sports bets and gambling. And so why venture out when everything is at your fingertips, from Netflix to Zoom meetings? And so we see tracing the data over time that there is growing isolation, young people are spending much more time alone. In recent surveys, 65 percent of young American men say “no one knows me well.”\n\nAnd 28 percent of Gen Z didn’t socialize with anyone they didn’t live with in the past week. So we just see this global trend, and it is absolutely global. So for example, last year, I was in Mexico and lots of different Mexican little towns, and mothers would say the biggest problem here is that our teenage sons are spending all their time in their bedroom. And I’ll hear the same stories in little Indian villages, in Bangladeshi villages, all these people being hooked on hyper-engaging media.\n\nAre there any countries that buck the trend?\n\nWell, yes, actually. I was in Uzbekistan for a month last year, and there, there’s been an increase in fertility. When I’m in Uzbekistan, people will typically ask me four questions, and the answer should always be yes. Do you like Uzbekistan? Do you like Uzbek food? Are you married? Do you have children?\n\n\n\nAnd that tells you a lot about people’s priorities: a strong and a national pride, and also this strong onus that women should be married and have children. So that’s one option.\n\nYou [can also] just pump up the status of marriage and fertility. In Georgia, their Orthodox Patriarch similarly bumped up the status of children and fertility [by promising to personally baptize any baby born to parents who already have at least two children]. In Hungary, they tried to give people cheaper mortgages if they promised they’d be married and have children.\n\nBut what I’m saying about the Alice Evans theory of the collapsing fertility is that these pronatal incentives of saying $2,000, $5,000 to have an extra child, they’re simply too small if the prior constraint is that most people are increasingly single. Most governments are putting the cart before the horse, by focusing on couples, rather than realizing this prior constraint. If I’m right, that the problem is technology, this hyper-engaging media, distracting us, and driving this digital solitude, which ultimately prevents people from forming couples, then we need to think: Well, we have various options. Could we regulate technology in some way? Could we introduce further restrictions? Or what can we do in schools to ensure that we’re fostering social skills?\n\nRelated The movement desperately trying to get people to have more babies\n\nBecause just as we see declining maths and English reading skills across the OECD, simultaneously, my interviews suggest that if people aren’t spending time socializing, then they’re not necessarily developing the capacity to bond and charm and woo. You know, if you’re not mixing and mingling, then you get a little bit anxious if you go out into a crowd of unknown strangers.\n\nThis is such a good point. And so the question becomes: What do we do that doesn’t simultaneously make us feel like we are losing personal civil liberties? The government could take my phone and send me to speed dating, but that would feel like a real invasion. And, you know, personal freedoms, people feel pretty strongly about those, so in terms of how we should change the conversation around what went wrong here, what is going wrong here, and what we should do about it — what’s your best idea?\n\nSo my message for the world, based on my globally comparative research, is: Let’s focus on the core problem, and that’s the rise of singles. Now, how can we address that? First and foremost, we need to understand and tackle the problem. Let’s have a range of pilot initiatives to build community groups, to build local clubs and societies, to support communities so that people can mix and mingle and fall in love. I’m a great advocate for romantic love, for sharing our life stories, for empathizing and understanding with each other, that’s quintessentially what makes us human. So if we put that problem front and center and start working on that tricky conundrum, then maybe we can, you know, address loneliness and boost up fertility.",

He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nLast summer, I quit Spotify, and wrote about it with the rather unsubtle headline “Why I quit Spotify.” My reasons remain sound: The software had become clunky, the ads relentless, and the Sabrina Carpenter songs too inescapable. I wanted to find a better music streaming service. It gives me no pleasure to report that a few weeks ago, I rejoined.\n\nThe algorithm got me. I don’t just mean that it got me, the way the TikTok algorithm glues you to the screen. Spotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock or ongoing obsession with French touch music from the mid-Aughts. It took a few months of digging through the proverbial crates of Apple Music for me to realize that Spotify has something other streaming services could never get: 15 years of my music listening habits and artificially intelligent software to reinforce those habits.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nSpotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock.\n\nQuitting and unquitting Spotify made me realize something, though. As central as algorithmic feeds are to how you consume information, you have more control over how those algorithms shape your tastes and behavior than you might think.\n\nIf an algorithm works for you — as Spotify’s does for me — don’t feel bad about submitting to its effortless and convenient offerings.\n\nLean-forward listening\n\nMusic has always been important to me, and over the years, it started to feel like I had to gamify Spotify to find songs that I truly loved. When Spotify launched in 2011, it was basically a massive library of all the music, but over the years, it introduced more and more algorithmic recommendations and playlists that promised to match my taste. It still took work to find the good stuff.\n\nThis work is what has now made Spotify’s algorithms irreplaceable to me. It has a decade-and-a-half of my listening history, and over the years, I’ve learned its quirks and tinkered with it to meet my needs. I spent months trying to replicate this experience on Apple Music, but its algorithms struggled to surprise me.\n\nRelated Why I quit Spotify\n\nAll music streaming algorithms operate on two basic principles: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The content-based filtering tries to identify specific aspects of a song itself, including the artist, genre, mood, and so forth, to queue up the next song. Collaborative filtering refers to recommendations made based on other people who listen to a certain song and what else they listen to. If two people listen to the same five songs, there’s a good chance they’ll both like this sixth song. It’s all math, and sometimes there are anomalies that will delight you.\n\n“Some of the serendipity that you get is sort of error turned into virtue,” Glenn McDonald, a former data alchemist at Spotify and creator of Every Noise at Once, told me. “So you’re surprised, and sometimes those surprises are pleasant.”\n\nIt’s not just that Spotify’s recommendations tend to be pleasant because it has a lot of data about me. It’s that Spotify has the listening history of 675 million people, whose interests may overlap with mine in countless different ways. Over the years, I’ve developed a set of habits that help me hone those recommendations — things like making playlists, rejecting recommendations I don’t like, exploring artists’ catalogs, and maybe most importantly, digging through other people’s playlists.\n\nThis is what I call lean-forward listening. While it’s easy enough to click on Discover Weekly every Monday, lean back and listen to the whole thing like a radio show, and then move on to the next playlist, the more effort you put into curating your experience, the better the algorithms will work next time. At the very least, you’ll find your way onto a playlist that algorithms didn’t create.\n\nHow to resist algorithmic rule\n\nLike them or not, algorithmic recommendations aren’t going anywhere. Companies like Spotify like them because — when they work — algorithms keep people hooked on their products. Companies like Amazon like them because algorithmic recommendations enable them to steer people’s behavior. The right product recommendation could lead someone to buy something they didn’t otherwise plan on buying. (We’ve all done it.)\n\nYou can probably learn to live with it when you’re talking about music on Spotify or burrito restaurants on DoorDash. “The stakes are a little bit higher when it comes to recommending things like products on Amazon, and even higher when it comes to recommending things like content on Facebook,” said Meredith Broussard, a data journalism professor at New York University. “Because, as we all know, disinformation and misinformation are very, very popular, but not good.”\n\nThe role algorithms, which are designed to boost engagement, play in spreading misinformation is a book-length topic. For now, I’ll just reiterate that you don’t have to lean back and let Facebook, Google, or X flood you with algorithmically generated information. You can learn more about how these platforms use algorithms and steer them to your advantage.\n\nIf you’re sick of the algorithm on X feeding you right-wing propaganda, try Bluesky, which lets you pick different algorithms for your feed. And if Netflix or any other streaming service has gotten stale, try nuking your view history and starting over. Spotify offers a list of details about how it recommends content and how you can make tweaks. And Amazon has a tool that’s designed to improve your recommendations. (I have tried all of these things, including the Amazon tool, which is very tedious but still possibly helpful.)\n\nThings get a little tougher on big platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, whose algorithms tend toward the black box end of the spectrum. Still, knowing how algorithms work and playing an active role in making them work better for you can improve your experience on almost any platform. Algorithms are only in charge if you let them be.\n\nIn some cases, you might like it when the algorithm’s in charge. This is how I generally feel on Spotify, although I’m constantly correcting it and guiding it. This is also how I generally feel on Amazon, where I try to buy only the basics. I quit Instagram a while ago when I decided the algorithm was in charge a little too much. If I get bored one day, I might try it again.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nThe next phase of Elon Musk’s plan to entangle his companies with the workings of the federal government is well underway. That entails not only President Donald Trump’s photo op with a Tesla in front of the White House but also, surprisingly, the future of your internet connection.\n\nMore specifically, Musk is making moves that could change the way millions of Americans access the internet by boosting Starlink, the satellite-based internet company operated by his company, SpaceX, of which he is the founder, CEO, and major shareholder.\n\nStarlink and other space-based internet projects work by beaming internet service from satellites in orbit down to Earth’s surface, as opposed to wired broadband internet, which typically relies on fiber-optic cable. Satellite internet’s major advantage is that, with a few exceptions, it can work almost anywhere on the planet. Its drawbacks — including slow speeds, high latency, and spotty reliability — mean that fiber internet is better for the vast majority of people right now.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn the last week or so, the Commerce Department said it plans to rewrite the rules of a $42 billion high-speed internet initiative in a way that would benefit Starlink. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meanwhile granted Starlink a waiver that will make its new service, which lets phones connect to satellites, more powerful, as satellite competitors urged the agency to rein in Musk’s company, which they say is “anticompetitive.”\n\nMusk affiliates have also reportedly instructed government agencies to start using Starlink. The White House is now using Starlink “donated” by the company “to improve internet access on the campus,” according to the New York Times, and the General Services Administration has also been using the service, apparently without oversight. SpaceX confirmed that it’s leasing Starlink kits to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), amid reports that the agency might cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink instead. The company denied that it was trying to take over the contract.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake here, but this isn’t just about the money. (Musk doesn’t really need it.) Some people are worried that these developments represent the early steps of a power shift in the telecom industry, one that could result in the world’s richest man deciding how the nation’s communications network works.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation.”\n\nIn addition to hacking away at the federal government in his unelected position as the head of DOGE, Musk could also become the single individual who is “the dominant force in telecom policy,” according to Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and former chief of staff at the FCC. What’s more, the US telecommunications system is key to national security, and Musk’s business interests might not always line up with Washington’s.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation,” Levin said. “It’s very troubling.”\n\nSome of this must sound hyperbolic. It’s also hypothetical — for now. I’ve been writing about Starlink since before it launched its first batch of satellites in 2019, and from bringing remote parts of the world online to connecting Ukrainian soldiers at war, there’s no doubt that the technology is incredible.\n\nBut if recent events are any indication, the Trump administration plans to advantage Starlink in ways that benefit Musk more than the people who need better internet service. It also opens the door for Musk to become a much bigger power broker in the telecom world — and have more of a say in how you get online.\n\nElon’s space internet is not better than Earth internet yet\n\nIt’s tempting to think Starlink is the future of internet service. It’s very easy to set up, which is a huge deal to anyone who lacks broadband access — soldiers in Ukraine, for example, or farmers in rural America. But Starlink is not the same as the fiber-based broadband that’s become the gold standard for internet access.\n\nFor a number of reasons, space internet isn’t as fast, as reliable, or as cheap as terrestrial broadband. That’s why Congress prioritized companies that lay fiber-optic cable with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which provides federal funding to bring high-speed internet access to as many as 8 million Americans who have never had it, as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick now wants to make the program “technology neutral,” a change that would increase Starlink’s chances of getting grants. Whereas Musk’s company was on track to receive a little over $4 billion under the old rules, Starlink could now get between $10 billion and $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the Commerce Department goes through with the proposed changes to the BEAD program, its implementation would be delayed — more than one expert told me it would be by at least a year. Which is ironic given that Republicans made delays in BEAD’s rollout a talking point during the 2024 election. This process involves digging miles of trenches for tubes of cables that connect far-flung parts of the country. It takes time and costs money, but this infrastructure would last for decades.\n\n“It is truly a historic opportunity to get fiber to a lot of these places,” Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told me. “We’ll probably never have another opportunity like this.”\n\nStarlink dishes are easy to set up, but they don’t offer the same speed and reliability as fiber. Cate Dingley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome argue that Starlink and other satellite-based internet companies could get people online more quickly and without the expense of laying fiber. Starlink already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit and is trying to add more. But it’s unclear how quickly Starlink could actually add more users, since the company already has a waiting list for people to sign up because its network is at capacity.\n\nThat’s not to mention the fact that, for now, Starlink is neither faster nor cheaper than terrestrial broadband. Starlink delivers download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, while the FCC defines broadband as 100 Mbps. The average download speed in the US is about 275 Mbps. Starlink also currently charges customers $80 a month for its “Residential Lite” service, while the average US internet bill is $78 a month.\n\nThis is what makes the Trump administration’s apparent preferential treatment of Musk’s company so frustrating. It’s a poorer solution that takes longer and doesn’t result in savings for most Americans.\n\nMusk posts Starlink into the FAA\n\nWe don’t yet know how things will shake out with BEAD. The Commerce Department could change its mind, and the broadband infrastructure expansion could break ground in a few states this spring. However, the Trump administration is already starting to use Starlink in unusual ways.\n\nThe FAA, like many federal government agencies, is dealing with massive staff cuts at the behest of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Just days after 67 people died in a midair collision near Washington’s Reagan Airport, Musk’s staff urged FAA staffers to accept buyout offers, which more than 1,300 of them did, according to The Atlantic. DOGE also ended up firing about 400 FAA employees. When Musk’s team tried to lay off air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy finally intervened.\n\nRelated The year space internet takes off\n\nAt the same time — and operating on orders from Musk himself — a SpaceX engineer started to deploy Starlink technology on FAA systems. Musk posted on X that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly,” that “the situation is extremely dire,” and that he would send Starlink dishes to the rescue. The FAA has since confirmed that it’s reviewing the $2.4 billion Verizon contract and testing Starlink equipment at several locations, including in Alaska, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\nMusk’s posting-fueled intervention at the FAA is a scary one. Almost single-handedly, the billionaire threw cold water on a contract with Verizon, one that will affect the safety and security of Americans. Although it’s not clear if Starlink will indeed take over this particular contract, we have a glimpse at what it looks like for a singular bureaucrat — one that sells satellite dishes that don’t always work — to call the shots.\n\n“If you’re downloading stuff to your house in a rural area, and your speed drops because the system is oversubscribed, that’s annoying,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge. “If you’re the FAA, and your speed drops because the capacity is oversubscribed, that’s deadly.”\n\nProject 2025’s surprising role in all this\n\nElon Musk and DOGE, which is run by employees of Musk’s companies, certainly appear to be operating within the federal government to promote the best interests of those companies. The “why” of it all will take some time to figure out. Less than two months into Trump’s second presidency, we’re too busy keeping track of what’s even happening, especially where Musk is involved.\n\nAs for Starlink and Elon Musk’s apparent ambitions to dominate the US telecom industry, the FCC’s cooperation is essential. And Brendan Carr, the agency’s new chair, happens to be a big Elon Musk fan. Carr first made contact with Musk on X, where the two exchanged complaints about Democrats denying Starlink broadband subsidies and blamed Kamala Harris for rolling BEAD out too slowly. Carr was also the author of the chapter on the FCC for the big report published by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In it, he argues against terrestrial broadband expansion and in favor of accelerating the development of satellite technology, like Starlink.\n\nStarlink constellations look spectacular after they launch, but each satellite only lasts five years in orbit. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nOne of Project 2025’s main goals is to “dismantle the administrative state,” and in Musk, the right found a key ally. Musk has also found an opportunity: When the bureaucrats are all fired, someone still has to make decisions, and it’s easier to move quickly without any oversight.\n\nAcross the world, people are setting Tesla dealerships on fire to protest Musk’s gutting of the federal workforce and hoping to tank its stock. But what’s happening more quietly with Starlink, the Commerce Department, and the FCC shows that the multibillionaire isn’t just interested in making money. He’s consolidating power in Washington and helping determine what the future will look like.\n\nSelling cars is one thing, but taking control over America’s telecommunications network is another. Musk is not there yet, but we have already seen Musk use Starlink specifically to intervene in military operations abroad — he prevented Ukraine from launching a surprise attack against Russia in 2022. That sets a scary precedent for what the future holds.\n\n“Elon Musk has been pretty cavalier about his ability to turn on or turn off Starlink to influence policy decisions,” Garner, from the Benton Institute, told me, referring to a series of recent posts on X from Musk about cutting off Starlink access in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s not just scary that Musk is becoming more powerful in the telecom industry. It is uniquely terrifying that he alone could decide to bring networks down. And that might be an even more important development to keep our eyes on than the Tesla ad he produced in front of the White House.\n\nUpdate, March 18, 9:45 am ET: This story was originally published March 12 and has been updated to include news of the White House’s use of Starlink.",

        "content": "is a policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nAmerica’s fragile child care system relies heavily on immigrant workers. Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown could cripple it.\n\nSince 2011, federal guidance has advised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents against conducting enforcement in “sensitive locations” like hospitals, churches, schools and day care centers. On his first day back in office, Trump removed these longstanding protections, marking a major change from his first term as president. Now — with ICE officials charged with increasing their daily arrests from a few hundred people to upward of 1,500, and top immigration agents demoted for not deporting people fast enough — day care centers stand as direct targets.\n\nThe crackdown on immigrants threatens to upend an industry where foreign-born staff make up one-fifth of the workforce nationally — and nearly half in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Jose, California. Research led by the New American Economy think tank estimated that over 200,000 undocumented immigrants work in child care and day care services. The new, harsher enforcement comes at a particularly precarious time, as major employers phase out remote work policies, leaving parents with an intensifying scramble for child care.\n\nChild care programs already have an employee turnover rate 65 percent higher than average. The pay helps explain why: As of 2023, the median hourly wage for full-time, year-round child care workers was just $14.60, and the field ranked as the 10th lowest-paid occupation out of nearly 750 jobs across the economy, according to one analysis. The Trump crackdown could make everything even worse.\n\nJessica Brown, an economist at the University of South Carolina, has studied how earlier bouts of immigration enforcement affected child care markets. Her analysis of the Secure Communities program, which operated nationwide from 2008 to 2014, found that even when immigration enforcement primarily targeted men, it still disrupted female-dominated child care. The program decreased the overall supply of child care workers and centers and reduced enrollment overall.\n\nDespite claims that immigrants are taking jobs from native-born Americans, when immigrant workers left the child care industry, native-born workers didn’t fill the gap. Instead, the number of native-born child care workers also decreased — as costs went up and centers closed.\n\nToday’s situation could prove even more disruptive.\n\n“The current raids represent a much more salient threat of deportation for women,” said Brown, who anticipates a larger impact on child care markets compared to Secure Communities, at least in the short-term. “The long-term effect depends on whether this becomes the new normal. More importantly, it’s about perception — even if the raids decrease, once fear takes hold in immigrant communities, the chilling effects could linger.” Among those most vulnerable to such fear are the children themselves.\n\nThe cascading effects of immigration enforcement\n\nThese chilling effects aren’t theoretical. The first Trump term provides insight into the impacts these raids could have on both kids and child care providers. Back in 2017, the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), a national anti-poverty organization, launched a multistate study on how Trump’s immigration policies were affecting children under age 8. In interviews with staff and families across six states, researchers found that children as young as three were showing signs of trauma from fears about enforcement.\n\nEarly childhood educators reported disturbing new behaviors — increased aggression, separation anxiety, and withdrawal — that they described as distinct from children’s behaviors in past years. One preschool director in Georgia described a 5-year-old child whose anxiety was so severe that he was biting his fingertips until they bled.\n\nThe study found widespread drops in day care attendance and enrollment as families isolated themselves. Programs reported parents leaving young children with older siblings or grandparents instead of in formal care, minimizing time outside the home to avoid law enforcement encounters. With enrollment declines cutting into already-thin margins and state subsidies often tied to attendance, these shifts threatened the financial viability of centers that entire neighborhoods depend on.\n\nThe crisis extended beyond the direct provision of child care. Providers and parents reported increased reluctance to access public benefits like health insurance and nutrition assistance due to worries that Medicaid or SNAP information could be shared with immigration officials.\n\nRelated Fixing the child care crisis starts with understanding it\n\nEarly childhood staff themselves reported intense anxiety about increased incidents of racism and xenophobia affecting the families they serve and, in some cases, themselves personally. Many providers described the emotional burden of being asked by parents to become emergency guardians for their children in case they were deported.\n\nWendy Cervantes, the director of Immigration and Immigrant Families at CLASP who co-led the research, told Vox that the difficulty of finding child care providers who have the right skills to educate dual-language children is often overlooked. “There are not a lot of people who have the training and are also bilingual who are competent,” she said.\n\nHow policymakers, advocates, and child care directors are trying to protect families and staff\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, many child care providers didn’t even know their centers were protected under the “sensitive locations” federal guidance, leading advocates to launch national campaigns to raise awareness about these safeguards. Now, however, those same advocates are working to help providers understand that guidance is no longer in effect, but that they still have constitutional rights.\n\n“They still have rights under the Fourth Amendment to restrict the extent to which ICE can enter,” Cervantes said. Immigration agents still need signed judicial warrants with a specific person’s name and address to raid a private space. To help providers navigate these changes, CLASP is coordinating resources and planned a national webinar at the end of February for child care programs specifically.\n\nThe political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it’s setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy.\n\nMany child care centers are also developing new protocols to operate in this environment. Some are removing outdoor signage to avoid ICE attention and developing new systems to communicate warnings to parents. Others are rethinking their data collection policies, to limit questions that ask about families’ immigration status.\n\n“There’s a difference between finding out something and documenting,” said Atenas Burrola Estrada, an attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. She emphasized the importance of child care centers making plans ahead of time so that staff know what they need to do if ICE enforcement comes.\n\n“What can be different about child care is the fear-factor, and it can be much more traumatizing for a small child,” she said. “Providers also need to know who to call if mom and dad don’t come home, so they can avoid children ending up in state custody.”\n\nSome states are hoping to create new protections through legislation. In California, a bill would make it harder for ICE agents to enter schools or child care centers. And even if agents met the requirements for entry, they’d still only be able to enter areas where children aren’t present.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Sen. Richard Blumenthal recently reintroduced a bill to codify the “sensitive locations” federal guidance. But the legislation is a long shot: It failed to pass in 2017, and today’s political landscape has shifted so that even many Democrats now support tougher immigration enforcement amid growing concern about border security. Earlier this year, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, requiring mandatory detention for immigrants accused of theft and related crimes – exactly the type of broad enforcement that advocates fear could sweep up child care workers.\n\nAs politicians wage war on immigration in the name of protecting American jobs, their policies threaten to unravel the very system that keeps millions of Americans — especially mothers — in the workforce. In classrooms across the country, children form bonds with care workers who help shape their earliest years, and immigrant teachers create the bilingual, multicultural spaces that define modern American childhood. The political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it’s setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy — from parents forced to cut back work hours to businesses losing productive employees to a generation of children without supportive care at their most formative age.\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Bainum Family Foundation.

She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nA commuter wearing a protective mask enters a subway station in the Herald Square area of New York on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the media did not exactly cover itself in glory. To quote myself from an early February 2020 piece, when the virus had already been spreading for more than a month in China and the US already had confirmed cases:\n\nIn the last week or so, new cases of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus have soared … so have news articles scolding us for worrying about it. “Don’t worry about the coronavirus. Worry about the flu,” BuzzFeed argued. The flu “poses the bigger and more pressing peril,” the Washington Post said. “Why should we be afraid of something that has not killed people here in this country?” an epidemiologist argued in the LA Times. Other outlets have agreed. An ex-White House health adviser has told Americans to “stop panicking and being hysterical.”\n\nMy article made the case that maybe it was slightly reasonable to worry about the coronavirus. But of course, I got some crucial stuff wrong, too. I wrote:\n\nSimilarly, there’s a conspiracy theory circulating that the virus escaped from a Wuhan research lab. (Not true.) And there’s a different conspiracy theory that it was engineered by Bill Gates (who funds a research group that has done pandemic-control exercises about a hypothetical deadly coronavirus). (Also not true.) Internet trolls have spread false claims that drinking bleach protects against coronavirus. (Please don’t do this.)\n\nTwo of those conspiracy theories were in fact absurd, but one was correct: the virus absolutely may have escaped from a Wuhan research lab. We’ll probably never know, but we know for sure that many of the scientists publicly asserting that this was a wild conspiracy theory privately worried that it was true.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut my article isn’t the main thing that people think of when I ask them how they feel Vox handled the early coronavirus crisis. Instead, almost everyone I talk to remembers another article that Recode (at that time a vertical of Vox) ran a week later.\n\nThe piece was headlined “‘No handshakes, please’: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus,” and while it doesn’t actually contain any blatant factual inaccuracies, the tone is very clear: Only a paranoid tech bro would be worrying about the coronavirus.\n\n“Data from the CDC suggests that the flu is a greater threat to Americans than the coronavirus. Yet unlike the flu, the coronavirus is new and not well understood, which makes it especially scary to the public, including Silicon Valley’s elite,” the article argues. But of course, even at that early moment in the pandemic, it was entirely correct to be more nervous about the novel coronavirus — which had a much wider range of possible outcomes — than a known health threat like the flu.\n\nAlmost no one I talk to here in the Bay Area about Vox’s performance on Covid-19 remembers my article pushing back on dismissiveness and warning people should take Covid more seriously. Almost all of them remember the contempt they felt that the Recode article was encouraging toward them.\n\nRelated What the media needs to get right in the next pandemic\n\nThe lesson here — for the media and for anyone who works in public communication — is that it’s much easier to lose trust than to gain it.\n\nMoving forward without ever looking back\n\nA few weeks later, Europe was hit hard with the first catastrophic Covid surges — hospitals overwhelmed, bodies piling up, patients struggling to breathe in hallways — and the media started taking Covid seriously.\n\nIn a sense, this is exactly what is supposed to happen — people saw new information and changed their minds. But the fact that there was an abrupt swerve was rarely acknowledged.\n\nWhen a journalist writes a piece that contains a clear factual inaccuracy requiring a correction, it’s a pretty big deal. I’ve had to issue corrections, and quite a few people are involved: my boss has to spend a fair bit of time working with me on the wording, and their boss has to sign off.\n\nCorrections are a high priority in the media — people will drop lots of other work to get a correction to a piece up. Journalists feel real pressure not to get things factually wrong, and to fix them when they do. A reporter having written several pieces that needed serious corrections is the kind of thing that will absolutely show up negatively on a performance review.\n\nBut there’s no clear mechanism for similar reflection when a piece doesn’t necessarily get the facts wrong, but just frames them wrongly. That’s a problem, because framing can do just as much to misinform readers as facts.\n\nThe price of ignoring getting it wrong\n\nIn the case of the Covid pandemic, early coverage that dismissed peoples’ fears and suggested they were irrational probably delayed our collective response — and lastingly decreased the credibility of the media and public health communicators when they later needed to muster a serious response.\n\nA lot of the fault here lies with public health officials, many of whom initially downplayed the threat and called the lab origin theory a conspiracy. But too often the media tended to treat these proclamations without the skeptical questioning that was warranted, especially given the uncertainty. And while I’ve chosen to highlight the early February spats over whether Covid was less concerning than the flu, this pattern repeated itself over and over again.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThe initial justification for lockdowns was that we just needed a few weeks to slow the spread so our first responders weren’t overwhelmed; but then those lockdowns persisted, without clear acknowledgment that the plan had changed. On masks, the line went from “masks don’t help much and should be reserved for first responders and doctors” (the contradiction here rarely acknowledged) to “masks are crucial.”\n\nOutdoor gatherings were always much safer than indoor ones (and I said so here in Vox from early on), but a lot of public health officials criticized outdoor gatherings — up until the Black Lives Matter protests, at which point they largely said such events were fine.\n\nEvery one of these changes happened without much reflection on why we had previously got it wrong. Every one of them spent credibility that was desperately needed with the American people. Every one meant treating people, frankly, like they weren’t very smart, and in the long run did incalculable damage to public trust.\n\nSo why hasn’t there been more of a reckoning? The primary reason is that there are incredibly powerful incentives for everyone involved not to participate in one.\n\nWith something as new and as fast moving as Covid, it was almost inevitable that everybody would get something radically wrong. When we open up the Pandora’s box of recriminations and accountability, our mistakes loom much larger than our correct calls.\n\nThe sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, one of the better pandemic commentators, wrote earlier this week about how we were lied to about the possibility of a Covid lab leak. She was met by near universal, seething hostility from Twitter, which blamed her for all of the New York Times’s bad coverage of everything related to the whole pandemic.\n\nA better way to cover uncertainty\n\nI’m expecting a similar overwhelmingly negative response to this piece, in which I admit a mistake — initially dismissing the lab leak theory — that everyone had probably forgotten about. Ours is a media environment that doesn’t encourage acknowledging your errors; it’s much safer to memory hole them.\n\nWith Covid, this has been made worse by the fact that there are still major disagreements over key questions about our response. I think that masks work to prevent the spread of disease, though I also think we made the wrong tradeoff in requiring kids to wear masks and generally refused to acknowledge what a major sacrifice they were for many people who just hated the feeling on their faces.\n\nBut that’s not satisfying to someone who thinks that all masking policy was a mistake and that a true Covid admission of errors would mean admitting that masks didn’t work, period. I think the vaccines were great, so my takeaways on the lessons from Covid won’t be convincing to the half of the country that thinks the vaccines were terrible.\n\nGiven all that, it’s not shocking that there hasn’t been a real Covid reckoning. But I think that has been very, very damaging.\n\nEvery single one of us lived through a devastating period during the pandemic. Many of us buried loved ones. Many worked to exhaustion in overcrowded hospitals. Many were asked to make sacrifices that they feel were later treated with contempt and indifference.\n\nIt was a massive, collective world-altering event — and now that it’s over we barely talk about it, because talking about it would mean reckoning with it and no one in power wants to reckon with it.\n\nSo Covid’s long-term effects will reverberate through the country: lower trust in institutions, an absolute unwillingness to think seriously about preventing the next pandemic, failing schools, and rising isolation. And all that will unfold without any real clarity on how we got here and how we can make sure it never happens again.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "title": "The invisible homeless crisis that official statistics miss",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n\n“The only thing worse than being homeless in America is not being considered homeless in America,” says Brian Goldstone, a journalist and ethnographer. America’s homelessness crisis extends far beyond what we see on the streets, and Goldstone wants us to pay attention to those who are hidden from public view.\n\nIn his new book, There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America, Goldstone examines the lives of families caught in extended-stay motels, sleeping in cars, or shuffling between precarious arrangements — situations that often leave them uncounted in official homeless statistics despite housing instability. His reporting challenges the longstanding American narrative connecting homelessness with unemployment or an unwillingness to work.\n\nI spoke with Goldstone about the distinction between “falling” and “being pushed” into homelessness, the stigma attached to the homeless label, and his perspective on what meaningful solutions might require. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou note that many people with unstable housing situations resist identifying as “homeless.” How does this reluctance to adopt the label affect both individuals’ experiences and our collective understanding of the housing crisis?\n\nThere is absolutely a stigma attached to the term “homeless” and there’s also a way in which HUD’s prevailing definition of homelessness — where only those who are sleeping on the streets or in homeless shelters count — has filtered into the public narrative and the public imagination. The people I’m writing about in my book belong to that public — they themselves often don’t recognize themselves as homeless when they’re doubling up with friends or sleeping in motels. They’re often surprised to learn, for example, that their kids’ schools, and the Department of Education, do consider them homeless if they’re in those situations. These official metrics and official ways of conceptualizing the problem absolutely impact the people experiencing it on a psychological level.\n\nOne person in my book, Celeste, her house burns down and when she finds she can basically secure no other apartment because an eviction has been filed against her, she and her son wind up at this extended stay hotel. At some point a social worker at her son’s elementary school gave her this homeless resource list. But Celeste was like, “I’m not putting that homeless label on me and my kids.” Part of it was this idea that she didn’t want to speak something into existence, she didn’t want to make this homeless category her identity. But in practical terms, she also ignored those resources until she was later diagnosed with cancer and she realizes that she’s in this hotel trap that’s virtually impossible to get out of.\n\nSo there was that tension of refusing the [homeless] category, but then realizing she needs the category. We have a measure of poverty in America and a lot of people who fall under the poverty threshold don’t want to necessarily think of themselves as impoverished, but that that definition and threshold is absolutely essential for determining and parceling out resources.\n\nMost of the reporting for your book was done before homelessness really blew up post-pandemic as a political issue in the US, with encampments and then the Grants Pass v. Johnson Supreme Court case. Tell me about your decision to not bring that more recent history into the book.\n\nI didn’t know a pandemic was coming, but in retrospect, I think it’s really important to show that the emergency that we became more aware of during the pandemic — when we saw how absolutely threadbare the social safety net was — was already well on its way. The pandemic intensified rather than produced this housing catastrophe.\n\nAs far as how all this relates to the encampment sweeps, the criminalization of homelessness, the war on unhoused people that has been unleashed and given the green light by the Grants Pass decision, I tried to not draw a clear line of demarcation between the kind of homelessness that has become the object of those sorts of crackdowns, and the more invisible or hidden population that I’m writing about, which are largely working families.\n\nBy and large these tents on the street are like the tip of the iceberg, and that’s the most extreme edge of homelessness in America. A lot of the people I’m writing about in the book are like what’s under the water surface. But it’s important to say that this is all one giant iceberg. The more extreme and acute this emergency gets, the more visible it becomes, because it simply pushes up to the surface. But until we address what’s under that surface or or out of view, that visibility will continue. There just won’t be enough places for it to hide, so to speak.\n\nOther countries have for-profit housing systems but don’t experience our level of homelessness. Based on your reporting, do you see a way forward that could maintain aspects of our current system while meaningfully addressing homelessness, or does the solution require more fundamental change?\n\nI hesitate to enter directly into debates over market-rate housing and zoning reform and tenant rights and rent control. My own view is that we need everything like that, and nothing on its own is going to be sufficient. The only thing that might truly be sufficient is a massive investment at every level of government in social housing.\n\nI think that we can only convince ourselves that these kinds of half measures are adequate when we have narrowed the scope, magnitude and nature of the crisis. I don’t think that a few tiny homes here or a couple of permanent supportive housing units over there are anywhere close to what we need to truly address the magnitude and severity of this problem. But it doesn’t mean that we don’t also need those things. So yes, something fundamental has to change in how we approach housing in America.\n\nSome of your characters developed a fairly cynical view of the homeless services industry, and we have a new Republican administration casting doubt on the idea of more subsidies to help. Certainly reading your book one could see a little bit how that might be true. What is your own view now?\n\nI think the current system is very much working within the constraints that have been imposed on this world of homeless services, and in many cases they’re doing the best they can with what they have. Homeless service providers have been told to prioritize those who — according to certain scholars and experts on this issue — are most at immediate risk of dying on the street and so they’re trying to ration out scarce resources. I think the problem is not the system itself. It’s what has shaped that system.\n\nYou focused a lot in your book on extended stay hotels and motels — which are these last-resort options where people pay a lot of money for pretty poor quality conditions, receive none of the traditional tenant protections, and are often not counted as officially homeless when staying there, even as they can’t afford to go anywhere else. They exist in such a gray area of our housing conversation. How are you thinking about these places today?\n\nFor the thousands and thousands of families and individuals living at these extended stay hotels, which are effectively for-profit homeless shelters, they’re places where the casualties of America’s housing crisis have been consigned and then people find it almost impossible to leave. The way I think about them often is like — the only thing worse than being homeless in America is not being considered homeless in America. The only thing worse than being a low-income tenant in America is not even having the “privilege” of being considered a tenant.\n\nI think the people living in these hotels are at once the most vulnerable renters in America and the most vulnerable homeless people in America. And I know it sounds paradoxical that those two things can coexist, but I think that’s what makes these places so important for us to reckon with.\n\nYou write that families aren’t falling into homelessness, they’re being pushed. Who or what is doing this pushing, and how does that change how we think about addressing the problem?\n\nThere’s this language of “falling into homelessness,” which almost makes it seem like someone tripped, or like they’ve been struck by a natural disaster. That there’s something, unavoidable, beyond their control, beyond anyone’s control, and it just kind of happened to them. I argue in my book that the immense wealth accumulating in cities across America, and the revitalization of urban space, isn’t just sort of existing alongside this deprivation and precarity, but that it’s actively producing it. And so when I talk about people being pushed into homelessness and this kind of insecurity, I’m really trying to insist on that causal relationship.\n\nYou highlight the “working homeless” throughout your book — people who have jobs yet still lack stable housing. How does this reality challenge the longstanding American narrative that connects homelessness with unemployment or unwillingness to work?\n\nMany people in this country, especially those who are not experiencing this precarity themselves, have needed to believe a story about poverty and homelessness that says if people just work harder, if they just get a job, they will be okay. Yet in some cases, certain jobs can actually make it even more likely that homelessness will be waiting for you and I think that’s really, really hard for us to come to terms with. What was so shocking to me is just seeing people work and work and work and work some more and work some more after that and it’s never enough. It’s never enough to secure their most basic material needs, housing being the most essential, arguably, among them. That reality is not new, that didn’t just happen in the last few years, but the scale is new.\n\nPeople across the political spectrum almost need to believe certain things about homelessness because acknowledging the reality calls into question too many of the fundamental assumptions that we in the United States hold dear, like the necessity for hard work. And I’m saying that hard work is not enough in this country.",

He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nThere’s a thought experiment that has taken on almost mythic status among a certain group of technologists: If you build an artificial intelligence and give it a seemingly innocuous goal, like making as many paper clips as possible, it might eventually turn everything — including humanity — into raw material for more paper clips.\n\nAbsurd parables like this one have been taken seriously by some of the loudest voices in Silicon Valley, many of whom are now warning that AI is an existential risk, more dangerous than nuclear weapons. These stories have shaped how billionaires including Elon Musk think about AI and fueled a growing movement of people who believe it could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to humanity.\n\nSo what exactly should we actually be worried about when it comes to AI?\n\nIn Good Robot, a special four-part podcast series launching March 12 from Unexplainable and Future Perfect, host Julia Longoria goes deep into the strange, high-stakes world of AI to answer that question. But this isn’t just a story about technology — it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).\n\nFor a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case.

Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), while OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has talked of creating a “magic intelligence in the sky” — something like a god.\n\nBut whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

Catholic Charities seeks an exemption from Wisconsin’s law requiring nearly all employers to pay taxes that fund unemployment benefits. If the Court grants this exemption, the justices could give many employers a broad new power to evade laws governing the workplace.\n\nLike every state, Wisconsin taxes employers to fund benefits for workers who lose their jobs. Like most states, Wisconsin’s unemployment benefits law also contains an exemption for church-run nonprofits that are “operated primarily for religious purposes.”\n\nThe state’s supreme court recently clarified that this exemption only applies to nonprofit employers that primarily engage in religious activities such as holding worship services or providing religious education. It does not apply to employers like Catholic Charities, which provide secular services like feeding the poor or helping disabled people find jobs — even if the employer is motivated by religious faith to provide these secular services.\n\nCatholic Charities, however, claims that it has a First Amendment right to an exemption, arguing, among other things, that Wisconsin’s limited exemption for some religious nonprofits and not others discriminates against Catholics.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nNone of its arguments are persuasive, at least under the Supreme Court’s existing decisions. But precedent plays hardly any role in how this Court decides religion cases. The Republican justices routinely vote to overrule, or simply to ignore, religion cases that they disagree with. The Court’s very first major decision after Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s appointment gave Republicans a supermajority on the Court effectively overruled a decision governing worship services during the Covid-19 pandemic that was only a few months old.\n\nRealistically, in other words, the Court will likely decide Catholic Charities based on the justices’ personal preferences, rather than by following the doctrine of stare decisis, which says that courts should typically follow their own precedents.\n\nThat said, it remains to be seen how far this Court might go in its ruling. It could choose to distinguish Catholic Charities — which is a legitimate charity that does genuinely admirable work — from employers who claim religious exemptions only to hurt their own employees. But if it chooses to be expansive, it could overrule a line of precedents that protect workers from exploitative employers who claim a religious justification for that exploitation.\n\n“Religious liberty” doesn’t mean religious organizations get civil society’s benefits and none of its costs\n\nIn order to understand the Catholic Charities case, it’s helpful to first understand the legal concept of a “corporation.” Corporations are entities that are typically easy to form under any state’s law, and which are considered to be entirely separate from their owners or creators. Forming a corporation brings several benefits, but the most important is limited liability. If a corporation is sued, it can potentially be liable for all of its assets, but the owners or controllers of that corporation are not on the hook for anything else.\n\nCorporations can also create their own corporations, thus protecting some of their assets from lawsuits.\n\nThink of it this way: Imagine that José owns two businesses, one of which sells auto parts, and another that fixes cars. If these businesses are incorporated, that means that José’s personal assets (such as his house) are protected if one of his businesses are sued. Moreover, if both businesses are incorporated as two separate entities, a lawsuit against one business cannot touch the other one. So if, say, the auto parts company sells a defective part, that company could potentially be put out of business by a lawsuit. But the car repair company will remain untouched.\n\nCatholic Charities is a corporation that is controlled by the Roman Catholic Church. According to its lawyers, the president of Catholic Charities in Superior, Wisconsin, is a Catholic bishop, who also appoints its board of directors. The Catholic Church gains significant benefits from this arrangement, because it means that a lawsuit against Catholic Charities cannot touch the church’s broader assets.\n\nUnder Wisconsin law, however, the church’s decision to separately incorporate Catholic Charities also has a cost. Wisconsin exempts employers that engage in religious activity such as worship services from its unemployment regime, but it does not give this exemption to charitable corporations that only engage in secular activity. Because Catholic Charities is a separate legal entity from the church itself, and because it does not engage in any of the religious activity that would exempt it from paying unemployment taxes, it does not get an exemption.\n\nPresumably, the church was aware of all of these consequences when it chose to separately incorporate Catholic Charities. The Catholic Church has very good legal counsel, and its lawyers would have advised it of both the benefits of separate incorporation (limited liability) and the price of that benefit (no unemployment exemption). Notably, Catholic Charities has paid unemployment taxes since 1972.\n\nBut Catholic Charities now claims that this decades-old arrangement is unfair and unconstitutional. According to its brief, “the Diocese of Superior operates Petitioners as separately incorporated ministries that carry out Christ’s command to help the needy,” but “if Catholic Charities were not separately incorporated, it would be exempt.” That very well may be true, but if Catholic Charities were not separately incorporated, it also would not benefit from limited liability.\n\nThat brief alleges three separate constitutional violations — it claims that Wisconsin discriminates “against religious groups with more complex polities” (that is, with more complex corporate structures), and it also raises two claims that both boil down to an allegation that Wisconsin is too involved with the church’s internal affairs because its law treats Catholic Charities differently if that entity were not separately incorporated.\n\nThe discrimination claim is weak, because the Constitution does not prohibit discrimination against entities with complex corporate structures, it prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion. Wisconsin law treats Catholics no differently than anyone else. If a Muslim, Hindu, Protestant, Jewish, or nonreligious charity also provides exclusively secular services, it also does not receive an exemption from the state’s unemployment law.\n\nSimilarly, Wisconsin law does not entangle the state in the church’s internal affairs, or otherwise dictate how the church must structure itself and its subordinate entities. It merely offers the church a bargain that it is free to turn down — the church may have limited liability, but only if it accepts the consequences of separate incorporation.\n\nA decision for Catholic Charities could have disastrous consequences for workers\n\nRealistically, the immediate consequences of a decision for Catholic Charities would be virtually nonexistent. The church maintains its own internal program that pays unemployment benefits to laid off workers, and it claims that this benefit program “provides the same maximum weekly benefit rate as the State’s system.” So it appears that, no matter who prevails before the Supreme Court, unemployed former employees of Catholic Charities will still receive similar benefits.\n\nRelated Religious conservatives have won a revolutionary victory in the Supreme Court\n\nBut other religious employers may not offer benefits to their unemployed workers. If Catholic Charities prevail in this case, that victory would likely extend to all organizations which, like Catholic Charities, engage in secular charitable work motivated by religious belief. So workers in other organizations could be left with nothing.\n\nHistorically, the Supreme Court was reluctant to allow religious employers to seek exemptions from laws that protect their workers, and for a very good reason — abandoning this reluctance risks creating the situation the Court tried to ward off in Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor (1985).\n\nTony Alamo was often described in news reports as a cult leader. He was convicted of sexual abuse against girls he considered to be his wives. One of his victims may have been as young as nine. Witnesses at his trial, according to the New York Times, testified that “Alamo had made all decisions for his followers: who got married; what children were taught in school; who got clothes; and who was allowed to eat.”\n\nThe Alamo Foundation case involved an organization which was nominally a religious nonprofit. But, as the Supreme Court explained, it operated “a number of commercial businesses, which include service stations, retail clothing and grocery outlets, hog farms, roofing and electrical construction companies, a recordkeeping company, a motel, and companies engaged in the production and distribution of candy.” Tony was the president of this foundation, and its workers received no cash salaries or wages — although they were given food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nThe federal government sued the foundation, alleging violations of federal minimum wage, overtime, and record keeping laws. And the Supreme Court rejected the foundation’s claim that it was entitled to a religious exemption from these laws. Had the Court ruled otherwise, it could have allowed people like Tony Alamo to exploit their workers with little recourse to federal or state law.\n\nThe Alamo Foundation opinion warned, moreover, that permitting the foundation to pay “substandard wages would undoubtedly give [it] and similar organizations an advantage over their competitors.” Cult leaders with vulnerable followers would potentially push responsible employers out of the market, because employers who remained bound by law would no longer be able to compete.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court used to be so concerned about religious companies gaining an unfair competitive advantage that, in United States v. Lee (1982), it announced a blanket rule that “when followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.” Religious entities were sometimes entitled to legal exemptions under Lee, but they had to follow the same workplace and business regulations as anyone else.\n\nIt’s important to be clear that the Catholic Church bears little resemblance to the Alamo cult, and Catholic Charities certainly does not exploit its workers in the same way that the Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation was accused of doing.",

So this group of Black voters went to court challenging that, saying it was a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote based on race.\n\nAnd so this federal district court threw out the map, agreeing with the Black voters. The conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld that ruling and said, you need to draw a new map, state, or this federal court will do it for you.\n\nAnd so the Louisiana legislature went back to the drawing board, drew a second map with two majority-Black districts, and then this group of non-African American voters came to court saying that this violated the Constitution because it was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. It relied too heavily on race.\n\nSo the state and then the Black voters that had challenged the first map both came to the Supreme Court to appeal, and the state says, look, we're between a rock and a hard place here. We wanted to address this violation of the Voting Rights Act, but we also — once we decided to do that, it was about politics.\n\nWe wanted to protect two powerful Republican incumbents in Congress, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and then Julia Letlow, who's on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law — a case that has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension with the federal courts.\n\nThe declaration comes as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg weighs whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process.\n\nWATCH: White House ignores court and invokes Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelans\n\nBoasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”\n\nGovernment attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg’s order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.\n\nCircuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis detained in the U.S. during World World II received better legal treatment than Venezuelan immigrants who were were deported to El Salvador this month under the same statute.\n\n“We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,” Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMillett is one of three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn’t rule from the bench Monday.\n\nA second judge appeared open to the administration’s argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation’s capital. The third judge on the panel didn’t ask any questions.\n\nThe administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.\n\nAlso on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.\n\nEnsign argued that Boasberg’s ruling was an “unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.”\n\n“The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,” said MiIlett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.\n\nJudge Justin Walker, whom Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration’s arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government’s arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.\n\n“You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,” Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\n“We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,” Gelernt said.\n\nWATCH: Federal judge questions Trump’s authority to deport migrants without due process\n\nWalker also pressed the plaintiffs’ lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking “a national security operation with foreign implications” survived appellate review.\n\nGelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to “short circuit” immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs’ attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.\n\n“This has all been done in secret,” Gelernt said.\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn’t ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.\n\nBoasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is “a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.”\n\n“The public also has a significant stake in the Government’s compliance with the law,” the judge wrote.\n\nTrump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nJust after midnight Monday, Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg’s impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.\n\nDuring a hearing Friday, Boasberg vowed to determine whether the government defied his oral order from the bench to turn planes around. The Justice Department has said that the judge’s oral directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn’t apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",

Watch in the player above.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nWATCH: Top Trump officials accidentally included reporter in Yemen strike chat on commercial app\n\nTuesday’s hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.\n\nThe annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration’s reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.\n\nFormer FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.\n\n“We have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,” Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from “narco-traffickers.” But, he added, “we’re not going to forget or ignore national security — never.”\n\nThe hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine.\n\nLast week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”",

So they both said they believe that the judiciary can review this.\n\nNow, Judge Justin Walker focused his questions on whether or not D.C. was the right venue, saying maybe this lawsuit should be brought somewhere else. Now, Judge Patricia Millett focused her questioning on due process. And she basically said that there was no record that the people that were deported under the Alien Enemies were necessarily Tren de Aragua, or if they were maybe victims of Tren de Aragua.\n\nAnd, specifically, Judge Millett said that there were planeloads of people. There were no procedures in place to notify these people who were deported, that Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here, referring to due process and hearing boards that were held the last time the Alien Enemies Act was invoked during World War II.\n\nThe final big moment during the hearing, Amna, was that the Justice Department lawyer said that, if the appeals court ruled in their favor, the government would immediately resume mass deportations under Alien Enemies without giving notice or without due process.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday the claim that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative.” It was his latest attempt to push back against allegations made by U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and some white minority groups in South Africa.\n\nSouth African-born Musk, who has regularly accused South Africa’s Black-led government of being anti-white, repeated a claim this weekend in a social media post that some of the country’s political figures are “actively promoting white genocide.”\n\nWATCH: The historical reality of land ownership in South Africa amid Trump’s criticisms\n\nRamaphosa said in his weekly message to the nation that South Africans “should not allow events beyond our shores to divide us or turn us against each other.”\n\n“In particular, we should challenge the completely false narrative that our country is a place in which people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution.”\n\nRamaphosa did not mention names, but his denial was a reference to the allegations by Trump and others that South Africa is deliberately mistreating a white minority group known as Afrikaners by encouraging violent attacks on their farms and introducing a law designed to seize their land.\n\nThe allegations were central to an executive order issued by Trump last month cutting funding to South Africa to punish the government, while offering Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S.\n\nAfrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa more than 300 years ago. They were at the heart of the apartheid government that systematically oppressed non-whites, although South Africa has been largely successful at reconciling its many racial groups after apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn his post on X, influential Trump adviser Musk cited a political rally last Friday in South Africa where Black leaders of a far-left opposition party sang a song that has the lyrics “Kill the Boer, the farmer.” Boer is a word that refers to an Afrikaner.\n\n“Very few people know that there is a major political party in South Africa that is actively promoting white genocide,” Musk wrote. He linked to a video of the rally.\n\nThe party in question, the Economic Freedom Fighters, is the fourth biggest in Parliament and a political opponent of Ramaphosa’s African National Congress. It won 9.5% of the vote in last year’s national election. It has come under scrutiny for stirring racial tensions before and for singing the song, which was used during apartheid as a call to fight against oppression.\n\nThe song’s modern-day use has been criticized by some in South Africa, including by other political parties, and a group representing Afrikaners challenged its use in court. It was ruled hate speech and effectively banned by a court more than a decade ago.\n\nBut it was the subject of several other legal cases before a 2022 ruling found that it was not hate speech and protected under freedom of speech because there was no proof it incited violence.\n\nSince Trump’s executive order, the South African government has sought to dispel what it says is misinformation over white farmers, who are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes. The government has condemned the attacks, but experts say there is no evidence of any widespread targeting of whites and they are in fact part of South Africa’s extremely high violent crime rates, which affect all races.\n\nThe group representing Afrikaners says the police have sometimes undercounted farm homicides in official statistics. It recently said it had figures showing there were eight farm homicides in the three-month period between October and December last year when police only recorded one.\n\nThere was a total of 6,953 homicides across South Africa during that same time period, according to the police statistics.\n\nAssociated Press writer Mogomotsi Magome in Johannesburg contributed to this report.",

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "content": "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.\n\nDeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn’t set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has operated as an independent entity since 1970. It has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.\n\nWATCH: The potential impact of a Trump takeover of USPS\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Trump’s first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.\n\nDeJoy’s tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.\n\nUSPS employs about 640,000 workers. The USPS has been largely self-funded since 1970. .\n\n“I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,” DeJoy said in a statement.\n\nHe added that “much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.”\n\nThe National Association of Letter Carriers’ president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.\n\n“The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,” Renfroe said.\n\nREAD MORE: USPS says it will work with DOGE on reform, including workforce cuts\n\nThe Postal Service Board of Governors said in a statement Monday evening that they had retained global search firm Egon Zehnder to help find the agency’s next leader. There’s no established timeline for when the announcement of the next postmaster general will be made, the statement said.\n\nEarlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he’d do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.\n\nUSPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.\n\nCritics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.\n\nUSPS employs about 640,000 workers who deliver mail, medicine, election ballots and packages across the country, from inner cities to rural areas and far-flung islands.\n\nThe USPS has been largely self-funded since 1970. The bulk of its annual $78.5 billion budget comes from customer fees, according to the Congressional Research Service. Congress provides a relatively small annual appropriation — about $50 million in fiscal year 2023 — to subsidize free and reduced-cost mail services.",

        "content": "Wisconsin’s upcoming Supreme Court race is just entering its final stretch and it’s already breaking records as the most expensive judicial election in the nation’s history. The April 1 contest between liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel has drawn millions of dollars in outside money — most notably from billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading the administration’s efforts to dramatically slash the size of the federal government.\n\nREAD MORE: As Musk takes prominent role in Trump White House, violent attacks on Tesla dealerships spike\n\nAs the first election since Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed his agenda on the country, the race will serve as a crucial early barometer of how voters are feeling about his second term — testing the mood of the electorate and the enthusiasm of both parties in a critical battleground state.\n\nHere’s what to know about the race:\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe April 1 election will determine whether liberals maintain control of the state’s highest court as it prepares to rule on a series of high-profile cases, including one involving the validity of a 1849 law that would effectively outlaw abortion, and others involving public sector unions ‘ collective bargaining rights and voting rules.\n\nThe makeup of the court could have major implications for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election in the battleground state.\n\nThe court could, for instance, hear challenges to the state’s congressional maps, which could theoretically swing the balance of power in Washington if they are redrawn considerably.\n\nBut beyond local issues, the race is serving as an early test of Democratic enthusiasm heading into the midterm elections — as well as how Republicans will perform without Trump on the ballot\n\nIt’s also providing a preview of how both parties may position themselves in elections next year. Republicans have focused on Trump and his agenda, while Democrats have tried to turn the race into a referendum on Musk, whom polling shows is unpopular in the state.\n\nHow much money has been spent?\n\nMore than $73 million has already been spent the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice. That breaks the previous record, which was set in 2023 when candidates and outside groups spent more than $51 million in the last Wisconsin Supreme Court race that became a referendum on abortion rights after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe biggest spender, by far, has been Musk. Groups funded by the world’s richest man have so far spent more than $14 million to boost Schimel’s candidacy, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nMusk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on Thursday, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel’s campaign.\n\nCrawford has also also received her own support from billionaires, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nHow are both side running?\n\nFor supporters of Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate and former Republican attorney general, it’s all about Trump. Conservatives have cast the race as a chance for the president’s loyal supporters to back him once more, ensure his agenda is enacted and push back against liberal judges they accuse of working to stymie his plans.\n\nMailers from Musk’s America PAC, for instance, feature photographs of the president and plead that, “President Donald Trump needs your vote.” Others warn that “Liberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump’s agenda.”\n\nSchimel, who was endorsed by Trump on Friday night, has also aligned himself with the president. He posed recently with a giant Trump inflatable and joined the president’s eldest son on stage at a get-out-the-vote rally.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are hoping to channel their voters’ outrage and anger by casting the race as an opportunity opportunity to stand up to Musk.\n\nCrawford repeatedly invoked Musk during a recent debate, going as far as to refer to her opponent as “Elon Schimel.” The state Democratic Party has branded the race “The People v. Musk” and has hosted a series of anti-Musk town halls, including one featuring former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz.\n\n“Don’t let Elon buy the Supreme Court,” read billboards that depict Musk as Schimel’s puppeteer.\n\nWho is expected to win?\n\nBoth sides say the race is extremely close and will depend on who can best turn out their voters in an off-year so soon after a presidential race.\n\nWisconsin is one of the nation’s evenly divided states. Trump won by less than a percentage point, or fewer than 30,000 votes.\n\nIn 2023, the conservative candidate lost by more than 10 points, putting liberals in charge of the court for the first time in 15 years.",

That comes as the United Nations has decided to temporarily scale back about a third of its footprint in Gaza after a recent Israeli strike hit one of its compounds.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has been bombarding Gaza in recent days.

        "content": "HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — Israeli authorities released an Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was detained by the army after being attacked by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, who his wife said beat him in front of his home while filming the assault.\n\nHamdan Ballal and the other directors of “No Other Land,” which looks at the struggles of living under Israeli occupation, had mounted the stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month when it won the award for best documentary film.\n\nREAD MORE: UN says it will reduce staff in Gaza after Israeli tank strike killed employee\n\nBallal and two other Palestinians detained with him were released Tuesday afternoon from a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes, and the three were driven to a hospital in the neighboring Palestinian city of Hebron, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene.\n\nTheir attorney, Lea Tsemel, said they spent the night on the floor of a military base while receiving only minimal care for their injuries from the attack.\n\nShe had earlier said they were accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations they deny.\n\nPalestinian residents say around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns and some in military uniforms — attacked the West Bank village of Susiya on Monday evening as residents were breaking their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nSoldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones, they said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation. On Tuesday, it referred further queries to police, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n‘I’m dying!’\n\nLamia Ballal, the director’s wife, said she heard her husband being beaten outside their home as she huddled inside with their three children. She heard him screaming, “I’m dying!” and calling for an ambulance. When she looked out the window, she saw three men in uniform beating Ballal with the butts of their rifles and another person in civilian clothes who appeared to be filming the violence.\n\n“Of course, after the Oscar, they have come to attack us more,” Lamia said. “I felt afraid.”\n\nWest Bank settlers are often armed and sometimes wear military-style clothing that makes it difficult to distinguish them from soldiers.\n\nOn Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside their home, and the car’s windshield and windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.\n\nFilm looked at Palestinians’ struggle to stay on the land\n\n“No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.\n\nThe joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened it.\n\nBasel Adra, another of the film’s co-directors who is a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there’s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.\n\nREAD MORE: Thousands of Palestinians flee West Bank homes as Israel confronts militants\n\n“Nobody can do anything to stop the pogroms, and soldiers are only there to facilitate and help the attacks,” he said. “We’re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank … Nobody’s stopping this.”\n\nMasked settlers with sticks also attacked Jewish activists in the area on Monday, smashing their car windows and slashing tires, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence. Video provided by the group showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.\n\nOpen-ended military rule\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.\n\nThe Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards — and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.\n\nThe Palestinians also face threats from settlers at nearby outposts. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually turn a blind eye to settler attacks or intervene on behalf of the settlers.\n\nThe war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — A magazine journalist’s account of being added to a group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled.\n\nWATCH: Top Trump officials accidentally included reporter in Yemen strike chat on commercial app\n\nAtlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg detailed a discussion that happened over the Signal messaging app hours before strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen order by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic” and that it is looking into how a journalist’s number was added to the chain.\n\nHere’s a look at the app in question.\n\nWhat is Signal?\n\nIt’s an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls.\n\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls.\n\nIn other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.\n\nSignal’s encryption protocol is open source, meaning anyone that it’s freely available for anyone to inspect, use or modify. The encryption protocol is also used by another popular chat service, social media company Meta’s WhatsApp platform.\n\nEncryption on Signal is turned on by default, unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, which requires users to turn it on and does not make it available for group chats.\n\nSignal has features that are found on other messaging apps. It allows users to host group chats with up to 1,000 people and messages can be set to automatically disappear after a certain time.\n\nIs it secure?\n\nSignal touts the privacy of its service — and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.\n\nBut it could be hacked.\n\nGovernment officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings, but in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to notify someone that they should check for a classified message sent through other means.\n\nWATCH: Trump says he knew ‘nothing’ about report on officials texting war plans to journalist\n\nBeyond concerns about security, Signal and other similar apps may allow users to skirt open records laws. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren’t returned under public information requests.\n\nIn the Atlantic article, Goldberg wrote that some messages were set to disappear after one week and some after four.\n\nDo other government officials use Signal?\n\nEncrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, according to a recent Associated Press review.\n\nState, local and federal officials in nearly every state have accounts on encrypted messaging apps, according to the review, which found many of those accounts registered to government cellphone numbers. Some were also registered to personal numbers.\n\nWho’s behind Signal?\n\nThe app’s origins date back more than a decade, when it was set up by an entrepreneur who goes by the name Moxie Marlinspike, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup to the social media company. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.\n\nThe nonprofit Signal Foundation was set up in 2018 to support the app’s operations as well as “investigate the future of private communication,” according to the foundation’s website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit “with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.”\n\nThe foundation’s board has five members, including Brian Acton, who cofounded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.\n\nAssociated Press writers Tara Copp, Aamer Madhani and Eric Tucker contributed to this report from Washington.",

        "content": "Lee Zeldin, the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t kidding around. He’s spoilin’ for some despoilin’, and he doesn’t care who knows it. From :\n\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.” Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nBecause, as we know, there is no public cost to environmentally inflicted disease or industrial pollution.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nGive Zeldin credit. He may have decided that his job is to help Republican donors poison the whole damn country, but he has by God learned his lines well.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.” Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the average American corporation doesn’t have the social conscience God gave the Gaboon viper. Now that attitude has a friendly administration. Zeldin’s brief is to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from doing anything substantive to protect the environment. Here is what passes for optimism.\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nFirst of all, Zeldin and the administration couldn’t care less about what is said in the “process” of public comment, and they will pull their environmental and economic justifications for the despoilin’ out of the collected works of Professor Otto Yerass. And nobody will be there to stop them. And not for nothing, as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse points out, Zeldin probably lied during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nNot that anyone who matters cares. Rivers will die now, choked to death by Fox News talking points.\n\n",

        "title": "“Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!” Says the Leader of the Free World",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nThere is an angry talking yam loose in Our Nation’s Capital, and we all ought to be calling our congresscritters to tell them not to go out without armed guards and huge amounts of anti-yam repellent. On Thursday, it was reported that the Department of Defense would be briefing a certain unelected ketamine proponent on the country’s secret war plans for a possible conflict with China. The angry talking yam began storming around Pennsylvania Avenue, eating its own liver.\n\nElon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War, according to the Failing New York Times, one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China, that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and ‘spill the beans.’ RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story, which is probably libelous, and went heavy with it. Fortunately, nobody was watching!\n\nMaggot Hagerman, the really dumb ‘scammer’ who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who I haven’t spoken to in ages, is a big part of the Scam. She lead the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, only to realize that she was duped and got it wrong. She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting. The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE…And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\n\nYou may be comforted by the fact that “Elon” indeed will not be briefed by “the Department of War,” which we haven’t had since 1947. And, anyway, Henry Knox has been dead since 1806 and is therefore unavailable for private briefings. The vulgar talking yam continues to stalk the Beltway, howling in all caps until hell won’t even have it.\n\nOver at the White House, they’ve appointed a new liaison to NASA, which once represented all that was smart and good—and, in all honesty, white—about America. His name is Darren Bossie, and he worked for the first iteration of the West Wing of Hell. He is a young man of vast experience, as The New Yorker pointed out.\n\nDarren Bossie, the new White House liaison to NASA, arrived shortly after Trump’s Inauguration. Bossie was more or less unknown at the agency, but employees soon found his LinkedIn profile. He had spent four of the past seven years bouncing around conservative politics, with a stint as Trump’s White House liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and had worked as a senior consultant for unnamed companies. For the bulk of his professional life, however—from 2006 to 2018—he had been an assistant manager at a Total Wine & More in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\n“That didn’t seem very promising,” a senior NASA official told me.\n\nCan’t put anything past those guys.\n\nHowever, young Bossie prompted additional interest in those of us who have been tracking conservative ratfcking for a while.\n\nA review of public records, however, suggested that Darren is the brother of David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United—the conservative group whose litigation before the Supreme Court empowered mega-donors and corporations to make unlimited contributions to political candidates.\n\nBoy howdy has David Bossie left a long trail of fcked rats behind him. He made his bones with his infamous activities against candidate, and then president, Bill Clinton. David Bossie was the guy who forced his way into the hospital room where a woman was ministering to her husband who had suffered a stroke. The woman’s daughter, Susan Coleman, had committed suicide, and Bossie claimed to believe the hoax that Coleman had killed herself because Clinton had gotten her pregnant. Bossie’s tactics have managed to get him condemned by President George H.W. Bush, fired as a congressional investigator, and even marked lousy by the first Trump administration for profiteering off the president’s image. (That’s the president’s job, dammit.) However, he forever will be a conservative hero because he was one of the leaders of a political activist outfit called Citizens United, which was used to demolish any possibility of sensible political financial reform, perhaps forever. So we all have to deal with the Bossie family again because you can’t get away from Republican buccaneering even in outer space.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Empire State Express” (Son House): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from the Roaring (if goofy) Twenties, are some popular British party games. The “forfeit” of having to sit on a bottle while attempting to light a cigarette seems to be a lot harder than you’d think it was. Just hazarding a guess here that some gin was involved off camera. On the other hand, this looks like the original source material for Eyes Wide Shut. History is so cool.\n\nMy God, this is an historic first. From Washington Monthly:\n\nMaybe it’s time for J.D. Vance to face some questions. Vance’s favorability is worse than Harris’s at the same two-month mark and perhaps worse than any new vice president in the history of polling. His Real Clear Politics favorable-unfavorable rating is 41.7 percent-44.8 percent, a slightly worse net favorable rating (-3.1 percentage points) than Donald Trump’s (-0.9). When looking only at March polling—sampled after his infamous Oval Office hectoring of Ukraine’s president—he’s even more underwater: 42.4 percent-48.0 percent.\n\nThis is pure instinctive revulsion. Vance hasn’t really done anything yet except run his mouth, get booed at the Kennedy Center, and Be There, and that’s apparently been enough.\n\nA Vance ’28 campaign, I suspect, will be bogged down with immense baggage from his current stint in the public sector, without the ability to lean on any record of success in the private sector—save for a profitable book with a message that has no resemblance to anything Vance peddles today. If Trump taps a namesake to carry on his legacy, Vance will lose out on the party’s MAGA base.\n\nI think they’ve never trusted his naked ambition and, as the president appears to continue down the road of cognitive deterioration, he’s going to get blamed for every story out of the White House about how the president is headed for La La Land. Can’t say I blame the cult for this, either.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Popular Mechanics:\n\nArchaeologists excavating a private property in Florence, Italy, discovered a 20-inch statue of Hercules missing its head, though not altogether headless. Despite no cranium on the Greek hero, the statue included details from Hercules’ mythic 12 labors, including the skin of the Nemean lion and the severed head of the Cretan bull. The statue was dated to between the middle and late Imperial age from the third to fourth centuries, A.D., according to a translated report from Italian media, making it a roughly 1,700 find. The diminutive statue depicts a nude Hercules leaning to his right on his club, adorned with the trophies from his labors. According to Greek mythology, the Oracle of Delphi advised Hercules to travel to Tiryns to serve his cousin, King Eurystheus of Mycenae, for 12 years, for which he would be rewarded with immortality.\n\nAnd I guess, in one way, ol’ Herc was rewarded. All it cost was his head.\n\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nA new species of dinosaur found at a Mongolian building site has the largest fully preserved claw ever found. The bipedal, herbivorous animal had only two fingers on each hand, which it may have used to grasp branches and pull them towards its mouth. The 90-million-year-old fossil—which included parts of the pelvis, both arms and hands, and numerous vertebrae—was found near Khanbogd in the Gobi desert in 2012, but it has only now been properly studied and given the scientific name Duonychus tsogtbaatari. The genus name means “two claws” and the species name honours Mongolian palaeontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.\n\nThe researchers think the claws were an adaptation to grabbing and pulling down vegetation. With fewer fingers, each one could be stronger and more flexible, allowing for a tighter, more controlled grip, says Kobayashi. “The curved claws and extreme flexion suggest it could hook onto branches or clusters of leaves more easily,” he says. “Three fingers might have just gotten in the way, while two provided a more precise and efficient grasp.”\n\nGiant claws used merely to grab leaves? What a waste. I’m sure they can clean that up for the next movie. They lived, healthily and regularly, with plenty of roughage, to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in LA, now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

        "title": "Trump’s Call to Annex Canada as a State Should Have Invoked the 25th Amendment",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What has become plain this week is that the entire administration has committed itself to the president’s pipe dream of annexing Canada as the 51st state. It wasn’t just the president’s bizarre appearance with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, in which the president took a short stroll around the Izonkosphere.\n\n“Canada only works as a state. … This would be the most incredible country visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S., just a straight artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many, many decades ago, and makes no sense.”\n\nIt is necessary at this point to mention that the so-called “artificial line” is usually referred to as a “border.” The president seems to grasp the concept when referring to the “artificial line” separating the United States and Mexico. Strange, that. The president went on.\n\n“It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state. I love [O, Canada]. I think it’s great. Keep it, but it will be for the state, one of our greatest states, maybe our greatest state.”\n\nWonderful. He’s going to let them keep their national anthem, one of the world’s most stirring, but only as a state song, like “On the Banks of the Wabash,” “Georgia on My Mind,” or “On, Wisconsin.” I suppose he’ll let them keep their hockey teams, too.\n\nThe whole episode should have brought about an instantaneous Cabinet meeting at which the 25th Amendment was invoked. The president was clearly irrational. Instead, there was Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick seconding the motion. From the Hill:\n\n“The best way, the president has said it, the best way to actually merge the economies of Canada and the United States is for Canada to become our 51st state. If they want to merge it, that’s how you make it the 51st state,” Lutnick said on Fox Business Network’s Varney & Co.\n\nIt really is a cult, you know.\n\nOn the Bluesky app, journalist and author Garrett Epps shrewdly pointed out that in Fletcher Knebel’s Night of Camp David, one of the first manifestations of President Mark Hollenbach’s mental illness was his secret desire to merge the United States and Canada—as well as all of Scandanavia—into a single entity called “Aspen.” In fact, the book was reissued during the first Trump administration, and it was referenced on TV by both Rachel Maddow and Bob Woodward. Now, though, with the president’s grand design seeming to parallel the grandiose foreign-policy proposal of the fictional President Hollenbach, the book has taken on an even greater salience.\n\n(By the way, the hero of the book is a young, ambitious first-term senator named James McVeagh with whom the crazy president shares his notions in the aforementioned night at Camp David. Maybe you can see J. Divan Vance in that role, but I can’t.)\n\nIn the novel, the crazy president sounds almost rational in explaining the irrational.\n\n“Canada is the wealthiest nation on earth.” Hollenbach’s words raced after each other. …“The mineral riches under her soil are incredible in their immensity. Even with modern demands, they are well-nigh inexhaustible. Believe me, Jim, Canada will be the seat of power in the next century and, properly exploited and conserved, her riches can go for a thousand years. ...\n\n.. But the merger of know-how, power, and character, the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia, the new nation under one parliament and one president could keep the peace for centuries. The president of the union should be the man who dreamed the dreams of giants. ...\n\n… “I only exclude Europe at the start,” said Hollenbach, and his face quickly lighted again. “Right now, Europe has nothing to give us. But once we have built the fortress of Aspen, I predict the nations of Europe will pound at the door to get in. And, if they don’t, we’ll have the power to force them into the new nation. … There are other kinds of pressure, trade duties and barriers, financial measures, economic sanctions, if you will. But, never fear, Jim. England, France, Germany, and the Low Countries, too, can be brought to heel.\n\nWhen Knebel wrote his classic Seven Days in May, about an attempted military junta in Washington, he was drawing on inside knowledge about the turmoil in the Kennedy administration between the president, the Joint Chiefs, and the intelligence community—turmoil that would do a lot to feed suspicions after the president’s murder in 1963. JFK was a big fan of the book, so much that he allowed director John Frankenheimer to photograph the White House so he could make the sets for his film adaptation.\n\nIn the case of Night of Camp David, Knebel was able to draw on American attempts to absorb Canada that dated back to the founding of the nation. In fact, Article XI of the original Articles of Confederation read as follows:\n\nCanada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union.\n\nThe American Revolution helped the new country break off those parts of British North America in and around the Great Lakes. We tried to seize the entire country in the War of 1812, but we failed, and we got Washington burned in the bargain. Through the years up to the American Civil War, there were annexation groups on both sides of the border.\n\nIn 1860, Secretary of State William Seward came close to annexing the territory from Washington state all the way up to Alaska, which at the time was owned by Russia. For a while, it looked like Great Britain might actually swing for the deal. But,when Seward bought Alaska in 1868, the people in the region began to feel uncomfortable with the U.S. closing in from both the north and south, so popular opinion shifted. Then, of course, there were the Fenians.\n\nThe Fenian Brotherhood was a product of one of the periodic risings in Ireland against British rule. It was the American wing of what was called in Ireland the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The American Fenians were a substantial force. They had money—upwards of $500,000—and weapons and an army made up of veterans of the American Civil War. (They were led by John O’Mahony, who’d fought with the 69th New York, part of the famed Irish Brigade.) After the war, the Fenians launched a series of raids into Canada. They came in two bursts—one in 1866 and another in 1870–71. They occurred all over Canada, from Manitoba to the Maritimes. None of them succeeded, and one of them, a raid around the Minnesota–Manitoba border, never even made it into Canada. The only real result was to strengthen Canadian nationalism; the raids were pivotal in the eventual development of the Canadian confederation in 1867, an arrangement that the current U.S. president believes would make a helluva 51st state. In the debate over forming the confederation, Sir John MacDonald said:\n\nIf we do not take advantage of the time, if we show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it may never return, and we shall hereafter bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed to embrace the happy opportunity now offered of founding a great nation under the fostering care of Great Britain, and our Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria.\n\nOne of MacDonald’s primary concerns while forming the confederation was American meddling, especially in the rebellious western parts of Canada. He wrote to his minister of finance:\n\nI cannot understand the desire of the Colonial Office, or of the Company, to saddle the responsibility of the government on Canada just now. It would so completely throw the game into the hands of the insurgents and the Yankee wirepullers, who are to some extent influencing and directing the movement from St. Paul that we cannot foresee the consequences.\n\nYou always have to watch out for those Yankee wirepullers. Can’t trust them worth a damn.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Subscribe here.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "It may be the distraction everybody says it is. It may be a shot across the bow from a corrupt president against investigators who might choose to inconvenience him. It could be both of those. But the release Tuesday of nearly 70,000 pages of heretofore classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy is an early Easter basket full of very interesting accounts of the covert doings of the CIA in the 1960s. And whatever the motives behind their release may be, it is all information that we should have had years ago. The good people at the National Security Archive have sorted through much of the massive information dump and filtered out some very tasty nuggets. For example:\n\nThere is a “family jewels” memo to William Colby dated June 1, 1973, at the height of the revelations regarding the CIA’s history of international dirty tricks. This one begins with a genuinely hilarious spasm of bureaucratic linguistic gymnastics.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone’s files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA’s charter.\n\nA special kind of motivation like, say, telling the country what was being done in its name. Like, say, burglarizing a foreign embassy in Washington.\n\nAs a result of a developing relationship with Philippe de Vosjoli, the SDECE representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by Anatole Golitson, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from the French Consulate.\n\nAlthough certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection against foreign installation in this country.\n\n“Which assumes a new significance today”? Oh, please, do go on.\n\nFinally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone’s dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.\n\nHoly Borgias, Batman. My eyebrows are on the ceiling.\n\nThere’s also a 40-page document detailing CIA meddling in elections all over the globe, as well as with a rising revolutionary movement in Yemen.\n\nAnd there’s an oblique mention that’s going to ring all kinds of bells among Oliver Stone fans.\n\nAlso in the afternoon, the Deputy Director (Plans) read to the Panel a paper on Operation Mongoose which the Director had used earlier in the day for briefing the President. This paper was used on the instruction of the Director. The Panel asked questions about agency activity in Cuba, all of which were answered with the exception of one having to do with the role of the Attorney General. This query was raised by Mr. [Gordon] Gray who recognized and gracefully accepted the fact that he not answered directly.\n\nMr. Gray, who had been the National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration, thus gets a gold star for being incurious.\n\nAgain, there’s very likely nothing in here that will tell us much about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But there’s a great deal to be said for setting the scene, and the American intelligence community was a cynical, occasionally criminal, gang. The more we know about that, the better, and the more evidence we have that JFK had the right idea in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs came a cropper. A thousand pieces, and scattered to the winds.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "America is a great country because every foul-tempered has-been hack can grow up to be president. From Politico:\n\n“I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,” Rahm I. Emanuel, operative-turned-politician-turned-diplomat told me before adding his stock line since returning from serving as ambassador to Japan. “I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me.”\n\nI’m telling you, Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s Jonathan Martin is positively aglow at the thought of this boorish triangulator back in the spotlight. In the immortal words of the late Mr. Zappa—“Oooh, gooey, dripping, steaming!”\n\nSince coming home in January from his stint in Tokyo—a job he repurposed to be American envoy to all of Asia—Emanuel has been as visible as any other Democrat. Never mind that he currently holds no office and hasn’t been on a ballot for a decade. Name the political podcast and Emanuel has likely been on it or will be shortly. He immediately snagged a CNN contract and regular Washington Post column, no small accomplishment for a former official at a moment of retrenchment for news organizations. He’s also hitting the lecture circuit, appearing for paid and gratis gigs before audiences such as the Realtors and the Chicago Economic Club. Emanuel is pointedly avoiding Ivy League campuses and later this month will make his first stop on a service academy tour when he speaks at West Point. Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy.\n\nI cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base. He is now recasting himself as the man with all the grown-up concerns. He’s following the recent trail blazed by Gavin Newsom, except that, unlike Newsom, Emanuel isn’t directly attacking a segment of the trans community. He’s asking the Democrats to blow past the issue entirely, and it’s making Jonathan Martin positively giddy.\n\n“I am done with the discussion of locker rooms, I am done with the discussion of bathrooms and we better start having a conversation about the classroom,” Emanuel said, drawing applause as he alluded to a new study showing more than two-thirds of eighth graders can’t read at grade level. He kept coming back to the study and eventually and explicitly tied the policy to the politics, in Rahm’ian fashion.\n\nOoooh, he has his own adjective now. Do go on.\n\nShortly after his trip to Washington, Emanuel dashed out to Los Angeles to appear on Bill Maher’s show, where he went even further for a less sober audience. “In seventh grade, if I had known I could’ve said the word ‘they’ and gotten in the girls’ bathroom, I would’ve done it,” he said. “We literally are a superpower, we’re facing off against China with 1.4 billion people and two-thirds of our children can’t read eighth grade level.”\n\nThere it all was, in two appearances. Emanuel’s gift for finding a towering issue hidden in plain view; his tactical skills for grasping the political benefits it could confer, delivered with a snappy sound bite to elevate statistics off the page; linking domestic policy to geopolitics and sending a message about another, more controversial topic; and not merely urging Democrats to move on from trans youth issues, but using them as a vehicle to shift the conversation to ground he, and most in his party, would prefer to fight on. Gavin, are you listening?\n\nChristmighty, get a room, will you?\n\nFor the record, Emanuel's history with public education is...how you say?...spotty. As mayor of Chicago, he went to war with the city's teachers and their unions. In 2012, 26,000 members walked out in protest of stalled negotiations on a new contract. The strike went on for seven days despite Emanuel's failed attempt to get a court to order the teachers back to work, and the teachers cleaned his clock. The strike was so successful that it is credited with a revival of unionism in America generally, and with breaking the bipartisan consensus on education \"reform,\" particularly in the area of standardized testing, which has lost a great deal of its allure.\n\nIn fact, Emanuel's tenure as mayor of Chicago unquestionably will be the focus of all the oppo should he actually run for president, and the most fruitful area of research will be Emanuel's relationship to the renegade Chicago Police Department. (How renegade? The Guardian revealed that the CPD was running what essentially was a black site in an old warehouse.) It was his pattern to deflect and stonewall on police accountability until cornered by the weight of public outcry and/or the power of a federal investigation. At which point, Emanuel would make a great show of getting \"out in front\" of the issue. The classic case was the police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald in 2014. From Bloomberg:\n\nBy the time of the 2015 deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Sandra Bland in Texas—both of whom died under questionable circumstances while in police custody—the BLM cause was ascendant. And nowhere did a collision between BLM and the police seem more inevitable at that point than in Chicago, where evidence of decades of police corruption and brutality concerning Black and Latino civilians was surfacing, and it was beyond refutation.\n\n\n\nThis was the political climate that greeted Emanuel as he started his second term as mayor in mid-2015, and he could have gotten in front of the policing issue before a clash happened. Instead, just months into that term, he antagonized both sides. At an October 2015 White House gathering of law enforcement officials, Emanuel said Chicago police officers had gone “fetal”—that they were shrinking back in their public safety duties because of social media-driven backlash to police brutality, or out of fear they’d get caught on live-streaming services doing something shady. In that one statement, he scapegoated police reform activists and infantilized the police force.\n\nThis, I guess, is what Politico would call Emanuel’s tactical skills for grasping political benefits.\n\nI guess that’s what Politico would call Rahm’ian fashion. And then I, for one, will throw up.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "content": "Attributed to the late Casey Stengel, and in reference to the 1962 New York Mets, who reached heretofore unprecedented depth in their mediocrity, this not only gave the late Jimmy Breslin a great title for a book on the team but also blessed the English language with a glorious idiom for abject incompetence.\n\n“Can’t anybody here play this game?” Casey lamented.\n\nCasey died in 1975, but I’m sure that, wherever he’s sitting in heaven’s Malaprop Cafe, he wouldn’t mind if we applied his existential musings to the current presidential administration—specifically, in this case, to the Department of Defense and its current jefe, Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff while sober. From The Atlantic:\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. This is going to require some explaining.\n\nI would think so.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nWhew. Paranoia strikes deep. Sufficient to out current moment, of course. But one thing we can be sure of is that, if the administration did set up a Veritas-style ratfck, they were better-than-even money to screw it up. And one of the ways we know that is that the actual facts of this particular situation are a spectacular example of utter incompetence.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.” A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.” ...\n\n\n\n... The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nThe gob, it is smacked.\n\nThese guys organized a meeting to discuss a military strike and nobody thought to ask, “Gee, fellas, isn’t it kind of weird that we invited the editor of The Atlantic to this top-secret strategy conference?” Or nobody bothered to check the call list, and I guess we’re lucky they didn’t invite Oprah or Jim Cantore.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nDon’t just take his word for it.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe answer to the Stengel Question is, in this case, nobody.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Ordinarily, I stay away from the continuing forensic analysis of What the Fck Happened? The election was four months ago. The consequences are drowning us, and it’s hard enough keeping up with the fresh hell unleashed every day to go back and discuss how we all got here. However, in The New York Times on Tuesday, pollster named David Shor, and eventually they came around to a conclusion to which Shor had come from his polling. It is one of the most depressing pieces of dialogue I’ve read in a while.\n\nKLEIN: One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. This is something I was told by top Biden strategists. I don’t see democracy on here or Jan. 6 and the stability of the system. Did you test those, as well?\n\nSHOR: We did. But we did a survey where we just asked people: What’s more important right now—preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives? It was 78 to 18: delivering change that improves people’s lives. One of the hardest things about being a political consultant over the last eight years is that every day Trump does terrible things—things that I think are objectively awful and scary and that [expletive] me off. Things he says, like: I’m going to prosecute my enemies. Then we do a bunch of tests, and voters really don’t want to hear about it from us. I think Trump would do better if he didn’t say those things, for sure. But voters want politicians to talk about concrete ways that they are going to improve people’s lives.\n\nAll my life, it was a given that the more democratic a system was, the better off the people would be. Hell, that was the stated reason for almost all our military and intelligence misadventures of the past 80 years. Both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson proposed economic aid for Vietnam even as they deepened American military involvement in the hopes of stimulating some sort of democratic government in Indochina. (See also: The Quiet American.) It was the stated reason for the grandiose Middle East fantasies of the PNAC crowd during the aughts. When was it that the country stopped believing that? When did we decide, en masse, that democracy and “improving people’s lives” contradicted each other? Personally, I trace it back to Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural address, which supercharged the conservative dogma that “government” was somehow an alien entity and not the creation of a commonwealth in which we all had a stake and to which we had an obligation.\n\nRegulars here at the shebeen know that I am fond of Daniel Webster’s caution against simplifying government.\n\nNothing is more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many qualified rights.\n\nThe stake we all have in a political commonwealth, and to which we have obligations, can be found in those words. In the chat between Klein and Shor can be found the death of that commonwealth. Everything else is a symptom.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The good folks at the Brennan Center for Justice have delivered a helpful primer on the Alien Enemies Act, that dusty, tattered old fig leaf being used by the administration to cover itself for its new mass deportation project. You will be shocked, I’m sure, to learn that the administration is misusing this Revolution-era relic to serve the president’s own mad purposes.\n\nAs the Supreme Court and past presidents have acknowledged, the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority enacted and implemented under the war power. When the Fifth Congress passed the law and the Wilson administration defended it in court during World War I, they did so on the understanding that noncitizens with connections to a foreign belligerent could be “treated as prisoners of war” under the “rules of war under the law of nations.” In the Constitution and other late-1700s statutes, the term invasion is used literally, typically to refer to large-scale attacks. The term predatory incursion is also used literally in writings of that period to refer to slightly smaller attacks like the 1781 Raid on Richmond led by American defector Benedict Arnold.\n\nToday, some anti-immigration politicians and groups urge a non-literal reading of invasion and predatory incursion so that the Alien Enemies Act can be invoked in response to unlawful migration and cross-border narcotics trafficking. These politicians and groups view the Alien Enemies Act as a turbocharged deportation authority. But their proposed reading of the law is at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice, all of which confirm that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority. Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse.\n\nThe problem is that there is enough leaky precedent regarding the use of this law for the administration to use for its own purposes. (For example, President Truman used it to extend wartime detentions and deportations until 1951.) Moreover, as the Brennan report makes clear, there is a yawning loophole through which the courts can dive if they choose to do so.\n\nThe courts should strike down any attempted peacetime use of the Alien Enemies Act, but the political question doctrine may prevent them from doing so. This doctrine cautions the courts against addressing issues that fall within Congress and the president’s constitutional duties and that lack judicially manageable standards for resolution. The courts have used the political question doctrine to avoid resolving claims that touch on matters of war and peace, as well as other sensitive foreign policy matters.\n\nNevertheless, this was a law that was an offense against the Constitution almost from birth. It was part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, President John Adams’s lasting gift to future American autocrats that Thomas Jefferson deemed to be part of the “reign of witches.” In fact, the Alien Enemies Act is the only one of those noxious statutes still on the books, as the Brennan Center said in an earlier report, because it was the only one of those acts without a “sunset” clause. Attempts to repeal it have failed, repeatedly. So like the Espionage Act and other laws enacted to respond to temporary (or imaginary) threats, it sits in our laws like a sleeping virus awaiting another outbreak, like this one.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "content": "Sooner or later, probably when this administration looks around and sees that there is nothing left of the old republic to destroy, the foreign owners and the editors of Tiger Beat on the Potomac will stop being so goddamn fascinated by the techniques that it employed to do so. If there ever was going to be a final example of the dangers of value-free, nonjudgmental political reporting, it’s been the performance of America’s most prominent foreign-owned political tip sheet.\n\nMonday morning’s lead item was a perfect example. It was a bloodless examination of how well Elon Musk and Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought are working an “outside-inside” strategy to destroy the federal government.\n\nMusk, the impulsive Silicon Valley billionaire, provides the public face to the bureaucracy-slashing efforts and takes the heat for the budget-cratering, employee-firing, and overall havoc-wreaking that has been unleashed on the federal government. Vought, the conservative budget wonk, brings the expertise, insider knowledge, and ideology to a dramatic downsizing that both men see as necessary and transformational, four former Trump administration officials told POLITICO.\n\nIs “havoc-wreaking” a bad thing that ought to be deplored? Not their department, says Politico. And Vought was considered a fringe crackpot until he got the money to carry out his fantasies and the ear of a president who doesn’t know anything about anything. Now the richest man in the world and a career apparatchik, both in the employ of a grifter in chief and working with a congressional majority apparently assimilated into the ruling Borg, have managed to wreck the place with impunity. Again, I ask, is havoc-wreaking a bad thing? I always thought it was. But then again, I’m not a “former Trump administration official.” Fine sourcing there.\n\nOne of the former administration officials called Musk a “game changer” for Vought. Without Musk, “it would have been more confined to what OMB can do versus sending roving gangs of people to the agencies and doing, like, a hostile takeover,” the former official said.\n\nGreat. Bureaucratic thuggery in service of a shakedown and a “hostile takeover” of agencies that actually belong to all of us. Is this a bad thing? Not our department, says Politico.\n\nBut critics argue that approach has been sloppy, cruel, and chaotic, leaving many federal workers fearful of whether they’ll have a job when they show up to work the next morning and slashing budgets that they say provide necessary services. Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said that Musk’s “reign of chaos furthers much of what Vought desires” but doubted whether what he called their “marriage of convenience” would last.\n\n“Critics argue” whether the approach has been “sloppy” and “chaotic”? And some head of a non-profit you’ve never heard of thinks a Musk–Vought split is somehow inevitable. My God, you don’t have to be a “critic” to “argue” that there aren’t “tens of millions” of people over 100 receiving Social Security, or that firing 350 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, and then trying to hire them back only to find that nobody had thought to obtain their current contact information, was no way to run a government. And waiting for the Musk–Vought schism is not a tenable strategy for the survival of democratic government.\n\nNot their department, says Politico.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Something interesting is happening in the chambers of the Supreme Court. The Nine Wise Souls are preparing to hear the case of Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board v. Drummond and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond. At issue is a decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that denied public funding for a Catholic virtual charter school on the grounds that all the state’s charter schools must by law be public schools and that funding religious charter schools is unconstitutional. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal in the last week of April. At the time, Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to participate in that decision. She did so without explanation.\n\nBarrett, who handed Donald Trump a conservative 6–3 supermajority when she was confirmed to the court, won’t be on the bench to hear it. She recused herself, leaving no explanation for sitting out what could be the most significant legal decision to affect schools in decades. Observers believe the cause is her friendship with Garnett, who was an early legal adviser to the school. Nicole and her husband Richard Garnett, also a Notre Dame law professor, are both faculty fellows with the university’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which represents St Isidore. In a deep irony, the longtime friendship between the two women, forged in Catholic faith and a conservative approach to jurisprudence, now threatens to tip the scales away from a cause Garnett has spent her career defending.\n\nSimply put, with Barrett’s recusal, it is now possible that the Court will split, 4–4, in which case the decision of the Oklahoma supremes would stand and the funding would be denied. This would come as an immense shock to the conservative Catholic legal community centered these days at Notre Dame.\n\nAt Notre Dame, Garnett and Barrett overlapped as faculty members for roughly 17 years. “She became a lifelong friend,” Garnett said. “She lived around the corner from us and we raised our kids together.” And when Trump introduced the mother of seven to the nation, Garnett was seated in the Rose Garden along with senators, White House officials and other dignitaries.\n\nGiven their intersecting interests, it’s very likely that school vouchers—a top conservative priority to provide students with public money to spend at non-public schools—came up in conversation. Until 2017, Barrett served as a trustee at Trinity School at Greenlawn, a private classical Christian academy in South Bend, Indiana, that participates in the state’s voucher program. Garnett, meanwhile, was honing legal arguments in favor of expanding such programs. Before joining the faculty at Notre Dame, she worked as a staff attorney for the Institute for Justice, a right-leaning law firm that has led efforts to open school choice programs to religious schools.\n\nWhen one recalls Justice Clarence Thomas’s arrogant refusal to recuse himself from hearing cases involving the January 6 insurrectionists despite his wife’s involvement in some of the surrounding events, Barrett’s decision to recuse herself here looks like high principle. It will look even more like that if one of the four remaining conservatives on the court jumps ship and creates the 4–4 deadlock. Madam Justice Barrett is becoming interesting.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "This may turn out to mean nothing. We’ve had too many experiences with Chief Justice John Roberts in performance as a tower of Jell-O to count any chickens. But there does seem to be a general brawl shaping up between the executive and judicial branches. The president went out of his way to pick a fight on Wednesday by calling for the impeachment of federal district judge James Boasberg, who ordered a two-week pause in the administration’s human-trafficking operation. The president took to his social-media site to explain his reasoning in the sane and lucid manner to which we’ve become accustomed.\n\nThis Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\nLincolnesque, I tells ya.\n\nFor some reason, this spasm set off the Bat Signal in Roberts’s brain, so he did something he almost never has done. He politely told the president to pound sand. From Politico:\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said Tuesday in a rare and brief statement issued just hours after Trump publicly joined demands by his supporters to remove judges he called “crooked.”\n\nBoy, the chief really threw the handbill at him there.\n\nI’m not sure this even qualifies as “pushback.” That will come, if it ever does, when these multiple abuses of office come before Roberts and his colleagues and when, after that, the president ignores a Supreme Court ruling that goes against him. Until then, I guess, we take what we can get. You will notice that nowhere in this post do I use the word institutionalist. Fool me once, chief...",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Just Shredded His Own Credibility",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Chuck Schumer is done like dinner. His announcement on Thursday that he is surrendering to the House’s stopgap vivisection of what vital programs still have survived this administration’s bloodletting shreds what’s left of his credibility as a leader in the Senate and as a national leader in the Democratic party. It doesn’t matter whether he can muster enough votes to stay minority leader—and given what he did on Thursday, he’s likely to be the leader of a Democratic Senate minority for a long time—it no longer matters. As the months go on, and as the president and his ketamine-fueled button man continue their assault on the federal government, now with the complicity of both houses of Congress, Schumer is going to look increasingly silly and irrelevant. Absent an outright mutiny on the Senate floor, that complicity will gain his party ... nothing.\n\nSchumer certainly orchestrated his surrender well—a speech to the Senate, a press conference, and an op-ed in The New York Times. He never can say he wasn’t allowed to make his case. From Politico:\n\nHis points were two-fold: First, a shutdown would play into Trump and Musk’s hands, he argued, allowing them to continue with their slash-and-burn campaign overdrive. His second argument was more political—and in keeping with his long history as a leading strategist counseling his party to pay heed to the concerns of America’s middle class above all else. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift,” Schumer said. “It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\n\n“Right now, Donald Trump owns the chaos in the government. He owns the chaos in the stock market,” he added. “In a shutdown, we would be busy fighting with Republicans over which agencies to reopen, which to keep closed, instead of debating the damage Donald Trump’s agenda is causing the American people.”\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to point out that, for all practical purposes, the administration is shutting down the government anyway, and that by walking away from the fight and giving away what little leverage he has, Schumer has foreclosed any real political opportunity that might have presented itself by making the president “own” the chaos in government. Quite simply, Schumer now “owns” a part of the chaos going forward. The only question is how many Democrats want to partner with him in this new acquisition.\n\nA substantial portion of the Democratic caucus in the House feels hosed. They unanimously lined up against the plan—unafraid of the perils that so spooked Schumer about a shutdown. I think the Democratic members of the House recognized the obvious—that there is no palpable political advantage to be gained in helping the current administration. And if the most recent Quinnipiac poll is to be believed, 53 percent of respondents already blamed the Republicans for any shutdown before Schumer hit the silk. This is because those people looked at what the Republicans already were doing.\n\nMoreover, Schumer’s unilateral surrender completely ignores the fact that the administration is being rendered into sticks and splinters every time it finds itself in front of a federal court. Most recently, we had federal district judge William Alsup’s almost unprecedented ass-kicking in which he angrily ruled that thousands of laid-off federal workers be offered their old jobs back forthwith. From Politico:\n\nAlsup issued his ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions. He lashed out at the Justice Department over its handling of the case, saying he believes that Trump administration lawyers were hiding the facts about who directed the mass firings. “You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross examination would reveal the truth,” the judge said to a DOJ attorney during a hearing Thursday. “I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth. … I’m tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. ... It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” Alsup said.\n\nAnother federal district judge, this one in Maryland, ruled the same way on the same day. From The Washington Post:\n\n[James] Bredar, the judge, had signaled at a recent hearing he was likely to agree, noting to a Justice Department attorney that the case was not about whether the government can terminate people, but if those terminations were conducted legally. At one point, Bredar quoted the Silicon Valley mantra embraced by DOGE head Musk: “Move fast and break things.”\n\n\"Move fast? Fine,” Bredar said. “Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.”\n\nSchumer’s capitulation takes a lot of the political power out of how staunchly the federal courts have stood against the onslaught of the MAGA crew. Sooner or later, the administration is going to act in obvious contempt of court and, possibly, that will go up to the Supreme Court, which would have the opportunity to revisit its horrendous presidential-immunity decision from last July. This is only one of the righteous fights on which Chuck Schumer now has taken a pass. It’s time for someone to buy him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and shuffle him off the stage. He is not a wartime consigliere.\n\nRelated Story EPA Chief Lee Zeldin Is on a Mission to Let the Polluters Pollute\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Shall We See How the President’s Brilliant Trade War Strategies Are Affecting the Folks?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where they sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss bank.\n\nLet’s take a brief look around the country to see how the president’s brilliant trade-war strategies are affecting the Folks. From CNBC:\n\nCaleb Ragland, a soybean farmer in Magnolia, Ky., voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Now, however, he has to navigate a tariff minefield at a time when the sector is already facing major headwinds. … As pressures mount in the industry as a result of tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration—as well as retaliatory levies from other countries—he’s worried about the longevity of his business. “My sons potentially could be the 10th generation if they’re able to farm,” Ragland, who is also the president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC. “And when you have policies that are completely out of our control—that they manipulate our prices 20%, 30%, and on the flip side, our costs go up–we won’t be able to stay in business.” This isn’t the first time farmers have had to deal with new tariffs. Back in Trump’s first term, the trade war with China in 2018—a time when Ragland said the agricultural economy was “in a much better place than it is right now”—cost the U.S. agriculture industry more than $27 billion, and soybeans made up virtually 71% of annualized losses.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Ragland works in an market that got brained by the president’s trade policies in 2018, the last time the president was in office. And yet he voted for him twice since then. I have given up trying to understand this way of thinking. If you can’t rely on simple self-interest as an explanation for voting patterns, then political science might as well be alchemy or necromancy.\n\nIf the trade war has a front line, it probably runs through places like Point Roberts in Washington State. From Global News:\n\nPoint Roberts is a community of about 1,100 people and it is located just south of Tsawwassen. However, it relies on British Columbia for much of its commerce. “Half of us here are dual citizens, including me—Canadian and American, half of us,” Point Roberts resident Brian Calder and former president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce told Global News. “So there’s 500 of us here that have very strong ties to Canada. And I get that they’re upset and angry that their sovereignty is being threatened for no good reason whatsoever. And the animosity and the apprehension, the anger is very, very detrimental to Point Roberts. They stay away.”\n\n“It’s absolutely devastating for Point Roberts businesses, those that are left because we lost half our businesses in the COVID 20 months lockdown, they couldn’t carry themselves through that long period of time,” Calder said. “And of those left, now, they’re just barely hanging on.”\n\nNone of this, of course, is necessary. It is all so much gratuitous negligence. This is the first international conflict playing out completely in the deteriorating mind of an American president. Which doesn’t mean there are no casualties.\n\nCalder said Point Roberts residents consider British Columbians and Canadians brothers and sisters, not just neighbors. “We didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we in this mess? It’s absolutely stupid and it’s not productive and it’s not necessary or needed. And no one wins.” Calder said tensions are high on both sides of the border but some residents have expressed that they are facing hostility when they cross into Canada, which is part of the reason for the bumper sticker. \"We’ve had people actually try and push people over in traffic,” he said. “We’ve had people confronted down at the drug store in Tsawwassen. ‘What are you doing here? Get back to your own (country)’. We don’t have a drug store.”\n\nWe move along to Utah, which was a pioneer in adopting mail-in voting and which remained a reliably conservative state anyway. Now, however, out of what appears to be pure spite, the state legislature seems determined to blow up that proud history. From Bolts:\n\nLannie Chapman, the county clerk who runs this office and serves as the top elections official in Utah’s most populous county, eyed the artifact and considered how different, and difficult, her work would be if the state ever went back to voting the way it did when the old booth was in use. “No, thank you,” she said at the prospect, laughing. “It’s fun for a photo op, but that’s about it.”\n\nThe hypothetical may be a bit too close for comfort. A few miles up the road from Chapman’s Salt Lake City office, at the Utah State Capitol, lawmakers have just put the finishing touches on a major voting-system overhaul: House Bill 300, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature March 6, would end universal vote-by-mail in Utah. It’s a landmark reform that would close an era in which Utah occupied a unique place in the national patchwork of election rules: Since 2019, it’s been the only reliably red state in the country to automatically mail a ballot to every registered voter. HB 300 would instead require any Utah voter to proactively request a mail ballot. It would also impose additional restrictions on how they must return these ballots, for instance by ending the grace period for when they must be delivered to election offices by postal workers. “We are known for safe, secure, and convenient access, and this is going to make everything a lot more difficult,” Chapman said. “It’s not fair to our voters.”\n\nThis is simply conservative fanaticism run amok. Voting officials in Utah from both parties swear by the current vote-by-mail system, and the people seem to like it a great deal. But as Bolts learned, the people carrying the water for these changes are doing so for people far from the Beehive State.\n\nBolts put the question to state Representative Jefferson Burton, the Republican lawmaker who championed the bill. Burton conceded that the audit found no widespread fraud in Utah, and that vote-by-mail has increased turnout. But he cited an “Election Integrity Scorecard” by the Heritage Foundation, the influential national conservative think tank that published Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term. The scorecard ranks Utah 33rd among all states and the District of Columbia, docking Utah significantly for its policies on voter ID and absentee balloting. Burton said he expects that HB 300 will vault Utah into the list’s top 10, and made clear that he tailored his bill to that aim. “They [Heritage] think it should be a conscious decision for a voter to opt in to vote by mail,” he said. The lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action, has endorsed Burton’s bill.\n\nVivisecting a successful election system in Utah in order to gain brownie points with a right-wing intellectual chop shop in Washington is quite cultlike.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Cod-Soaker Friedman of the Algarve brings us a tale of bad chemistry. From News4 in Oklahoma City:\n\nLane Garrett and his family bought their land along the banks of the Cimarron River 16 years ago. “It’s real quiet out here,” Garrett said. “There’s lots of wildlife out here—turkey, quail, deer. There’s a river right over there.” The property sits at the very edge of Logan County, far from the noise and pollution of city life. “Very few people get to look out their kitchen window and see a river,” Garrett said.\n\nSounds idyllic. What could go wrong in paradise?\n\nThat’s why he and his family were frustrated when, in June 2024, they learned a pipeline would be running through their land. Phillips 66 went through the courts to condemn part of the family’s land, securing an easement to build the oil pipeline.\n\nOh, that could go wrong.\n\nConstruction began in January. “They bored underneath the river, and then it came up there on that north bank,” Garrett said. But with the work came a mess. “Just trash, you know, pop cans, chip cans,” Garrett said. “Cigarette butts, things like that.” Then, his brother, William, smelled something near the crew’s boring machine. “I was like, What? What is that? I know that smell, and I know it’s not good. What is that?” William Garrett said. “And then finally looked down and just a pool of hydraulic fluid.” Hydraulic fluid—and a lot of it—was seeping into their pasture. “I would say a good 20 feet to the north, you’d find it on the mud, little drops of where hydraulic fluid had just been sprayed in kind of a west-out direction,” Lane Garrett said.\n\nAfter first denying the whole thing, Phillips 66, the extraction beast that owned the pipeline, assured the Garretts that the hydraulic fluid had been cleaned up. They made a big show of doing so, even though the Garretts thought all the company was doing was “pushing dirt around.” When the cleanup was finally done, Garrett drilled a borehole into the area that allegedly had been cleaned. You can probably guess what they found.\n\n“You can see all that goopiness, all that hydraulic fluid,” William Garrett said. Sure enough, it was all still there—and thanks to recent rains—now heavily soaked into the groundwater all over their pasture, just yards away from the Cimarron River. Land—that the Garretts rely on. “I cut hay, bale hay, and then feed it, you know, to my neighbor’s cattle,” Lane Garrett said. It was supposed to be his family’s quiet paradise, away from the pollution.\n\n“It’s land that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into,” Lane Garrett said. But now, he says it’s land—he just can’t trust. “Now, rather than having chemicals just sitting on top of my pasture, now I’ve got a ball of chemicals, you know, five, six feet down underground in there, and that’s all going to kill everything above it,” Garrett said. “I just—I wanted all that stuff cleaned up. You know, I wish that, you know, the guys on the site, that they would have just been upfront, said, hey, look, there was an accident. This is what happened.”\n\nPipelines leak, and the companies that own them lie. That’s all ye know and all ye need to know.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

Exodus, 23:1–2\n\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

For the moment, however, let’s not ask for the moon here. It’s time to press hard on the grunts carrying those orders out. They’re all complicit in illegal acts. They’re all arguably involved in a conspiracy to obstruct justice because of their involvement in defying legitimate orders of the federal courts. Arrest the ICE agents. Arrest the guards. Hell, arrest the pilots who flew the prison planes to El Salvador; arrest whoever slapped the cuffs on Mahmoud Khalil and whoever it was who hustled him off into the night. Arrest enough of them and, maybe, there will be fewer people willing to hide beneath the smoke screens of the administration and its clownish legal teams, by which I definitely include the entire Department of Justice. Let them all argue that they were “just following orders,” but let them do it in court, in public, while wearing ankle irons. Maybe if we lock enough of them up, temporarily, we can instigate a wildcat job action in defense of our battered republic.\n\nDo I believe any of this is legal? I have no idea, but I’m operating on the administration’s own approach to law enforcement, which can be accurately defined as “What the hell, give it a try anyway.” That seems to be working pretty well for them. Let’s feed them their own oysters for a while.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, can we see if White House frontwoman Karoline-with-a-K Leavitt is one of those aliens from V who can unhinge her lower jaw and eat a live rat whole? The woman is the living embodiment of Hamlet’s conclusion that “one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.” On Monday, she was asked about the White House’s using an app meant to help migrants as an encouragement to self-deport, and she referred to how the White House disseminated a video of Salvadoran soldiers and police officers brutalizing the subjects of the administration’s human-trafficking program. This is what she said:\n\n“I would have to check in with the Department of Homeland Security, but it’s a great question,” Leavitt said when asked if any migrants have self-deported, “and we’re very proud to repurpose this app, which the Biden administration abused to facilitate the mass illegal entry of illegal immigrants into our country. It was like a fast pass at Disneyland. That’s not happening under this administration. We are encouraging illegal immigrants to actively self-deport to maybe save themselves from being in one of these fun videos.”\n\n“Fun videos.”\n\nSmile and smile...",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where Momma’s in the kitchen, and she ain’t got no shoes.\n\nIt was a target-rich environment out there this week, and we begin with the winner of this week’s FAFO Medal—Minnesota Republican state senator Justin Eichorn. He achieved some fame in wing-nut circles by proposing that the state’s legislature declare “Trump Derangement Syndrome” a legitimate form of mental illness. Chuffed by his newfound eminence among the goobers, Eichorn apparently decided to make a phone call. From the AP:\n\nGOP Sen. Justin Eichorn, 40, of Grand Rapids, was arrested in Bloomington on Monday in an undercover operation targeting commercial sex involving juveniles. Investigators had placed multiple ads online offering sex for money, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Court documents indicate Eichorn started sending messages in response to the ads March 11. “I saw your post and (sic) chance you are still available tonight?” one asked, according to an FBI affidavit, while a later message asked, “What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nEichorn exchanged messages with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl over several days, asking about pricing for various sex acts and requesting a picture, the affidavit said. They arranged a meet-up on Monday, where he arrived to find police ready to arrest him. Officers seized two cellphones, a condom, and $129 in cash, it said.\n\nPoor guy. Seems like all he wanted was to FA and all that happened was that he FO in a big way. What’s left for the guy? “FI” and “FUM,” I guess.\n\nWe move along to the Commonwealth (God save it!), where The Boston Globe’s Spotlight unit locked onto some serious police misconduct in the area of confidential informants in the city of New Bedford.\n\nWithin the department, Jorge Santos was a rising star. Barely 30, he was part of a specialized squad—the marine unit—tasked with overseeing a stretch of the city’s busy waterfront. Brash and aggressive, he won raves for his work ethic from supervisors, his impressive arrest totals recounted in the local media. In policing’s vernacular, he was a worker, the kind of hard-charging officer who delivered the stats that made bosses look good.\n\nAmong many in the department’s rank-and-file, however, Santos had a far different reputation. He’d long been known as a loose cannon, a reckless officer who cut corners and maybe more. A colleague in the marine unit had warned police higher-ups that Santos was a liability. Officer Mark Raposo told supervisors he would no longer back up Santos on calls because he didn’t want to put himself in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a bizarre scene aboard a fishing boat in which a New Bedford police officer, responding to a disturbance call on the boat, found himself in the middle of a scrum involving the boat’s crew and another member of the New Bedford PD.\n\nNow, Raposo was getting radioed by dispatch and ordered to sort out what exactly was happening aboard the Little Tootie.\n\nScreaming. Fighting. Shouts about drugs and money. And in the middle of the scrum stood his colleague, Santos, mumbling about a “confidential informant.”\n\nRaposo stood there, befuddled. What was his colleague—off-duty, armed, alone, and without a warrant or any paperwork—doing here in the middle of the night, tussling with some out-of-town fishermen? This wasn’t some clandestine police operation, Raposo thought. It was a robbery, a “drug rip,” in Raposo’s words. The perpetrator was a fellow cop. And the supposed confidential informant behind it? Probably a fabrication, Raposo figured.\n\nOh, lovely. Overuse of confidential informants has resulted in serious abuse of the concept of confidential informants. (According to Spotlight’s examination of what records they could squeeze out of the state’s various police departments, nine out of every ten drug busts in the Commonwealth—God save it!—depended vitally on the use of CIs. The other installments in the Spotlight series describe how the rise of New Bedford’s current police chief was fueled by his making busts based on what he said was information from CIs, and an account by a former CI about his terrifying life in Kafkaland in a Massachusetts prison.\n\n“ ‘Confidential informant’ is really a misnomer, because they’re not providing just confidential information,” said Lance Block, a Florida-based attorney who has helped craft legislation aimed at establishing protections for informants. “I call them ‘civilian operatives’ ... because they’re doing what police officers do.” He questions the whole premise. “We don’t use civilians to direct traffic at a football game, and yet we’re going to use civilians to go undercover and potentially put their life at risk?” he adds. “It just makes no sense.”\n\nWe hop on our pirogue and choogle on down to LOO-si-yana where Governor Greg Landry is letting his bon temps rouler in the state’s death chambers. From Bolts:\n\n\n\nSince taking office as governor in January 2024, Landry has signed a flurry of bills functionally abolishing parole going forward, granting police greater immunity, and moving all 17-year-olds into the adult criminal system, even those accused of minor crimes. But the symbolic heart of Landry’s “tough on crime” agenda has been his drive to resume state-sponsored killings. In 2018, Landry had criticized then-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, for not doing enough to jumpstart executions. Once governor, he did not mince words: “Capital punishment is lawful, and we intend to fulfill our legal duty to resume it,” he told legislators at the start of a special legislative session on crime that he called as one of his first official acts as governor.\n\nThe session was a blitzkrieg: Over the nine days it met, the Republican-controlled legislature reauthorized execution by electrocution and legalized nitrogen hypoxia. It also passed a “secrecy statute” that shields execution procedures from scrutiny, rendering them easier to carry out and harder to challenge. In February, Landry announced that the state had formalized a protocol for nitrogen killings. Three executions were quickly scheduled back to back in March. Then, nearly as quickly, one was taken off the calendar after it became clear that the prisoner in question hadn’t exhausted his appeals. Another execution scheduled for this month didn’t happen after the 81-year-old who was slated to be killed died of natural causes.\n\nThe piece centers on one death-row inmate named Chris Duncan and alleges that he may have been framed by a couple doctors who claimed to specialize in “forensic odontology”—i.e., bite marks—but whose work had been steadily discredited by other specialists in that field. (A video emerged that seemed to show one of these doctors using a mold of Duncan’s teeth to inflict the bite marks on the corpse of the victim, a young girl.) This occurred as bite-mark evidence itself was losing its credibility in court.\n\nIt wasn’t just Hayne and West, though: Bite mark analysis itself was being debunked. As of last year, [Journalist Radley] Balko told me, “every single scientific body to evaluate the merit of bite mark analysis has said there’s no scientific merit to it whatsoever.” During a 2012 deposition, even West changed his tune, saying, “I no longer believe in bite mark analysis. I don’t think it should be used in court,” though he would later continue to defend the practice in media interviews. Today, it routinely gets dismissed as junk science. “This bite mark stuff—it’s, I think the legal term is total bullshit,” Stafford Smith said.\n\nDuncan’s effort to secure a new trial is still hanging fire. All that’s changed is that Landry is now governor and he’s dedicated himself to limiting the appeals process that kept Duncan alive long enough to expose the two forensic “experts” as quacks. Bad enough that so many politicians are so determined to kill people, but there’s no reason to be quite so gleeful about it.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Outdoor Café Specialist Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of a state legislature grown exhausted by an excess of democracy. From Tulsa Public Radio:\n\nSenate Bill 1027 would limit the number of initiative petition signatures that could come from high-population areas and would require anyone collecting signatures to be an Oklahoma registered voter. The measure is headed to the state House after the full Senate approved it on Tuesday with a party-line vote of 36-8. The bill would require that no more than 10% of signatures on an initiative petition could come from a county where 400,000 or more people reside. That would affect only residents of Tulsa and Oklahoma counties by capping the total share of signatures from those two counties at 20%.\n\nNaturally, you don’t want signatures collected where the most people live because math is hard. That those two counties happen to be the state’s most heavily Democratic ones is purely coincidental, I am sure.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Yes, folks. He’s nutty as the Christmas fruitcake. From The New York Times:\n\nInstead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News. He has repeated the idea in other interviews on the channel.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your latest dispatch from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd he’s not alone.\n\nMr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion. “There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.\n\nImmunologists are aghast.\n\n“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.\n\nShe has a gift for understatement.\n\nSince January 2022, there have been more than 1,600 outbreaks reported on farms and backyard flocks, occurring in every state. More than 166 million birds have been affected. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus, called H5N1, to evolve into a more virulent form. Geneticists have been tracking its mutations closely; so far, the virus has not developed the ability to spread among people. But if H5N1 were to be allowed to run through a flock of five million birds, “that’s literally five million chances for that virus to replicate or to mutate,” Dr. Hansen said.\n\nEvidently, Mr. Secretary thinks that he’s Walter Reed in Cuba, except using chickens and not human volunteers. The super-immune chickens will Tell Us Something.\n\nMr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said. “The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.” Public health regulations would forbid the very few birds that might survive an infection from being sold. In any event, those birds might only be protected against the current version of H5N1, not others that emerge as the virus continues to evolve. “The biology and the immunology doesn’t work that way,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with how we factory-raise our food, especially the animate foodstuffs. But it can only be solved through vigorous government regulation—which, as we know, gives President Musk the vapors, so much so that he's already screwed the pooch on this very thing, forcing the Department of Agriculture to bail out both him and the president he theoretically serves. So, for the moment, there ain't nobody here but us chickens.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Goddamn, even this? From NPR:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms, and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump’s executive order on gender identity.\n\nSeveral federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes. A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, “FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26—Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.”\n\n“Equal Opportunity will not be considered...”\n\nGive my regards to 1954 and remember me to Orval Faubus. And the eye of Sauron descends on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, eventually, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nTo be clear, all businesses—those that have government contracts and those that do not—still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.\n\nFor now.\n\nOn this issue, especially, I do not want to hear anything from the anti-Trump Republicans. Almost from the time Lyndon Johnson handed Dr. King the pen with which h’d signed the CRA in 1964, the Republican Party determined to derive political benefits from attaching itself to the angry remnants of American apartheid. Almost to a person, our new allies made their careers within that context and, as best as I can recall, none of them raised a moral or political objection to the largely successful rollback of the achievements of the civil-rights movement. That is the singular moral failure at the heart of modern American conservatism.\n\n(LBJ saw it coming. And what he said to Bill Moyers is the gentler American equivalent of what Michael Collins said after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921: “I have signed my own death warrant.” They were both right.)\n\nElsewhere in the backward march of history, remember the great story of the Navajo Code Talkers, the Native soldiers who used their tribal language as an unbreakable code during World War II in the Pacific? (Made a pretty good movie, too, with Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach.) Well, apparently, it’s time to forget them again. From the Military Times:\n\nMany links that previously took viewers to informational articles about the Native American service members who used their native language as an indecipherable code to help win World War I and II were no longer accessible as of Tuesday afternoon. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department was working to rectify the situation.\n\nShut up. You got caught.\n\n“The department is restoring content about the Navajo Code Talkers,” the spokesperson said. “It had previously been removed during the auto-removal process.”\n\nSomebody had to program the auto-removal process, which means a decision was made to delete the Navajo material, probably along with the records of minority Medal of Honor winners. And we all have to admit now that LBJ pretty much low-balled that prediction.\n\n",

From The Guardian:\n\nIn a statement on social media, Alexandria police announced that at about 9.18am on Saturday, police responded to the 900 block of Beverley Drive following reports of an unresponsive woman. Upon arriving at the scene, authorities located a deceased woman who they later identified as 43-year-old Jessica Aber. “In a matter of protocol, an investigation is under way surrounding the circumstances of her death. The office of the chief medical examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death,” police said, without providing additional details surrounding her death.\n\nAs is—or was, anyway—the case with U.S. attorneys, Ms. Aber, who resigned on the day of Trump’s inauguration, prosecuted a wide variety of dangerous criminals.\n\nAber began her career in 2009 at the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia where she prosecuted financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime, and child exploitation cases. From 2015 to 2016, she served on an assignment as counsel to the assistant attorney general from the justice department’s criminal division. From 2016 until becoming US attorney, Aber served as the deputy chief of the criminal division for the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the US attorney’s office said.\n\nThese miscreants included a rogues’ gallery of characters, some of whom had the requisite motivation and the (theoretical) wherewithal to revenge themselves against the prosecutor(s) who put them away. From USA Today:\n\nThis is a target-rich environment for exploitative yahoos from across the political spectrum. Remember Seth Rich and ignore them all.

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Our friends, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists, have taken their act to sea these days, tracking some serious Russian maritime mischief in and around the Mediterranean—specifically, running guns to Libya and ferrying various types of contraband to various other places on ships of dubious provenance.\n\nThe documents show how commercial vessels—known as a ghost fleet—employed a range of tricks to avoid detection as they shipped Russian equipment to Libya. They also highlight growing European concerns about Russia’s influence in the country, which officials believed was part of a broader strategy by Moscow to project power in the Mediterranean and several African countries.\n\nAfter Isik posted the photographs, Interpol prepared a report on the Barbaros that found the vessel had manipulated its Automatic Identification System (AIS), the device that transmits information about a ship’s location, in an attempt to conceal its position. The report also found the ship had changed its name three times and had registered itself under the flag of a different country at least 10 times since 2013. The report assessed that the ship “may be carrying firearms destined for Libya” and recommended that authorities closely monitor it.\n\nThree name changes? Ten different flags? There are protected witnesses with less complicated CVs.\n\nRussia’s ghost fleet has enriched Moscow by helping it evade Western sanctions on its oil sales, according to the United States and European Union. Whether carrying oil or arms, these vessels often manipulate their AIS to avoid detection. In dozens of reports produced in 2024, European authorities tracked how vessels turned off their AIS when passing near the Syrian port of Tartus, where Russia maintains a naval base. Sometimes, these ships also spoofed their AIS data to appear in a different place than where they actually were. In another case, according to a report included in the leaked documents, a vessel suspected of shipping arms from Syria to Libya manipulated its location to appear offshore the Lebanese capital of Beirut—but mistakenly transmitted its location as on dry land at the airport, rather than the maritime port.\n\nThe Russians were a lot less clever when they were a bunch of broke Communists.\n\nTheir economy is a den of thieves. Their military is in shambles. They are ruled by a strongman who doesn’t even pretend to be anything but a kleptocrat any more and who seems perpetually to be one step ahead of a panicked flight to Bimini. Yet, despite all that, they still have the wherewithal to run an operation like this, and to sublet an American administration ... twice.\n\nAccording to a leaked briefing document, the head of the EU naval mission was advised in June that the number of Russian flights to Libya in the first half of 2024 matched the total for all of 2023, and that the mission had observed “a formalization of the Russian presence” over the past year. The document also described an increase of Russian military shipments to the country. “A Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean is a fact and we see regular navy visits to [Libya],” the briefing document stated. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company that had been operating in Libya since at least 2018, were supplanted in 2024 by the Africa Corps, a unit under the direct control of Russia’s military, the leaked documents reported.\n\nThe Africa Corps. Tobruk. This all seems familiar somehow.\n\nLibya represents “an immediate security issue for Europe” because of Russia’s presence there and the African nation’s role as a migration route, according to the internal summary following the meeting with the German envoy. “It’s a testament to Western strategic negligence,” said El Gomati, the Sadeq Institute director. “Russia has been constructing a military node that is not only capable of destabilizing Libya but also threatens European security 400 miles from NATO’s shores.”\n\nNegligence is doing a lot of work at having a kind meaning in that sentence.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

Here’s how we test products and why you should trust us.\n\n(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nBy now, a number of people have shared the video of Rep. Bill Keating’s standing up for Rep. Sarah McBride against her being deliberately misgendered by dumbass Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas). In fact, Keating’s righteous blast at Self was so loud that it almost obscured McBride’s neat little thrust of the shiv when she responded to Self as “Madam Chair.” Sweet.\n\nAnyway, up here, Keating’s response to Self’s nasty introduction of McBride came as something of a surprise. In a congressional delegation containing a number of high-profile members, Bill Keating is something of a backbencher, even though he’s been in Congress since 2011, representing a district that includes Cape Cod and the south coast of Massachusetts. He’s always been a stalwart on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ communities. But the iron in his spine that he demonstrated in Congress the other day comes as no surprise to those of us who remember his noble but failed attempt to overthrow William Bulger as president of the state senate in 1994. This roughly coincided with Bulger’s serial-killer brother Whitey’s decision to go on the lam for 16 years. Still, not many people crossed either Bulger and walked away. Keith Self was no problem at all.\n\nOn Thursday, my friend John Feinstein passed away unexpectedly at the age of 69. During my days as a daily sports columnist—and, before that, as a daily sports reporter specializing in college basketball in the winter and tennis in the summer—John was a fairly consistent presence in my life in the traveling sportswriting circus that follows the major events of the calendar. A Final Four or a US Open in Flushing Meadows without John was unthinkable—though I have to admit that two weeks at the Open with John’s constant (and bad) imitation of Ivan Lendl could be a trial. In 1986, of course, he published , an account of a year spent with Bob Knight’s Indiana Hoosiers that, through the dint of his dogged reporting, was the first look into the fact that IU’s basketball team was being run by a sociopath (although, ultimately, the book pulled that punch). No matter, the book has now sold over 8 million copies, and it broke the best-seller lists for sports books of all kinds. After that, John turned out one book after another, like clockwork, every spring. There were two giants of Father’s Day book sales. One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was John Feinstein.\n\nHe could be impossible. He was as dogmatic as anyone I ever met. He knew what he knew, and he thought he knew what you knew, and he would not be shaken in either belief. He had his favorites, and he was also unshakable in his support of them. (The most heated argument we ever had was over his support of the late Jim Valvano, whom John adored despite his disdain for most coaches who bent the rules as badly as Valvano did.) But dammit, he also had a heart as big as the Ritz, and that made all the difference, and how can you not love a guy who responded to Knight’s calling him both a “whore” and a “pimp” by saying he wished Knight would make up his mind so he’d know how to dress?\n\nThe great Dave McKenna has written a proper obituary over at Defector. We ran in different circles the past few years, and we’d fallen out of touch. Apparently, his last few years had been tinged with more than a little melancholy. I will miss knowing that he’s out there in the world, which is a much quieter place these days, and there are too many empty chairs at the table. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Stomp Off, Let’s Go” (Fat Babies): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1955, is the arrival of Barbara Porritt, the millionth migrant to land in Australia. She shares the video with a Dutch family of 16. Considering how many “migrants” arrived in Australia against their will, the sunniness of this arrival is a nice historical antidote. History is so cool.\n\nIn advance of Himself’s Day on Monday, Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, stopped by the White House this week and got a good close-up look at what we’ve done to ourselves nowadays. He was greeted by a presidential “episode” that must have made him wonder if all those decades of emigration had been worth it after all. From the AP:\n\nAsked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country’s tax policies. “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,” Trump said.\n\nMartin affected the look of a man who suddenly had found himself involved in a carny sideshow as the president went a-wandering in his mind.\n\nAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S. “By the way, I love these socks. What’s with these socks? I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks,” Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room. Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin’s visit. When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let [Rosie] O’Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening. “I like that question,” the president said, adding that Martin was “better off not knowing” about O’Donnell.\n\n(The “reporter” who lobbed this hunk of insane banality into the dialogue was Brian Glenn of the Real America’s Voice, a wing-nut marionette who was the guy who criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit when he met with the president and who also is famously the current main squeeze of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Here’s Tiger Beat on the Potomac taking Glenn’s bullshit seriously.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nThe Donggung palace complex in present-day South Korea was once an elaborate lakeside retreat with at least 26 buildings used for hosting festivals and banquets. Now, archaeologists have also discovered several innovative “flush” toilets at the 1,300-year-old site, including one that likely drained into a nearby waterway. During recent excavations at the complex, researchers found a small two-room building with a hole in the middle of a cut granite slab, according to a statement from the Korean Heritage Service. On either side of the hole, they found wide stepping stones.\n\nExperts think waste from the toilet funneled into an underground holding chamber, similar to those used in outhouses or portable toilets. A servant likely poured water into the hole to flush the waste down a drain and into the chamber. Inside the palace, researchers also found a flush toilet that “directly discharges human waste into the river through a drain,” Kim Gyeong Yeol, an archaeologist with the Korean Heritage Service who led the recent excavations, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus. The interior toilet was probably reserved for use by the crown prince and his court ladies.\n\nI would point out that this is pretty much the same system to which the Supreme Court gave its blessing not that long ago. Plus ça change, plus ça ick.\n\nHey ABC News, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nThe large rock was excavated from the Callide Basin in central Queensland and gifted to the Moura State High School, where it sat unnoticed for two decades, according to the University of Queensland. When paleontologists were asked by the school to examine a cluster of three-toed track marks on the boulder, they found it contains one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, according to a paper published Monday in Historical Biology.\n\nThe rock contains 66 footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs, Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The footprints were likely imprinted onto the boulder as the dinosaurs passed across a patch of wet, white clay, possibly walking along or crossing a waterway during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, Romilio said. “It’s an unprecedented snapshot of dinosaur abundance, movement and behavior from a time when no fossilized dinosaur bones have been found in Australia,” Romilio said.\n\nIn addition to being the name of my next prog-rock band, Dinosaur Abundance appeals to me as a concept. Maybe they were all having a dance back in the day. In any case, they gathered then to make us happy now.\n\n\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

From The New York Times:\n\nAnother official said the briefing would be China focused, without providing additional details. A fourth official confirmed Mr. Musk was to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but offered no details. Hours after news of the planned meeting was published by The New York Times. Pentagon officials and President Trump denied that the session would be about military plans involving China. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night social media post. It was not clear if the briefing for Mr. Musk would go ahead as originally planned. But providing Mr. Musk access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded military secrets would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to Mr. Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose.\n\nSomehow, I am rarely reassured by what is said by the president in “late-night social media” posts. Neither am I reassured by the fact that the Pentagon is currently run by a former Jägermeister spokesmodel.\n\nPentagon war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are among the military’s most closely guarded secrets. If a foreign country were to learn how the United States planned to fight a war against them, it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less likely to succeed. The top-secret briefing that exists for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict. It covers the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period, that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions, according to officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nLastly, I am not reassured by the fact that, if it ever came to guns with China, this guy’s creations would be fighting for both sides, and not just because whatever it is he manufactured is even money to glitch itself into the Mariana Trench shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nLosing Democracy by the Dose—A Novel.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Vice President J Divan Vance continues to make friends and influence nobody on the world stage. This time, the topic was the president’s lunatic dream of seizing Greenland from Denmark. (But not, curiously, making it a state, which, according to the president’s other lunatic dream, is his plan for Canada.) Because he is a good boy who deserves favor, Vance explained that the time has come once again for us to exercise the Divine Right of Lunatics. From The Independent:\n\nAsked whether he believed the U.S. could acquire Greenland during an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in February, Vance said: “I think it’s possible, Maria. Here’s the thing which I think a lot of folks don’t appreciate about Greenland. It’s really important to our national security,” the vice president claimed. Vance explained that there are “sea lanes” surrounding Greenland, used by the Chinese and the Russians. The former Ohio senator accused the Danish government of restricting U.S. access and, therefore, “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.”\n\nThank you, Yale dude. I never noticed that Greenland was an island and, therefore, surrounded by sea lanes. And considering that the current president—and, therefore, his good boy VP—never shuts up about seizing the place, I’d restrict our access to it as well.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview, which discussed several of Trump’s measures, Vance suggested that the only real solution to the national security issue was to take “more territorial interest in Greenland.” He stressed that Trump would take the island if necessary, saying, “That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn’t care about what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first.”\n\nSorry, Yale dude. I lived through the decades in which what was once the Soviet Union was a serious military threat to the U.S., albeit occasionally an overhyped one, and not a dead-broke kleptocracy. And in those days, we were content with the DEW line and all the other safeguards stationed in and around the Arctic. I do not wake in the night terrified about Russian fishing trawlers. And I don’t think I want to take up in a country dedicated to the geopolitics of the Reverend G.I. Grabitall.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the first commando raid of the takeover has been launched. It was led by the White House national security advisor, a hack named Mike Waltz, and Usha Vance, wife to J Divan. Their arrival was not greeted with a Laurel and Hardy handshake. From The Guardian:\n\nGreenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”. Mike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. Trump has pledged to make the autonomous territory—part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy—part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate. “Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” He added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nAs it happens, Egede’s party lost the last election. The winners are trying to build a coalition government right now, and the one thing they don’t need is a state visit from representatives of a country threatening a hostile takeover of the whole island. I don’t believe it’s coincidental. They’re looking at Greenland like it’s an exercise in vulture capitalism. Striking. Hot irons. That kind of thing.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "They’ve done everything except hang a sign at every port of entry reading, CLOSED: UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. From The Washington Post:\n\nCanadians are skipping trips to Disney World and music festivals. Europeans are eschewing U.S. national parks, and Chinese travelers are vacationing in Australia instead. International travel to the United States is expected to slide by 5 percent this year, contributing to a $64 billion shortfall for the travel industry, according to Tourism Economics. The research firm had originally forecast a 9 percent increase in foreign travel, but revised its estimate late last month to reflect “polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric.”\n\nThis moment isn’t without precedent. Sacks notes that international tourism slowed sharply during the first Trump presidency, amounting to roughly $20 billion in unrealized revenue, even before covid-related disruptions. Back then, it was tourists from Mexico, China and the Middle East who were pulling back, deterred by the administration’s travel bans, tariffs and tough talk on immigration. This time, Canada—the top source of international travel to the United States—is poised to lead the way. Trump has for weeks said he wants to make the country a “51st state.” In response, Canada’s former prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged Canadians not to vacation in the United States.\n\nPeople don’t want to come here any more. Come April, here in Boston, the administration may have a worse effect on international participation in the Boston Marathon than the pandemic did. In three years, Los Angeles is due to host the Olympics and the Paralympics, and it’s hard to imagine we’ll have regained the trust of the world by then.\n\nAnd then there are all the other reasons people have to come to this country that, in its previous generosity, it shared with the world. No more Japanese people on the Freedom Trail up here. No more Brits visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia to show they don’t hold any grudges. No more Brazilians, or Costa Ricans, or, God help us, Venezuelans staring awestruck into the Grand Canyon. And, what the hell, the government doesn’t care about national parks anymore anyway.\n\nBertha Lopez, who is from Mexico and lives near Toronto, used to cross the U.S. border every few weeks to buy staples like butter and cheese. This year, she’s stopped all of that — and vows not to set foot in the United States for at least a few years. She recently canceled a trip to Arizona to visit a longtime friend whose husband is ill; instead, she’s buying her friend a ticket to visit her in Canada this summer. “All of this talk of making Canada the 51st state has been upsetting. It’s just incredibly offensive,” the 54-year-old said. “So I’m doing what I can: No more Tide. No more Coca-Cola. No more Disney. And barring a funeral or someone in the hospital, I am not going to the United States.”\n\nForgive us, world, for we knew damn well what we were doing.",

But let us take a look at how the charm offensive was going this weekend.\n\nOur own Logan Airport apparently has been turned into an immigration black site, complete with enhanced interrogation. Dozens of stories have emerged of the human costs on the ongoing DOGE and Pony Show—graduate schools rescinding acceptances because federal funding for programs has been cut, Social Security recipients being denied benefits because somebody somewhere declared them dead, pediatric brain-cancer patients being abandoned mid-treatment, court orders now being routinely ignored to the point where tin-pot Central American presidents are mocking them. The president is now threatening to ignore the lawful pardons granted by former president Biden, basing this latest power grab on a theory even more laughable than the one he used to justify his reverse human trafficking to El Salvador. Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army scrubs its website records of Black and Hispanic and other minority military members, including the 442nd Infantry, the famous Nisei unit in World War II that was recruited from Japanese Americans out of the detention camps where they were being held. He’s demanding that Columbia University knuckle under even more than it already has and has said quite plainly that Columbia is merely the lab rat for a genuine assault on the country’s colleges and universities.

The white dress featured a sleeveless draped top with an open back, asymmetrical waistline, and a full ankle-length skirt festooned with tufts of black hair. While the look was divine on its own, Watts looked even better in the company of her matching canine co-star, Bing, who posed alongside her on the red carpet.\n\nWatts let the outré dress do most of the talking, finishing her look with a pair of white pointy-toe slingbacks.

        "content": "Miguel Castro Freitas is to succeed Casey Cadwallader as creative director of Mugler, parent company L’Oréal announced today.\n\n“Miguel lives and breathes the Mugler spirit. His deep understanding of Mugler’s DNA and his vast creativity and talent made him a natural choice,” said Danièle Lahana-Aidenbaum, global brand president of Mugler fashion & fragrances.\n\nA Portuguese national, Castro Freitas is unknown to the public and little known in the fashion industry. He graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2004, was handpicked by John Galliano to work at Dior after graduation and has held designer jobs at Yves Saint Laurent under Stefano Pilati and Lanvin alongside Alber Elbaz. Most notably, he has been head of tailoring at Christian Dior, led by Raf Simons, head of womenswear at Dries Van Noten and creative director of Sportmax from SS21 to SS24. He may not fall in the big-name designer category or have a presence on social media, but he has 20 years of experience working for established luxury houses.\n\n“It is an honour to join the spectacular house of Mugler. As one of the twentieth century’s great couturiers, Mr Mugler reimagined the power and limits of fashion. Alongside the teams, I am thrilled to bring my own vision, story and emotion to this monumental heritage,” said Castro Freitas.\n\nMugler was absent from the Paris Fashion Week calendar for Autumn/Winter 2025, which fuelled speculation regarding changes at its creative helm. This morning, in a separate statement the house said that Cadwallader would be stepping down at the end of March. “Over the last seven years, his unique vision has helped introduce Mugler to a new generation, all the while celebrating core themes of empowerment, inclusivity and identity. On behalf of the team, we wish Casey the utmost success in his next ventures,” Lahana-Aidenbaum said.",

        "content": "Actors Nicole Brydon Bloom and Justin Theroux first met in 2022, when their mutual friend, actor Louisa Jacobson, introduced them at a private party at the Lower Manhattan bar The Nines. “After the party, a group of us went to grab a drink nearby,” Nicole remembers. “It was an abnormally cold night in New York City—about six degrees—and Justin very kindly offered me his gloves, which I gratefully accepted and promptly returned once we were back inside.”\n\nThe next morning, Nicole got a surprise text from Justin that said: “This yours?” with a photo attached. “It was a picture of him holding my little criss-crossed diamond ring which I had worn, and sadly assumed I’d lost, the night before,” Nicole explains. “Turns out it had slipped off my cold finger into his large gloves when I returned them. Justin put his hands into the glove the next morning and the ring slid halfway onto his finger. He likes to joke that I proposed first, the very first night we met!”\n\n“I for sure thought leaving the ring in my glove was a move,” Justin jokes. “Which now, knowing Nicole as well as I do, it certainly was not. She has left more jewelry, jackets, and bags in places than I can count. So, definitely not a move.” Justin also remembers being smitten with Nicole within the first 10 minutes of talking to her—before even asking her name. “I pointed her out across the room to my friend Rassi and when he saw her he did a double take, turned to me and literally said, ‘She is the one,’” Justin remembers. “I had no way of knowing how prescient his comment would turn out to be. I then begged him to go over to collect her name, which like an idiot I had not gotten.”\n\nA year and a half after they started dating, Justin proposed during a vacation on the coast of Italy. It was raining and cloudy when they arrived at Hotel Il Pellicano on the coast of Monte Argentario, and they were very jet-lagged. “We almost skipped dinner but decided to take advantage of our first evening on the coast together and ended up having a really poignant conversation over a candlelit dinner,” Nicole recalls. “While eating, a radiant, full blue moon came out and left us both in awe. Justin suggested bringing our drinks down to the water. He popped back to the room, under the guise of getting us some towels, but was really collecting the ring. We were looking out at the water and the moon when he proposed. He said some of the most beautiful things. It was wonderful—we were both crying.”",

        "content": "A chunky lambskin leather jacket with hulking shoulder pads, a red and black resin necklace straight out of an ‘80s fantasy, a tiny white mini skirt with even tinier red polka dots, and a massive 1960s silver cuff with accents of carnelian and turquoise: this is a non-exhaustive list of things I bought last fall at Carrie Bradshop, the Carrie Bradshaw themed boutique in Lyon, France. On their own, they’re the kind of rare vintage oddities that easily shake up an everyday look. But together? Definitely, exactly like something Carrie Bradshaw would have worn, especially when Patricia Field was styling the character in the original Sex and the City series, which ran from 1998–2004.\n\nCourtesy of Carrie Bradshop\n\nOn a quiet street, Carrie Bradshop’s signature pink sign shines bright. Inside, disco balls hang, Y2K era displays line the floor, and huge Sex and the City posters dominate the walls. There’s a great selection of affordably priced, non-designer vintage items that look like they were plucked straight from Carrie Bradshaw’s closet: silk scarves, sunglasses, printed mini skirts, colorful tops, and little dresses. But accessories are one of the main attractions: designer handbags, statement jewelry and eccentric belts. Shop owners Yvo Deprelle and Patrick-Pierre Olinger stock anything and everything, as long as it’s true vintage, feminine, and looks like something Carrie would wear. (Though they also have a special place in their hearts for 1980’s Joan Collins era fashion from Dynasty.)\n\nUpstairs, there’s an entire section devoted to menswear–decorated with a huge poster of the infamous 2003 Yves Saint Laurent M7 fragrance campaign featuring a sensual shirtless male model. Imagine, not the kinds of things Mr. Big or Adrian would wear, but maybe how a Carrie superfan would dress.\n\nDeprelle and Olinger met in 2006 and immediately bonded over their love of Sex and the City and vintage fashion. They started doing pop-ups and vintage markets before opening up the shop in 2010. They each have their own eclectic backgrounds. Deprelle worked as a fashion editor between Lyon and Paris at titles including Marie Claire, Blush and Euronews while Olinger was raised by an antique dealer father who inspired him to search for vintage treasures all over the world. Deprelle also started vintage shopping at the age of 15, when he was a singer in a gothic band with an affinity for designer fashion. “With YSL the world is yours,” he says.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "We take it for granted, but salt is one of the most important minerals in the world. Throughout history, it’s played an integral role in human civilization—it’s been used for everything from currency to mystical rituals to the preservation of food. Trade routes have been created according to its availability; whole wars have been fought over its accessibility.\n\nNaturally, this all-important ingredient has been used for beauty rituals across the centuries, too. The ancient Greeks and Romans used seawater to heal various ailments, including ones that impacted the skin. Hippocrates—who is often referred to as the father of medicine—was also a true believer in the power of sea water, and created many studies related to the practice of thalassotherapy, which uses sea water as a treatment to relax the muscles, improve circulation, and detoxify the body. Not that you have to be Hippocrates to understand the benefits of salt water—anyone who has spent a leisurely afternoon swimming in the sea can probably attest to the benefits of sea salt for the skin easily.\n\nThe benefits of sea salt for skin\n\nAlthough consuming too much salt isn’t a great idea, incorporating a little sea salt into your skincare routine may have benefits indeed. Alongside sea salt’s power to exfoliate and hydrate the skin, its high concentration of minerals make it an incredibly nourishing skincare ingredient.\n\nDead Sea salt, which is rich in magnesium, seems to have particularly impressive benefits for the skin. “Bathing in a magnesium-rich Dead Sea salt solution improves skin barrier function, enhances skin hydration, and reduces inflammation in atopic dry skin,” found one clinical trial. “Magnesium salts are known to bind water, influence epidermal proliferation and differentiation, and enhance permeability barrier repair.”\n\nIndeed, “the Dead Sea boasts an unparalleled composition of 21 natural minerals, including magnesium, 15 times higher than any other sea,” notes Liat Gourary of the Tel Aviv-based skincare company Sabon, which draws much of the inspiration for its products from the nearby Dead Sea. “The mineral-rich waters and salts of the Dead Sea, used as gentle, natural exfoliants, revitalize the body, offering vitalizing and detoxifying micro-nutrients for healthy-looking, radiant skin.”\n\nBut minerals are not the only elements in Dead Sea salt that benefit the skin. “Dead Sea water has a unique ion composition and its benefits on skin health have been well-known since ancient times,” explains a recent scientific review. “Specifically, [these ions] can resist skin senescence [aging] from three different perspectives—keratinocyte rejuvenation promotion, photo-protection, and cellar energy elevation—which indicates their strong application potential in anti-aging cosmetics.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Not quite sure which finger, exactly, is the engagement ring finger? For a lot of people, it’s not top of mind—or top of hand—during the whole proposal process: after all, your loved one got on knee, pulled out a ring, and asked you to marry them. What exact digit the diamond ring goes on can feel like mere semantics amid the grand enormity of the moment.\n\nFor the soon-to-be or recently engaged, here’s everything you need to know about the engagement ring finger.\n\nWhat Is the Engagement Ring Finger?\n\nTraditionally, the engagement ring finger is the fourth finger on your left hand. Basically: it’s the finger next to your pinky.\n\nWhat Is The History Of The Engagement Ring Finger?\n\nThe ancient Romans believed that the left hand ring finger contained a “vena amoris”—or a distinct vein that went directly to the heart. (At the time, scientists had not yet discovered that all veins go to the heart, making this finger bloodline seem quite meaningful.) “The custom of placing the betrothal or wedding ring upon the fourth finger seems undoubtedly to owe its origin to the fancy that a special nerve, or vein, ran directly from this finger to the heart,” wrote George Frederick Kunz in his 1917 book Rings for the Finger. Indeed, references to the “vena amoris” or the “heart finger” can be found referenced in centuries-old texts throughout history: “That is called the heart finger, and hath (they say) a veine in it which reacheth to the heart, so to signifie the hearty, and constant love which ought to be betwixt man and wife,” wrote Henry Turberville in An Abridgement of Christian Doctrine published in 1648.\n\nThe “vena amoris” was both considered romantic and, well, medical: doctors in the Middle Ages would sometimes put leeches on the ring finger of patients in hopes of sucking out sickened blood.\n\nDo Engagement Rings Always Go On Your Left Hand?\n\nIn the United States and Western Europe, it is tradition to put it on your left hand ring finger. However, in some cultures like India and Russia, it is worn on the right hand as that side is considered to be lucky and auspicious.\n\nWhy Else Do We Wear Engagement Rings On The Left Hand Ring Finger?\n\nFor many brides or brides to be, wearing an engagement ring on the left hand ring finger is also a practical choice. The ring finger is the weakest on the hand. As a result, it does not move much throughout the day, unlike the active and dexterous thumb or pointer finger. Its stationary demeanor decreases the risk of damage to the ring, making it the safest place to put an expensive bauble.\n\nFurthermore, 90 percent of people are right handed—meaning they predominantly use their right hand for every day tasks. That again would increase wear and tear of an expensive bauble.\n\nWhat Finger Does Your Wedding Ring Go On?\n\nAmerican brides put their wedding ring on their left hand ring finger stacked under their engagement one.",

The best dressed stars of the week were those who slipped into colorful and lightweight silhouettes that are stylishly ready for warmer weather. This included everything from gauzy and sheer dresses, to sharp tailoring and suits.\n\nTake actor Danielle Brooks, who was spotted in L.A. wearing a semi-sheer, swishy Jean Paul Gaultier dress in a vibrant multicolor print. It’s the perfect spring dress that doesn’t require much styling—let an impactful frock do all the talking! Same goes for Lady Gaga and her fire-red McQueen gown, which hit all the right notes of dark romance. (Cue her song—Ga Ga, oh la la!).\n\nWhite Lotus star Leslie Bibb went for a more polished approach to spring dressing, wearing a three-piece Thom Browne suit while doing press in New York City. (A far cry from her character on the show, who favors slinky summer dresses.) Her White Lotus co-star Michelle Monaghan also looked chic in a Patou coat with an oversized collar. Sure, her choice to don a heavier coat may be clinging onto notes of winter dressing—but lest we not forget it is a transitional season, meaning you never know when a cooler day will require a jacket.

Just yesterday, she was seen in a classic checkered overcoat and straight-leg jeans—perfectly emitting that effortlessly-chic vibe of the French. And today, Jenner continued her style streak with yet another refined look.\n\nThis time, the star opted for an updated trench coat. The khaki-colored style featured a double-belted silhouette, both at the neckline and the waist. The finer details, like draped shoulders and widened sleeves, also made the coat feel elevated—as did her Hermès Kelly bag and satin pumps, which completed the look with further polish.\n\nJenner isn’t the only star to get on board with the modernized trench coat this season. Over the past few months, trendsetters such as Rihanna, Hailey Bieber, and Mikey Madison have all stepped out in updated styles—ranging from asymmetrical silhouettes, to all-over leather treatments. While a classic trench will never go out of style, there is something fresh about this new crop of coats: they instantly inject your wardrobe with cool sophistication. And as Jenner proves, a great statement coat does all the heavy lifting for your outfit—why wouldn’t you make it your next spring investment?",

        "content": "Last names are political; that much is obvious. From immigrants smoothing out those Old Country consonants (just ask Ralph Lifshitz, Mindy Chokalingam, and Ramón Estévez, better known as Ralph Lauren, Mindy Kaling, and Martin Sheen), to political figures trying to adopt a man-of-the-people persona (Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, a.k.a. Boris Johnson, springs to mind), there’s always a strategic aim behind this kind of rebranding. Even single-name female celebrities—Cher, Madonna, Oprah—who operate above the mortal realm might be telling us something about their attitude to the patriarchal tradition of taking on some man’s identity.\n\nIn her show With Love, Meghan, the former royal shares that she’s apparently now using the surname Sussex. Fair enough, I say. It’s a nice place. Good chalk cliffs, some nice vegetarian cafés. Honestly, what another woman chooses to call herself is not only none of my business, but also none of my interest.\n\nHowever, the assumption that a woman’s identity should be subsumed into that of either her father or male partner has always struck me as weird. Ever since I first read the name Princess Michael of Kent and, being 11, sniggered, I’ve found this practice at best absurd and at worst oppressive.\n\nWhich is why I have named my daughter Frizzell. Second time around, as I cycled across the city, nine months pregnant, to face a class of teenagers as their English teacher, I became increasingly resolved in my desire to pass on my own name. It is, after all, a great name. I didn’t actually know that my full name rhymed until I got to secondary school. When I confronted my parents about this rather Dr. Seuss-y moniker—so many Zs, so many Ls, so many ways to rhyme with “smell”—they claimed not to have noticed either.\n\nMy son has his father’s surname. This was a decision partly inspired by the fact that he shares a first name with my father, and so it seemed sensible to create a distinction, and also because I was happy to have Frizzell in there as a middle name, should he ever want to change. However, when I told my son that I was pregnant with a girl and wondering what to call her, he very quickly agreed that she should become a Frizzell. According to his logic, “Girls are Frizzells.” And who am I to argue?",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen people come in, right, with, they come in like this,\n\nI definitely feel like you're gonna get my whole lash\n\nand people have.\n\nAgain, look at the mouth open.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHourglass, baby!\n\nIt's translucent tan.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nAlso, I think I bought 57 of these,\n\n5711 of these from Costco.\n\nSecond to the last, Sakura.\n\nIt's so light, but like hmm,\n\nthat's a ranch [indistinct], like it's so good.\n\nThe last thing and this is my favorite,\n\nwell, one of my favorite products from my line,\n\nit's the Styling Glaze\n\nwhere I could have just done with my finger, but.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\nI hope you learned a little something more about me,\n\nthe products that I use.\n\nAnd I hope you have a great day.\n\nI will.",

        "content": "Drawing from her personal experience as a 22-year-old disabled woman who uses a wheelchair full-time, Paris-based designer Naya El Ahdab said she created a “collection for everyone.” Prioritizing both comfort and soft structure, she incorporated finely pleated jersey and stretch fabrics alongside boning and padding to enhance the body’s shape, as well as girdles, molded from her own medical corset. “My disability became my greatest strength,” she shared. “Confidence comes from embracing your body, not hiding it—self-acceptance has turned my vulnerability into art.”\n\nGerman accessory designer Mijoda Dajomi envisioned a near-future where, by 2085, water scarcity forces humanity to collect rainwater for survival. This not-so-unrealistic concept inspired Daughters of Water, a group of slightly intimidating dystopian guardians—somewhere between The Handmaid’s Tale and Dune—dedicated to protecting us against dehydration, elegantly outfitted in towering wax-cotton headgear designed to collect varying amounts of rainwater.\n\nPatrick Taylor Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS Gabrielle Szwarcenberg Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS\n\nNostalgia for a childhood spent skiing and sailing with his family inspired London-born, New York-based knitwear designer Patrick Taylor. His collection featured playful padded forms, crafted through neoprene silhouettes that evoked the feeling of a child outgrowing his beloved sports gear. Vibrant bursts of color added a fresh energy, while the shapes appeared windswept, as if contoured by the motion of a sailing trip or the rush of skiing down the slopes. A similar lighthearted approach was embraced by Gabrielle Szwarcenberg, a Belgian designer who since childhood has crafted hundreds of paper planes. She found a kindred spirit in Harry Smith, a Beatnik who, during the ’60s and ’70s, collected 250 paper planes of all sizes from the streets of New York. Translating this passion into actual outfits, she recreated their aerodynamic silhouettes in a collection of geometric garments, cut origami-style and treated to mimic the texture and structure of paper.\n\nA group of talented Chinese designers stood out for their ability to merge research and innovation with cultural heritage and personal memories. Zhuen Cai drew inspiration from a visit to Shanghai’s Yuyuan Garden, a place of poetic beauty that shaped his romantic collection. Blending elements of rural traditions, theatrical costumes, and artisanal techniques, he created elaborate outfits that felt both dreamy and contemporary. Fur, the ubiquitous presence in this season’s collections, was the focal point for designer Yifan Yu, who explored it as a symbol of the human connection to nature—particularly in the Northern tribes that wore it during pagan festivities. Seeking sustainable alternatives, he developed all-natural materials, cutting them into zoomorphic shapes integrated into protective menswear designs. Qianhan Liu’s collection was a tour de force of imaginative craftsmanship. While drawing inspiration from Eastern traditions, she explored the tactile potential of materials with remarkable skill—transforming leather into laser-cut leaves, hand-stitched onto knit crochet to form a sculptural cloak, or printing it to mimic wood bark, which she then shaped into oversized pantsuits and draped tunics. Accessory designer Cindy Zhaohan Li reimagined the everyday brush as a sensory tool, infusing it with both function and artistry. Her collection featured a series of ergonomic designs—some crafted as portable, handbag-like objects, others resembling flowing chevelures—enhancing tactility and giving the ordinary brush a playful, sensual dimension.\n\nZhuen Cai Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS Yifan Yu Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS\n\nQianhan Liu Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS Cindy Zhaohan Li Photo: Courtesy of Fondazione ITS\n\nThis year’s jury included, among others, Andrea Rosso, OTB and Diesel Sustainability Ambassador; designer Maria Sole Ferragamo; Sara Sozzani Maino, Fondazione Sozzani’s creative director; Stefano Gallici, Ann Demeulemeester creative director; Dame Zandra Rhodes; and philosopher Emanuele Coccia.",

        "content": "“You work on commission, right? Big mistake. Big! Huge!”\n\n35 years later, that iconic Pretty Woman scene is still talked about today. When Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) walks into an upscale store, to get her revenge on two snobby sales associates who had refused to work with her, we all collectively cheered. I still get chills when she saunters in wearing her polished buttoned dress, white gloves, and dramatic black brimmed chapeau; just a few days prior the L.A. prostitute had worn her more casual clothes—a slinky cut-out dress and thigh-high boots, a sweater tied around her waist—and was swiftly chased out the store. But now, in her snazzy new movie-makeover outfit, financed by her new wealthy businessman client Edward Lewis (Richard Grant), Vivian holds power. The film’s costume designer, Marilyn Vance, is to thank.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Everett Collection\n\nIn the three decades since the film came out, many Hollywood rom-coms have tried to replicate the magic of the Pretty Woman fashion transformation. When Vivian begins dressing more elegantly to fit into Edward’s world, we see her slowly start to receive the respect she deserves; clothes are used as a metaphor for her transformative character arch. “In each successive look, you begin to see her take his `less is more' direction,” Vance said in an interview. “By the end, she's very simply put together—pure sophistication.” The effective use of fashion to drive the story forward in such a way has been endlessly replicated by countless films since—including in 1999’s She’s All That, 2001’s The Princess Diaries, and 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada, among many others.",

[laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWelcome to Vanity Fair Oscar Party live. This is the hottest party of the year and the\n\none place where anything can happen. Hello everybody. I'm Tan France and I'm so excited to be back\n\nhere live at Vanity Fair's legendary Oscar bash, here in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe stars are pouring in to celebrate Hollywood's most iconic night as a designer. You know, I'm all about the fashion, and we\n\nalready have had the most amazing looks. There have been so many incredible ones. There's already, uh, Kelly Rowland on the red\n\ncarpet. Looks incredible. We've had Sarah Paulson, who gave us the most\n\nincredible moment. Selma Blair looked magical. Old Hollywood.\n\nUm. Oh, gosh. Who do we have here?\n\nLooking like a vision in gold. But let's kick things off. Let's really get things going with the\n\nwonderful Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine. Hi, Ben.\n\nGood to see you. Hi, Christine. Good to see you.\n\nHi. You lot. How are you?\n\nI'm so. well, I would love to really focus on you and I promise I'm going to come back.\n\nBut your wife, Christine, you look like a knockout.\n\nThank you so much. Do you get a temp check from Ben before you head out of the house?\n\nI do, you do? I feel like he's my biggest fan. Oh, I know.\n\nI mean, this is. Yeah. This was very special, though.\n\nWould you tell her if you were like, honey, I don't know. No, no no, no, I'd say that's the\n\nright answer. That is the right answer. That is the right answer.\n\nNow, can I gush real quick about severance? Oh. Thank you.\n\nNo thank you. I was obsessed with season one. I saw Adam last year, and I'm sure you get\n\nthis reaction a lot at the end of the season. One, I literally stood up from my sofa and held the TV because I couldn't believe that\n\nthat's the way you ended it. Um, the installation you did for the launch of season two was wild.\n\nGrand central station? Yes. Yeah.\n\nUm, can you tell me what the response has been from the audience for season two? It's been so exciting because we were off the\n\nair for three years, as you know. Yeah. And we had a really strong sort of almost\n\nlike a cult audience. I think for the first season, people who were so into it.\n\nBut it wasn't, I don't think, huge numbers. And then the second season, we were offered three years and we came back and somehow a\n\nlot of people discovered us, and we're really happy about that.\n\nI don't know if you know this, Ben, I think. Have you been to England much? Do you know what a tenner is?\n\nWhen I say a tenner, it means 10 pounds. Okay. You might owe me a tenner or 20.\n\nBecause I am the reason that so many people tuned in for season two. I have told everyone I know.\n\nThank you everyone, and I've said it a thousand times over. It's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. I loved it so much. Thank you everybody who works on the show.\n\nWe have such an amazing team of people making the show so incredible, incredible, um, I did this might be a little controversial, but I'm\n\ngoing to go here. You're one for clapping back on social.\n\nMhm. Um. Oh yeah.\n\nUh, which is really surprising. Yeah. Was it just a night I find it fun.\n\nWas it just one night thing, or are you just like, you just want to comment on what you're seeing?\n\nIt depends. It just depends what mood I'm in. By the way, you're moving your hand.\n\nI'm like, you've got an opinion. I want to hear it. No, no.\n\nDo you tell him not to? I always say do not engage. Yeah, but sometimes you feel like engaging\n\nand you give it a shot. I get, but to be honest, it's hard not to engage.\n\nYeah. Okay, on that note, go engage with everyone behind me.\n\nEnjoy your night. You both look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nLovely. Lovely to see you. Amazing.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay.\n\nWhen it comes to pop culture, no one has their finger on the pulse. Quite like Hannah Berner and Paige Desorbo,\n\naka the Giggly Squad, who are here to chat with the stars the only way they can. Hello, ladies.\n\nWhat's going on? Hello, tan. No, the giggly squad is here.\n\nWe are so scared right now. It's a lot of yelling, but the best people watching I've ever seen.\n\nAnd let's not make her wait anymore. Amy Poehler, can you come in away from us, Amy?\n\nGet right in the middle. Tom. Get in here!\n\nOkay. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nThank you. Thank you. So, since when are women in comedy just so\n\nbeautiful? Since 2025. Since 2025.\n\nSomething happened in the planets. No. Women have always been beautiful and funny.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prepare for a night like this? Ooh.\n\nLike a salmon. Salmon like facial or something. Like a mucin situation?\n\nYeah. I wish I don't do. I don't think I do enough.\n\nEvery time I like, I, you know, I ate a croissant today, which is like, I don't do enough.\n\nYou wrapped yourself in velvet, and I love that. Thank you very much.\n\nI gorgeous. I had the trifecta tonight, which never happens where I liked how.\n\nI'm just going to say I like how I look, which never happens. You can say that Timothée Chalamet say I want\n\nto be one of the greatest. You're the greatest of how you look like the Michael Jordan of this party.\n\nYes. Um, and, um, and I liked how it looked. I had fun with my date, and my feet don't\n\nhurt though. That's it. It's only going downhill from here, Amy.\n\nWhen you go in there, what are you at a party like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nI cannot wait to leave. Yeah, yeah, I get that. I cannot wait to get in there so I can do a\n\nlap and then leave. I heard they have the best food, like at this party.\n\nI saw an In-N-Out truck. Fantastic. Yeah.\n\nNow, Amy, you've had some of the most viral moments in the world. Do you feel pressure?\n\nThe whole world, at least. America. Do you feel pressure to, like, outdo your\n\nviral moments, or have you just settled with the greatness that you already have? Thank you so much for saying that.\n\nI do think award shows are kind of funny, and they should be silly and people take them very seriously.\n\nAnd I, you know, it's a big night for a lot of people. I understand they work really hard, but I do\n\nlike it when people goof around. They work hard. But I think when people goof around, it's\n\nfun. So you're saying if you won an Oscar, you wouldn't cry?\n\nI mean, I feel like I feel like I would just disassociate so much. I'm not sure I would cry, but is that the\n\nprice that like you should want? I feel like you have to shed one tear. Even if it's a fake one.\n\nJust shed one. One just a single tear. When you're getting married, if the guy\n\ndoesn't cry. Immediate divorce, divorce I get. I have a lot of feelings about men that cry\n\nat weddings. It's very strange to me. We have time to talk about it.\n\nActually, when they saw we talk about it, they haven't told us to stop yet.\n\nNo. They said. They just said, wrap it up.\n\nThey said, wrap it up. Amy, you're the best. Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nYou look beautiful. We'll send it to Andy over there.\n\nHi, kids. Here's another star lighting up the red carpet.\n\nHe's right there in the screen. Hi, Andy. Look at him.\n\nOh, a corduroy look. He's right there. She's right there.\n\nWhere are you? Holy. Should we talk?\n\nDo you know what? This interview is over. It's these two chatting to each other.\n\nHi, Andy. Good to see you. How are you?\n\nHow are you? Very well. For those who don't know.\n\nLook, I would love to focus on Andy, but I discovered last year that he is married to an icon, Joanna Newsom.\n\nThat's right. I know she couldn't be with us here today. She's hiding away.\n\nShe is. She doesn't do interviews. That's okay.\n\nBut I would like to pretend that you're her tonight. Give me what you got.\n\nHow's life? How's it treating you? Um.\n\nYou've been to this party before. What's it like being married to Andy Samberg? Uh.\n\nOh, boy. I can't answer the last one. Uh, life is beautiful.\n\nOur life is full. Uh, there's music and love flowing out of our home.\n\nI did ask you off camera if she sings around the house and you said yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you request it, or is she just voluntarily volunteers it? I never have to request it.\n\nGood. Also, it wouldn't matter if I did. Okay, good.\n\nIt happens when? When she wants it to happen. Dream.\n\nAbsolute dream. Um, can you talk about SNL 50? Oh, yeah.\n\nTell me about it. Stressful. Exciting.\n\nCan you believe it's 50? It was stressful for me because I worked on it a lot up until it was happening, and then\n\nit was absolute joy and so much fun and being there and watching it live and seeing so many incredible stars from the history of the show\n\ninteracting and doing comedy together and Paul McCartney performing and Lil Wayne and Paul Simon and like, it was kind of like\n\nrelentlessly incredible. It was very overwhelming. It was one of the most exciting moments in TV\n\nI've seen in a really long time. And the fact that you got to be a part of it is just mind blowing.\n\nIt was cool. I met Bonnie Raitt. All right, we're gonna end there.\n\nYeah. We can't beat that. Thank you so much.\n\nI'll see you at the party. Yeah. It's untoppable.\n\nIt is what it is. Thank you. Tan.\n\nWe're joined by the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. Hi.\n\nNo. Our Lord and savior. Literally.\n\nI'll take it. Have you had any moments yet with any celebs? Like in the bathroom or anything fun in the\n\nline? Have you have you crossed paths with anyone or are you like, pretty cool because you've\n\ndone this for a long time. I mean, I feel like I've been coming here for for a good minute of everyone.\n\nNo, you're definitely not sick of everyone. I feel like the last carpet I did was literally a year ago here.\n\nWow. So, wait, when you were to be back when you were preggers, I was popping.\n\nOh my God. Should we have a baby or not? Great question, Hannah.\n\nGreat question. Yes. Okay, fine.\n\nAnd we'll do it. Yes. Well, Keke Palmer just popped one out.\n\nYou just popped one out. And you guys are, like, iconic in every way. Thank you.\n\nAre you. You do what you can. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Vanessa, also, we have to talk about your dress because it's stunning.\n\nI love a feather. I'm a big feather girl. I think they're so good.\n\nWhat's like your process when you're picking your Vanity Fair? Look, because it's different from other red\n\ncarpets. Yeah. I mean, like, I am that girl who genuinely\n\ntries on a dress, and the first one I try on is always the dress.\n\nIt's like a man. It's like a man. You gotta go with your instincts.\n\nIt's like a man. Yeah. It's dating.\n\nIf you don't know in the first 30s. It's not for you, honey. I have a controversial question.\n\nYes. Side part or middle part? I'm normally a middle part girl.\n\nI know. Tonight we're rocking. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm so jealous cause I can't pull off a look at that. You can pull off a side.\n\nYou totally can. Believe in yourself. Okay.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could either. But you just got to go for it.\n\nI'm making this interview about me, and I need to stop. I need to stop.\n\nSo are you. Is there any fashion look that you're kind of or trend that you're kind of over?\n\nI don't know. I mean, nothing really pops to mind.\n\nI mean, I feel like we saw a lot of, like, bigger is better moments. I mean, Cynthia's dress, that Louis Vuitton\n\nwas so iconic. I don't know how she sat. Yeah.\n\nNo, I don't know if she did. It was art. Yeah, it was art.\n\nIt was truly art. The girls are standing on business today. Yeah.\n\nVanessa, thank you so much for stopping by. We'll see you inside. Have fun and welcome back.\n\nYes. And shout out to your baby tan. Back to you.\n\nThank you. Gosh, I love it. Back to me.\n\nPeople are arriving on the carpet. Have you seen them all? They're looking incredible.\n\nWho we got? Serena Williams looking like a vision. VA VA voom has an incredible two.\n\nWho else we got on that red carpet? You know, I can barely see. I'm short sighted.\n\nHere we go. Okay, who have I got? Do you know what?\n\nNever mind. Now let's go to our fellow co-hosts, actor and filmmaker Francesca Scorsese, who's with\n\nSarah Paulson. Okay, so I'm here with Sarah Paulson. Welcome.\n\nThank you. You've worked with Ryan Murphy on so many twisted Tales.\n\nWhat is your favorite horror trope? My favorite horror trope.\n\nOh, God. You know, it's a hard question. The final girl.\n\nI always loved. The final girl. I've been the final girl a couple of times.\n\nThat's true. I'm looking forward to not being the final girl sometimes, but the final girl trope\n\nworks for me. Good. And you've done everything from horror to\n\ndrama. What genre would you like to explore that you haven't yet?\n\nOh, I'd like to do a big stinking comedy because nobody lets me do it.\n\nSince I'm wearing this dress, I feel like comedy will lend itself because, you know, go big or go home is my my motto.\n\nYeah, I love that. That's amazing. And what is the first thing that you plan to\n\ndo when you get into the party? Go straight to the bar. Amazing.\n\nAnd if anyone doesn't say that, they're a loser. Yeah, totally.\n\nI mean, I mean, for all the sober people out there. I don't mean that about you.\n\nI can just, you know, we live in a world now where I'm going to get 22 tweets about how no tweets.\n\nDoes anybody tweet anymore? Okay. I mean, yes, but blue sky, what are we doing\n\nthese days? I don't even really know. I don't even know what it's called.\n\nBlue sky. Blue sky. Sky.\n\nBlue sky. Or blue sky.

Sofia.\n\nStunning. Thank you guys so much. You're so good.\n\nThank you. I feel like you are the trendiest girl on this carpet right now.\n\nBut you know what? I love you because I feel like you don't even want to be trendy.\n\nYou. You just do things, and then it goes into, like, you're not planning it.\n\nYeah. You know what? I'm really just waking up and living my life.\n\nBut I'm really glad that everyone's on board. No, you are the coolest one here, for sure. She put, like, conditioner on her hair cause\n\nshe was tired and everyone just copied her and was like. And now we put conditioner, coconut oil\n\nbecause my hair was greasy. Yeah. And it worked out.\n\nA lot of power comes. Great responsibility. What's the next trend?\n\nDo you think is going to be happening? Give us what are we going to do?\n\nGuys don't follow trends. That's the next trend. Don't follow a trend.\n\nSo iconic of you to say that was so iconic. Okay, I have a fashion question. Okay.\n\nYou come to a lot of these. You're always like the belle of the ball. You always get on the best dressed list.\n\nWhat's your process like? How do you know when you like a dress and when you don't?\n\nLike, what's your vibe when you're in a fitting? Like, I take a lot of photos in fittings.\n\nThat's a big part of my process. Um, other than that, it's. I have to feel comfortable.\n\nYeah. And I have to feel like a bad bee. Do you ever care what your husband thinks?\n\nOh, 100%. 100%. We've never.\n\nPaige is never asked a man anything. 100%. My husband has good taste.\n\nMy husband has really good taste. I mean, he wears glasses. He's smart so he can see better.\n\nTinted glasses. Always trust a man with tinted glasses. We love you guys.\n\nWe love both of you and your baby. Thank you. Sophia.\n\nCongratulations. Thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me on.\n\nBack to tan. Thank you. Los Angeles is the heart of Hollywood, but\n\nthe recent wildfires have deeply impacted this city. Matt Bomer is here to share how the community\n\nis coming together to rebuild. Thank you. Tan.\n\nI am here with Courtney Bailey, who oversees fundraising for Mptf, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which is a wonderful\n\norganization close to my heart because they're committed to helping everyone in our industry in times of need.\n\nThe recent devastation caused by the LA wildfires demonstrates how critical Mptf is to members of our community who have lost\n\neverything and who are now trying to rebuild their livelihood.\n\nAnd it's not just actors, right, Courtney?

Oh my gosh, do we have a best dressed?\n\nOkay, I don't want to give any early predictions, but who do you like? No, I'm gonna say I loved Kim Kardashian.\n\nI was just about to say it, but I didn't want to be too obvious. She looked incredible.\n\nShe was giving cloud a ethereal. She was honestly giving bed vibes and I loved it.\n\nI also thought that her friend Steph Shep looked amazing. Steph.\n\nGorgeous. Gorgeous. Iconic.\n\nShe's always chic and as you would say, tan. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nAbsolutely stunning. You know who else was stunning? Who?\n\nI'm jealous that you got to speak to Nicole. Oh, well, she's just elegant in every way.\n\nSofia. Sofia. I was gonna say I got her name wrong.\n\nSofia. I was gonna roll with it. I was like, I was like, you are such a ride\n\nor die. You're such a ride. Thank you so much.\n\nI You guys, you guys have got to stop you. Are you looking at the monitor? Look at Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI mean, okay, shades on a red carpet for Jeff.\n\nLook how he's posing. Oh, I love him so much, guy. Okay, you guys, how's your first time going?\n\nThis is your first night hosting this. Are you doing okay? Holding up?\n\nThere's so much adrenaline. We took two beta blockers, and we are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe can't feel a thing right now. Beta blocker.\n\nWe wouldn't feel it. Has there been anyone that you were desperate to talk to that just passed you?\n\nThis is. Well, Serena Williams. Where is she?\n\nOh, don't get me started. She's agile. She got away.\n\nDid she? She's the fastest woman on the planet. So I think I missed her, but I heard people\n\nyelling, so I'm really upset. But I'm a tennis nerd. So that was I was.\n\nI'm obsessed with everything she does. We also we missed Julia Fox, which I'm livid about.\n\nShe did look incredible. I do love that you made a sport reference though, Hannah, as if I might know what\n\nyou're talking about, so I'm gonna have to move on real quick. Francesca's on the red carpet with Leslie and\n\nChelsea. I feel like I'm so excited. You've given me a microphone.\n\nIt's all over. Your job is going to be gone. I know.\n\nHonestly, if I could go. Okay.\n\nI'm so excited to have you guys join me. This is the lovely Chelsea Handler and Leslie Bibb.\n\nThank you. So if the two of you were to team up for a comedy show, what would it be about?\n\nOh, it would have to be some sort of road trip, right?\n\nThink Thelma and Louise. We're on a train. Like a high end train like the Orient Express\n\nor meets Midnight Run. Something like that. Yeah, I think it's Thelma and Louise meets\n\nMidnight Run. And we wouldn't have to do much acting. It would just be improvizational and just\n\nwith, like, loose, loose outlines.\n\nYes, absolutely. This would be exactly what's happening. Her talking and me laughing.\n\nThat's amazing, I love it. And Leslie, The White Lotus is all about secrets and scandals.\n\nSo if this party had a twist ending, what would it be? If this party had a surprise ending.\n\nYeah, we all die.\n\nI mean, that would be very White Lotus. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBody. One body bag. Not one body bag.\n\nOne body bag. No one. You need Mike white.\n\nMike White I'm not a writer, but Mike white would tell you what's best. I love it.\n\nThank you both so, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nOh, VA VA VA voom. Gabrielle Union looks absolutely stunning. Gosh, I love a column dress.\n\nAnd she looks gorgeous in that. Um, who do we have next? Who's this vision?\n\nUm, do you know that dress? Couldn't be hotter. Oh, my God, it's Cyd Sydney Sweeney.\n\nHi, baby girl. Oh, she looks absolutely beautiful when she not looked gorgeous.\n\nI've got to say, Julia Garner might be on my best dressed list for the night.\n\nI'm assuming it's Gucci because she is their brand ambassador and looks Heavenly yaskin.\n\nAnd that girl knows how to pose. Gosh that's good. Love that.\n\nI love that she's giving us texture. Christina Ricci ah, we call her Nina. Hi, Nina.\n\nUm, Christina's looking beautiful.\n\nOh, wow. Oh, and here we have Ben. Gorgeous.\n\nBen. Um, okay. Shall we get back to it?\n\nFrancesca's on the carpet with our darling Dan and Clea.\n\nLet's hit it.\n\nSo I am joined by Dan Levy and Clea Duvall. Thank you so much for being here and for talking, for having us.\n\nUm, Dan, you've mastered the art of fashion both on and off screen. How do you stay true to your personal style?\n\nI don't know, I always feel like when you try something on and you feel your best in it, that's generally what you should be going\n\nwith. But often people can put you in some pretty easy stuff.\n\nYeah. Do you think it's fashion, but if you can't wear it, there's no point.\n\nIt's all the confidence of it. So anyway, sometimes the simpler way to go is always the best.\n\nIt's true, it's true. And is there a genre or role that you've always wanted to explore that you haven't\n\nyet? Um, I mean, I'm fascinated for this answer.\n\nI the genre I'm most excited about is one that I've actually been in as an actor, but as a director, I'd really like to do horror.\n\nLove that. I would love to do horror. I love horror.\n\nI don't think anyone would take me seriously in a horror, really. I would put you in a horror movie.\n\nHorror? Yeah. Okay, great.\n\nOkay, done. Thank you. A horror film.\n\nOkay. All right, so who asked who to this event? Do you guys have, like, a kind of promposal\n\nthing? I said, Cleo, will you come to the Vanity Fair party with me in rose petals?\n\nYeah, in front of Cleo's House. I burst into tears. Into tears.\n\nWow. And I said, of course. The rest is history for us.\n\nReally? God. That's amazing.\n\nThat's so lovely. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nThank you for. Thank you for joining me. And I hope you have the best.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nGosh, Mr. Stanfield, you have never looked more handsome. I love a Saint Laurent suit on a man.\n\nAnd I'm assuming this is his partner who is looking equally stunning. Wow.\n\nCould you imagine being a couple? That's hot. That is that hot?\n\nLike, where do you go from there? You wake up in the morning just knowing this is it.\n\nYou're perfect. Um, you guys, at some point soon, hopefully we're going to see Selena Gomez because she\n\njust rocked up and I see her in line and she's looking she's standing right behind us and we're trying to get out.\n\nI'm so jealous. I know I tried to pretend I was cool too. She looked incredible.\n\nI'm sweating just knowing she's near because I don't want her to know we're talking about her.\n\nNah. Do it. Do it.\n\nShe's wearing so many diamonds. I just burnt out my retina. And you know what?\n\nThe thing is? She's not. They're not on loan, I bet.\n\nLike she's Quincy. She can afford to keep those.\n\nYeah, those are hers. Those are just. Those are her.\n\nHer Saturday night diamonds. Not the regular. Like dishwashing diamonds.\n\nShe'll wear those in the kitchen, I'm sure. She's one of those guys. She also must be tired because she has been\n\non a press run. Do you know what? No.\n\nThat one's got so much energy. She's been doing this for years. She is trained.\n\nShe's a machine. True. I did watch her documentary.\n\nShe's been busy for a long time. Yeah. And she's not stopping anytime soon.\n\nOh, I love when men go for something fun. And they don't just do the traditional.\n\nIt's pirate chic. Pirate chic? Yeah.\n\nI love that you're calling it pirate chic. It is fully Saint Laurent. And you just referred to it as pirate chic.\n\nLOL. Saint Laurent loves a boat.\n\nSaint Laurent has been on a boat before. That's so funny. That's so funny.\n\nAll right. One of the best things about award season is getting to see a more candid, unfiltered side\n\nof Hollywood's biggest stars. Vanity Fair has been capturing such moments for some of our favorite nominees and winners\n\nall season long. They remain. They're still in the city.\n\nThe aspirations of the film really speak to me on many levels. One as an artist, as someone who wants to\n\nleave behind a body of work that is of some significance.\n\nEven distilling work in a film is similar to an architect erecting a building and creating something.\n\nThere's a foundation of work.\n\nSo joining me now is the host of this fabulous party, Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones.\n\nWelcome. Hi, Francesca. Hi.\n\nWhat is so special about tonight? Well, the Oscar party is always special. It is the end of a long season of hard work\n\nand campaigning on the part of the actors and directors and everyone who comes to the party.\n\nIt's it's such an incredible night of celebration, and it's literally the high point of many people's lives.\n\nIt's like the night that they win an Oscar, so that's great. But, you know, we're also conscious this year\n\nthat it's been a difficult start to the year for LA with the wildfires.\n\nWe are happy to be partnering with Baby to Baby and Mptf to provide help out with some wildfire relief for families and for industry\n\nprofessionals. So it feels good to be here to lift those causes up and also to celebrate some amazing\n\ntalent. That's amazing. And what does this party mean to you?\n\nI mean, well, I was thinking on the way over. This is my seventh Oscar party. Lucky seven.\n\nI know. So I think it's going to be a great night. And honestly, it's just so much fun and\n\neveryone comes in and has a wonderful time, so I'm looking forward to the same.\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much and enjoy. Thank you.\n\nAwesome. We are joined by Madison Beer, who I currently have beef with because we both have\n\nthe same good side. We're both going to talk to her like this. That's so crazy.\n\nBecause Hannah wouldn't let me stand on that side for my dress. It's a real fight.\n\nI actually need to stand like this, too. But the crazy thing is, Madison beer does not have a bad side.\n\nAnd you? You do? What are you talking about?\n\nNo. She does. No, I do.\n\nI really do. I do. She said no, you do.\n\nI Vanity Fair Vanity Fair almost fired me because of it.\n\nWait, you're you're singing. Career is blowing up. Your fashion has never been better.\n\nOh my God. What are the vibes right now? I don't know.\n\nAre you excited to be here and talking to us? Absolutely. I'm so honored that I'm here.\n\nThis is amazing. And I feel like you're so nice of you. Sorry.\n\nYou've done. No, she's really nice. She's not looking over here.\n\nSorry. I'm like. You're so nice.\n\nOh my God. I love you guys.\n\nShould we just go in and have a cocktail? I feel like we just want.\n\nOh, wait. So when you're at a party, who are you like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nAre you socializing? Are you just observing? No.\n\nI'm terrified. You're terrified the whole time. But I'm trying to be more confident just in\n\ngeneral. Even if it's, like, fake it till you make it, you know?\n\nYeah. This is how we got here. Trying really hard.\n\nYeah, we lied on our resume when we got here. It's just been fake it till you make it. Yeah.\n\nYeah, I think I'm just trying to be more confident, but internally, I'm like, who am I?\n\nWell, what's your trick when you're not feeling confident, what's your go to thing to do?\n\nPretend. Yeah, you have to pretend. And that's why you deserve an Oscar one day.\n\nIf there's someone that you look up to that you feel like always embodies, like, confidence and stuff, think about them.\n\nThat's what I do. Honestly, I'll think about someone that I'm like, I know this person is always eating.\n\nThey're always confident I love, and I just, like, honestly pretend that I'm them if I'm feeling insecure.\n\nOkay, we have to talk before you go. We have to talk about your dress. Yes.\n\nUB sass. Thank you. It's giving old Hollywood.\n\nI love the black and white. Yeah. No, she's a tall drink of water.\n\nShe's so gorgeous. And I love the high pony. Thank you.\n\nHow do you pick your hairstyle for, like, to match the dress? I never wear my hair up.\n\nEver. Neither do I. Are we twins?\n\nWe look the same. I hate my ears. We do look the same.\n\nWe're twins. Wait. Someone told me I had elf ears when I was\n\ngrowing up. Someone was like. You should get your ears pinned back.\n\nAnd it ruined my life. So here we are. That's so crazy.\n\nI love my ears. No, no, she loves. And you can hear me so well right now.\n\nYou know what I mean? No, absolutely I do. I can hear them across the street.\n\nNo, but nothing gets past you. I honestly just, like, I don't know, I just feel like I try to look at an outfit.\n\nI honestly did this fitting with my hair up, and I was like, I kind of like it, and I hate that I like it.\n\nSo hopefully I don't hate all the photos that come out. No, you crushed it.\n\nYou're absolutely. We look up to you. You killed all the time to think about you.\n\nWhen we want to be confident, when we get inside. Yes.\n\nWe love you. Back to him.\n\nI'm thinking. No thank you. Thank you for doing this.\n\nYou okay? I don't get this. I could.\n\nI'm sorry. You caught me gossiping. I know we were.\n\nWe were gossiping. Emma's my girl, I love you. You know I love you so much.\n\nSo much. This is all the conversation is gonna be. I love you so much.\n\nWe're just gonna gush, but I'm gonna be professional and say this. Okay.\n\nYou look incredible. Thank you so much. Now, I do need you to know.\n\nI knew as soon as she walked off, I was like Jean-Paul Gaultier, right? Yeah.\n\nObviously, it's Jean-Paul Gaultier. Bye, Ludovic. Unbelievable.\n\nI, like, saw this collection, and I was like, if I don't wear that, I'm gonna be sad. I'm gonna be heartbroken with the hat.\n\nLike, it's all so tough, baby. Thank you. It's so tough.\n\nIt's the best you've ever looked. Wait. Stop!\n\nIs it? Thank you. I know she always looks good.\n\nAnd I need you to know I said it off camera, too. And if I don't like someone's.\n\nLook, I don't say it. I love that about you. I'll find a way to come up with something\n\nelse. I love that. It's the best you've ever looked.\n\nI love the short on you. And it's not easy to pull off for most people.\n\nThank you for giving me 80s. I love that. Well, I just like to be honest.\n\nThe reason why I did it and the reason why I chopped it all off was because, honestly. Well, I wanted a change.\n\nI was kind of sick of, like, long hair. I've had it my whole life. But also, it's so much easier to have short\n\nhair. I wake up. Sure is.\n\nAnd my hair is just done. I love that we are almost twinning.\n\nI'm going to go. I'm going to go for your blond soon, I'm sure.\n\nLet's do it I would love I would love so much. Good.\n\nOkay. We were talking about this before you guys joined us.\n\nChamberlain. Coffee? Yes.\n\nYou launched a store? Yes. Wait.\n\nWhat are we calling it? A cafe. Cafe?\n\nA cafe? A cafe that went nuts. It's been truly like an incredible\n\nblessing. Is this the first of many? It's the first of many, hopefully.\n\nBut I always am like. Oh, God. Now, did I jinx it or something?\n\nBut I would love to give me an exclusive. Where's the next one? Opening?\n\nI actually don't know. You know, I would give you the exclusive, but.\n\nAll right, all right. But we're, like, almost house hunting. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's like. Which is so fun. Yeah, we're shopping for the next place, but\n\nit's like you want the aura of the space to be, right? And that takes time.\n\nI'm telling you, this one's going to rule the world one day. She's the baddest around, all right?\n\nRight. If you don't rule the world first, I can't gush anymore.\n\nYou got to go. She's gonna go to the party. I'm gonna see you in the party.\n\nI love you. I love you. I love this girl.\n\nI love you. That's it, that's it. We're out.\n\nI'm going home. I'll see you all later. No.\n\nI'm joking. Well, come join us. Come join us.\n\nLook at this switcheroo. Don't worry about it. Hello, Alan.\n\nHow are you, sir? Good to see you. Very well.\n\nThanks. You're so dapper. You look so dapper.\n\nSo I met you at a party earlier on this year or last year with Corinna.\n\nUm. And you were wearing a gorgeous white suit. And I asked her was that man styled himself\n\nbecause he looks incredible. And you do stuff that most people don't do. Can you tell me about how you get ready for\n\nan event. Do you work with a status or do you just tell yourself?\n\nNo, I work with the stylist Erica Cloud, but do you push that stylist to push you harder because you don't dress like most men?\n\nI do push her to like. I push her to push me. Do you?\n\nYou care about fashion? I do care about fashion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's very much a, like a, like a big part of my life. And I have, like, whenever the cameras\n\nweren't rolling. Yeah. You know, and, um, living in Los Angeles and\n\nnow living in New York, you know, the style is the is the same, but it's different. It sure is.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Yeah, I think the I, you know, I've never\n\nworn sweatpants on a plane, I'll say that. You haven't? Gosh, I live in sweatpants on a plane.\n\nAbsolutely not. I think it's crazy when people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nOkay, wait. I think it's crazy that people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nAbsolutely crazy. I think it's so insane. I just wanna be comfortable.\n\nOkay, enough about fashion. Because I really want to talk about White Lotus.\n\nAnd I know I don't have you for long, right? Um, the the new season of White Lotus has gone nuts, like everyone is talking about it.\n\nDo you do you feel pressure going into White Lotus because it's such a massive show? Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think anybody would be lying if they didn't. If they didn't say that.\n\nYeah. You feel pressured. You don't want to disappoint Mike white first\n\nand foremost. And you don't want to disappoint the fans. Yeah.\n\nAnd you don't want to disappoint the people that you're working with. Right.\n\nYeah. But all of those concerns, like coming to your mind, even, like working with Quentin,\n\nyou know, like Tarantino a couple of times. You always have that kind of going into an experience.\n\nYeah. And then, you know, pretty quickly thereafter, you realize, oh, wait a minute,\n\nI'm a storyteller. That's what I do for a living. I'm going to tell this story as best I can.\n\nNot just the best you can. You're killing it. I'm loving.\n\nI'm such a massive fan. I'm loving the new season. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd you're so damn good on it. Thank you, I think. Terrifying.\n\nA complete A-hole. But I know that you're a lovely man in real life now.\n\nI promise. I promise you that. That by the end of it, we'll fall in love\n\nwith you when it's all said and done. This guy, Rick Hatchet, and the journey that he's on will say something very profound.\n\nAnd it will be visceral in ways that you could not expect. We love a tease that doesn't really give too\n\nmuch away. I'll take that for now. Thank you so much.\n\nWe'll see you in the party. Have fun tonight. Thank you mate.\n\nCheers, buddy. Cheers, buddy. And then we're going to swap.\n\nWe're gonna do a switcheroo again. Look at all these pictures. Thank you so much, mate.\n\nHello, my darling. How are you? Okay, everyone.\n\nCheryl, look at this vision. Um. We did it.\n\nI think I did this with you last year, and I was gagged. I was left gagged, and we had a lovely time.\n\nWell, because you're an angel sent down from heaven. Thank you very much.\n\nYou know, you have the best reputation in Hollywood. Thank you.\n\nUm, can you talk to me about what goes into planning for tonight? Because this is stunning.\n\nThank you. This is Valdrin Sahiti, and my stylist does such an excellent job.\n\nAnd, you know, I think about where we started three years ago to where we have arrived now. Classic simplicity.\n\nTimeless. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful.\n\nShe's so talented. And you look back in 20 years and say, yeah, I looked incredible.\n\nIt's timeless. Um, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. Yes.\n\nNow, when you get up on stage and you say something, it's always profound. As if I've gone to the most incredible\n\nchurch. Do you plan it in advance or. You just are so beautifully philosophical.\n\nAlways. You know something? I'm going to have to take the compliment and\n\nsay that that's just a part of my makeup. It's just a part of who I am as a human being.\n\nI truly, truly believe life is short, and if people don't acknowledge how short it is by spending their days, by being as good as they\n\ncan, as kind as they can, they are wasting their time on this earth.\n\nI could not agree more, and I don't want to take up any more of your time. So go enjoy that party because it's a good\n\none tonight. It's a real good one. The gorgeous Cheryl upstate.\n\nI've got nothing else to say. What's up man? We got Brooklyn, Queens, Albany in the\n\nbuilding. We're actually starting some kind of some kind of band or cult.\n\nJesse, congratulations. You've been on a crazy press tour. Yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. And, like, you've been killing it with Kieran.\n\nOh, thanks. How do you hype yourself up before an interview?\n\nEspecially if you have social anxiety like this one. Yeah.\n\nWe're nervous. If you've heard or seen me in any interviews, I don't hype myself up at all.\n\nI'm very, very low. Low wattage? Yeah.\n\nUnderpromise and overdeliver. That's it. Yeah, exactly.\n\nI'm obsessed with that. Yeah. Have you, like.\n\nDo you like this party? Like, what are you, like, at a party? Like, is this one that you're like, oh, I'm\n\ngoing to dance. Well, I am like, at a party is somebody who's doing a favor for my wife.\n\nYou're a good husband. Oh, it's like. Like your wife took you shopping and you're\n\nsitting and waiting for her. That's like the energy. Pretty much that.\n\nYes, it's pretty much that. And then she often will walk out with a bag. Yes.\n\nYeah, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that a lot. What a date night.\n\nThe Vanity Fair. Yeah. This should net me several things that I\n\ndon't have to go to in the next six months. Has anyone come up to you for a selfie? Who's really famous?\n\nOh, no. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.\n\nNot one person. I couldn't compute your question of like, wait, why?\n\nI don't understand. Oh, have they asked me for a weight? You mean because.\n\nOh, because you're awesome. Jessie. Yeah.\n\nNo no no, no, but I'm not. I think they could tell that I'm not the selfie.\n\nYou're not the kind of guy. Yeah, I think so. I think I give off energy of you'll ruin the\n\nselfie. Something fun. And we had our phones.\n\nWe would take a selfie with you. Then I would. Then you would be my answer.\n\nYeah, yeah, that makes that makes sense. And when you're coming together with a look, do you have opinions with your stylist?\n\nAre you like, this is the vibe I want to put out tonight or does your wife pick your outfits?\n\nUm, sorry. We're hearing a lot of questions.\n\nListen. I'm prepared. No, I they put this on me five minutes before\n\nI left. Yeah. And then, you know, I could take it off and\n\nnever have to wear it until somebody gets married or bar mitzvah in my family for the next several years.\n\nYeah. Do you ever complain about your feet like that?\n\nYour shoes hurt? No. I complain about my feet for other reasons.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, it's kind of more of a bunion issue. Maybe we'll get into that a little later.\n\nThanks. We'll discuss our bunions more in depth. Vanity Fair is telling us we can't discuss\n\nbunions. That's actually the one thing we weren't allowed to talk about tonight.\n\nAre you working on any new projects? How do you find inspiration for a new project?\n\nLook at me. Just asking the deepest question I could think of.\n\nYou know, we're on this purpose on this planet, Jesse. Listen, we all float around for it feels like\n\na second. Um, look, we're just feathers tonight. Makes it feel like gone with the wind.\n\nYes, yes, it's been amazing. Yeah, it's been amazing. And I think people are ready for this\n\ninterview. I think people are going to. I think just with everything that's going on\n\nin the world, I think people are going to be ready for this interview. I know that it's going to change the climate\n\nin some capacity. Yeah. If anything, Hannah's wearing extensions.\n\nI wear extensions really important. Yeah. Do you know what extensions are?\n\nOf course I know what extensions are. Where? Where I can't even get in a fight.\n\nJesse. I was just asking if you knew. I do, and they are seamless.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Would you ever bleach your hair blond.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, definitely. Just like on a movie part, I wouldn't like you wouldn't do it like on a Saturday.\n\nWell, even if you're going through a hard time, you might do it on a Saturday because, you know, usually shooting on Monday.\n\nRight? Okay. So you want to do all the hair dyeing on the\n\nweekend. You're smart with logistics okay. Honestly, he's handled everything we've\n\nthrown at him. And we are so impressed by you. Oh.\n\nThanks, Jesse. You're killing it. Go have fun at the party.\n\nYou've survived. Get away from us! You're so funny.\n\nYou survived. We love you. This was a nice back to you, tan.\n\nThat was great. You guys are great. Oh my God.\n\nJesse, um. Oh, my God, is that Cynthia? Please tell me that.\n\nCynthia. I see the nails. It's got to be Cynthia.\n\nOh, Lina. Love this couple so much. Wow, I love that.\n\nUm, Cynthia's giving us a third look of the night. Well done.\n\nCynthia. Sofia Carson, who said she watched my Netflix specials?\n\nSo obsessed. I love her. We ride at dawn.\n\nLook at this moment. A vision, a vision. You guys.\n\nYou guys look beautiful. How did you decide? Hair up or hair down?\n\nYeah, the hair up was easy because there was a lot. See?\n\nWe're all friends. Sorry. That's Hannah's best friend.\n\nHailey Bieber. We just said hi. Hayley, I'm right here.\n\nThat was crazy. Really cool. No!\n\nStop! It's because she's wearing extensions. I know, she's been acting different.\n\nI Halle Bailey it's the hair. It's the long hair. That's why I asked you.\n\nHair up. There was a lot happening here, so it was an easy decision to take it out.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prep for an event like this? No, I'm pretty boring.\n\nI actually had my first shot of tequila before a carpet. Ever.\n\nJust now. Oh my God. Just now.\n\nHow do you feel? I feel great. Okay, good, good.\n\nNo we're not. It's nice. It's like takes the edge off.\n\nWe're sober. If anyone's wondering, this is us sober. Oh my gosh.\n\nSo when you go to these events, do you have any advice for talking to super famous people?\n\nBecause we've not been doing a great job thus far. What have you guys been doing in your\n\napproach? I just we've just been asking silly questions.\n\nThat's nice though. Yeah. Who are you at a party?\n\nAre you a wallflower? Are you not? I like that.\n\nWe're asking her questions that we asked. We're asking her if our questions were good to other people.\n\nNo. You feel like a girl's girl. And so I feel comfortable.\n\nWe do feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. We do feel comfortable with your energy.\n\nUm, but, yeah, when you go into a party, do you have any advice for, like, looking cool? No, because I'm not cool.\n\nI've never been cool. I was a nerd in school, and I still am, so I just, like, approach them like a fan.\n\nBut I try to be, like, subtle about it. And I still say, like, I just admire you so much and I never know if it's the party to do\n\nit, but everyone seems to take it well. Now I have to ask, did you practice posing in your dress?\n\nYou did practice. What did you come up with? I show you.\n\nYes, yes. Show us please. Okay, so we're fluffing.\n\nWe're fluffing. Keep it down. Yes!\n\nIt's gorgeous. It's like a goddess. This is.\n\nTake note of this. This is important. Right on the hip bone.\n\nRight on the hip bone. It's giving angles. Yes, yes.\n\nOh, my. I'm blind. I'm blind.\n\nThis is crazy. Oh, sorry. Took your mic.\n\nYeah. What's your, like, day to day outfit when you're at home?\n\nThe closest thing to pajamas. Yes. Pajamas.\n\nThe closest thing like to comfy sweats. Oversize everything all the time. Girlhood is about balance.\n\nIt really is. Am I right? When you're right.\n\nWhen you're choosing an outfit. Do you ever choose for comfort? Or do you always go for style?\n\nI've ever chosen for comfort. So to be honest, I will say though, today I was between this dress and another dress that\n\nwas a little out of my comfort zone and this one felt the most me.\n\nYeah. So if that's comfort, then maybe this was the dress, but it's not.\n\nParticularly if you look good, you play good. Exactly. No, it's so true.\n\nIt's about how you feel. Yeah. Yeah, it really is.\n\nSofia, thank you so much for coming. We too nice to us. Such a pleasure.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nGet out of here. Get out of here! Go hang out with someone.\n\nCool. Oh my God! Yes, yes.\n\nUm, okay. I don't even know what to say right now, but my best friend is here.\n\nWe're freaking out. Haley bleeping Bieber is Haley.\n\nHow are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nIt's so nice to meet you. My best friend talks about you all the time. She said my best friend too.\n\nNo, Haley. It's it's. Where's Kendall?\n\nBecause I feel like she's coming. She's coming because that's my best friend you're trying to have, like.\n\nYeah, like a Charlie's Angels moment. You always say crush it on the red carpet. Like, truly, always the queen.\n\nThank you. When you're, like, in the fitting for your dress, for something like this.\n\nDo you know, in the first 30s or are you, like, someone that has to try it on, put it back on, take a picture.\n\nKind of more that because once I try something on, I start conceptualizing the whole thing.\n\nThe hair, the makeup, the whole. You give her a persona? The whole thing head to toe.\n\nBut tonight, I actually was really torn between two dresses. But I went with this one.\n\nIt's custom YSL gorgeous. I love it, I'm super happy.\n\nAnd your skin looks so good. Exactly. That's what I want to know.\n\nWhat road are we wearing right now? Um, well, all my skin prep is always road. And then I also have some of our blush on our\n\npeptide lip shape, a lip treatment. Call it out. Hale's.\n\nCall it out. My mom stole one of my lip treatments. So, mom, we'll discuss this later.\n\nIt's okay. I'll replace it for you. Thank you.\n\nI do, I'm like. Mom, I know someone. I'm good.\n\nSo, Hailey, you go to these parties a lot. Are you ever trying besides me? Are you trying to make any new friends in\n\nthere, or is it kind of. You stick with the group. I'm.\n\nI like to stick with my friends, but I am a social butterfly. I start to kind of just, like, run around and\n\nfly around and talk to people. She literally has an aura around her where you just want to befriend her.\n\nI can feel it. She can literally, literally the best. That's how I feel about you.\n\nAnd now you. Haley. We're the three best friends.\n\nHello. We want to know any posing advice. Because you every carpet you just like.\n\nYou look like you're seven feet tall. I always still get nervous about the way to pose, because, you know, I obviously wanted\n\nto look. Well, they're screaming at you, and it's very overwhelming.\n\nI need a beta blocker. It's very overwhelming. You feel like you're about to get robbed?\n\nYeah. It's crazy. Also, as a mother.\n\nNow on the red carpet. How has it changed your perspective on all these crazy events?\n\nLike having something to ground you? Well, you're just thinking about such different things now.\n\nI'm like, I'm going to go inside and be checking my, my, my baby monitor nonstop. So I have a different mindset.\n\nI have a furbo, so I know I check on my cat. She's a mother. She's a she's a mother.\n\nI'm a mother. To actually Haley as a trendsetter, any trends for that are coming up that you're\n\ninto in terms of fashion because we're just or any trends that you're like, I'm so over it.\n\nYou know, what's so annoying is I just answered that, like, I thought about this the other day and I'm like, people ask me this\n\nquestion a lot. I have to remember my answer and now I forget.\n\nI forget. I'm so annoying. You could literally punch us in the face and\n\nwe don't care. Like you don't have to say anything right now.\n\nYou are incredible. Keeping you. We're obsessed with you.\n\nI'm so happy to see you. Thank you for talking to us.\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for brunch. Get out of here. Get out of here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Lil NAS x, are you kidding me?\n\nOh my God. Guys. We're just.\n\nYay! I like how I'm here. Guys, they have my name with a Z on the\n\nteleprompter instead of an S right now. And we. And that person did just get fired.\n\nYou're fired. No, that person got fired. Get out!\n\nGet them. Literally out also. We've just been staring at ourselves in the\n\nmonitor the whole time, so work it. A vision in white. I'm obsessed.\n\nNo, no, I love it, I love it. I love a cropped blazer, honey. Yes!\n\nOh my God. And the shoe. And the shoes.\n\nCan you, like, lift your leg up? Because I feel like the people at home.\n\nThis is very in right now. I heard, I heard we, Mr. X, I have questions for you.\n\nWhen do you decide to go tiktoking or when do you stop? Because I feel like you.\n\nDo I stop? You know, you go, you disappear for like ten years.\n\nYou come back. Stop it. Right.\n\nHow do you decide? I randomly do it. I like to do it when I like.\n\nHave fun. I don't like to do it, like. Feel like it's an obligation.\n\nYeah. No, I don't like obligated TikTok. Like we.\n\nI wait for this content. I drool for your content, I can't wait. Um, okay.\n\nHow involved are you with putting together looks? Because they're always.\n\nSo you. Yeah. I'm, um.\n\nI'm pretty involved. I never get, like, too crazy. I don't like to step on, like, the stylish\n\ntoes. Yeah. You're not like, yelling.\n\nThey had this. They had this in black. And I was like, okay, can we get it white?\n\nI want to feel godly. Yeah. Can we get, like, on the arm, like my stencil\n\nfor my my next album. Yeah. Like dream boy.\n\nLike I'm getting it on. Yeah. Always be promoting.\n\nPeople don't talk about he lived. He leaves a lot of, um. What does Taylor Swift do?\n\nEaster eggs and stuff. Easter. Easter eggs.\n\nYes. Easter eggs. Shout out to Taylor, shout out Taytay, we\n\nlove you! I need to know, like when you go into a party like this, do you just stunt on everyone\n\nbecause you're a better dancer? Like, are you like, hey, watch this. No, I'm like trying to dance with everybody.\n\nI want to make everybody who looks like they're uncomfortable feel like I'm like. I'm like, yay!\n\nSee if I could dance like you. I'd be like, form a circle around me. I'm going to do something here, you know?\n\nWait, are you guys going to make out? Are you guys going to make out? We're going to do it.\n\nNo, no, not this time. We're streaming so we could. It's not on real time.\n\nNo, no. I'm scared. And also look, his nails look good too.\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yeah. They just came.\n\nThey just came like this. I didn't touch them little things. I used to play your songs all the time to\n\nprep for my stand up. You need to get back to doing it, baby. No, no.\n\nLike when when you're first song came out, you guys aren't going to make out okay. Now he's mad.\n\nNow I'm in a fight. I'm mad. It's okay.\n\nJust scream the next one, okay? I was like, what kind of sexual dungeon are you in right now?\n\nAnd I was like, Lil NAS X. Like, I'm just playing him having fun. No, we are obsessed with you.\n\nYeah. Has anyone, um, like, cool asked you for a selfie?\n\nI'd like to hear tonight. No, because I just got here and I wasn't at the Oscars.\n\nSadly. That's okay. Neither were we.\n\nThis is where the party is. That's cool. Yeah, that was cool.\n\nWhen are you gonna act? When am I going to act? Yeah.\n\nI've had so many opportunities. I keep getting scared. I'm going to do it next time, though.\n\nYeah, do it next time. Getting scared next time. Rooting you on.\n\nYeah. You got it. Euphoria season 18 I'm on you.\n\nImagine if you've been scared in the past. You wouldn't have been where you are today. Okay, I'm not going to.\n\nUm, Mel Robbins, you right now. Let's get back to tan. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you guys so much. Thank you so much. Hi, Lil NAS x.\n\nGosh, that man's handsome. Um. Wow.\n\nGorgeous. Everyone, check out Cynthia. She's always got a look.\n\nShe's one of the best dressed on every red carpet, if not the best.\n\nUm, and this is her third look of the night. She wore two looks at the Oscars, and now she's giving us this drama.\n\nLook at that pose, too. Magical. Magical.\n\nOkay, so we've compared, uh, last year's locks or her past Vanity Fair locks.\n\nIf you see the side of the screen on the right, you'll see what she's worn in the past and she's worn Louis Vuitton in 2024.\n\nIn 2022. Actually, this is the Louis Vuitton look that she wore in 2022.\n\nUm, and the one you just saw was the. Wow. I'm going to repeat that for you.\n\nThis one here is from 2022. And the one with the red backdrop is from 2024 that we saw last year.\n\nAnd she looked gorgeous. Um, and I'm going to throw back to the girls who are with.\n\nLet's see. I can't see I can't see who she's with. Let's see.\n\nShe's with Rachel outside. I will never forget you should. Girls here with Rachel.\n\nWe're literally forgot we were what we were doing as a job. We are here with Rachel Sennott, who's\n\neverywhere right now and is currently going viral for admitting that she's on beta blockers.\n\nAnd, you know, we're on beta blockers. We're strong believers in it. Yeah I didn't.\n\nAre people reacting like it's a big deal? I actually I don't look at the comments. I'm not allowed to.\n\nBut me neither. I think it's a chill, natural thing. Better than heroin.\n\nNatural thing. It truly is. Let me just say it's not something where you\n\nfeel like good, but you just don't feel bad. That's what it is. You don't feel I'm.\n\nI'm literally numb from the neck down. But you know, what I appreciate is we have so much pressure all the time, and people like\n\nto be like, oh, I'm just being me. No, you're like, it gets nerve wracking. And sometimes I pop a pill.\n\nYou can't just raw dog life. That's crazy. No, I'm not being me.\n\nI don't know who this is, but I'm being someone.\n\nI'm obsessed with this dress. You and your stylist, Jared Ellner, are crushing it.\n\nWhat do you tell him before an event to pull off these outfits? Do you have, like, a specific vibe where\n\nyou're like, this is what I want to give tonight? Yeah.\n\nSo, okay. Jared is a genius. Yeah, I would say I want to like Jared, and I\n\nwill mood board. Like, sometimes he'll come over to my house, and then we'll just pull a bunch of photos.\n\nLike, let's just Pinterest a quesadilla. Yeah. But I will say Jared has the vision.\n\nLike he always I'm like, you're amused. He shows me something, and sometimes I'll be like, I don't know.\n\nAnd then I put it on and I'm like, you're a genius. Also, Rachel is hysterical, but also, like,\n\niconically beautiful. You're known for your pout. Can you teach us how to do your iconic pout?\n\nLet's do it in the camera. Like, how do we pull it off? I would say so what?\n\nWhat side of your face do you like better? This. We've been over this.\n\nNo, we've been fighting about it. Okay, so do your favorite side of the face. Okay.\n\nChin down. A little kind of dead eyes. Dead.\n\nAnd then. Sorry, I can't talk because I'm doing it, so.\n\nOh, I feel like I feel like we got the energy of it, though.\n\nBlow out of the lips. I think we got it. I'm obsessed.\n\nAlso, as a comic, you're chatty. You're a yapper. So am I.\n\nTotally. Are you yapping to people in there, or are you playing it cool to everyone?\n\nAre you kidding me? I can't not yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're not yapping, you're not\n\nyapping. Are you alive? You're not living, you know.\n\nRachel Sennott, get out there. We love you. We can't wait to watch your new show coming\n\nout. I'm so excited. Thank you.\n\nThank you, guys for coming. Back to you. Thank you for shopping with us.\n\nAnd we have all been heartbroken by the devastating fires that have ravaged Los Angeles.\n\nFrancesca is with one local organization aiding in the recovery.\n\nI'm here with Nora and Kelly from the incredible organization Baby to Baby. We all know that the Oscars celebrate the\n\nbest performances. What is the best act of kindness that you've witnessed recently?\n\nWell, baby to baby. We've had so many people coming to volunteer to help the cause, coming to donate supplies,\n\nbut also providing, you know, funds and emergency essentials to baby to baby and the families and children we serve.\n\nPeople have been coming in to volunteer just in droves from across the country and here in LA, but also people who even lost their own\n\nhomes have been showing up for us to support the families affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fire.\n\nSo it's been really incredible to see. That's amazing. That's beautiful.\n\nVanity Fair is thrilled to be partnering with Baby to Baby this year, and you've all done so much for children and families here in LA.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your work so far?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so grateful to Vanity Fair for the resources for coming in and rolling up their\n\nsleeves. And helping baby to Baby provides emergency essentials to children and babies in\n\nparticular. And so already in the last eight weeks, we've distributed 12 million items, including\n\ndiapers, wipes, hygiene products, blankets, strollers, cribs, clothing and those are going to children and families and babies\n\nimpacted by both the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nWow. That's amazing. And now that the LA community is turning\n\ntoward rebuilding, What plans does baby to baby have for the future?\n\nWell, we know from our disaster response because we've been doing it for over ten years that families really need help for\n\nmonths and years to come. It's not just these eight weeks, I mean, and immediately, obviously, we were able to\n\ndistribute these emergency supplies to children and families.\n\nBut this will continue and our work will continue for a long time to come. It's a long road ahead for families,\n\nespecially who've lost their homes, their jobs, their livelihoods. So baby to baby will be here.\n\nAnd we can't thank Vanity Fair enough for the incredible support they've given.\n\nThank you Francesca. We are with the one and only Jeremy Pope. This is what my husband wants to do to me\n\nwhen I get too chatty. That's. You look incredible.\n\nWhat is the story of that? What is the story tonight? I'm feeling inspired.\n\nI'm feeling creative. I'm in my Dune era. We're celebrating Dune.\n\nNo, it's. It was a fun look that I love. It's Egan lab.\n\nI pulled it to myself, you are wearing like, are these heels or platforms like a Rick Owens?\n\nCan I, can I lift a little? Okay. Yeah.\n\nNow are they comfy? Are they are a big old chunky platform okay.\n\nAnd if you get tired in the party, you can just literally wrap that around your head. And if you don't want to talk to people, just\n\ncover it up. Wait. I love a man wearing at least some platforms\n\nbecause we're this close to tearing an ACL at all times, and Men Don't Understand has never been the same.\n\nNo, if Prince can do it, then we should all be able to do it. I love Prince, he was a big inspiration in\n\nthis look tonight. Yes. Oh my God.\n\nUm, also, do you get annoyed with people saying your eyes are beautiful?\n\nI appreciate it, that wasn't a compliment. No, you were just saying that was a statement.\n\nJust a statement. I am very grateful. No, JP, we love you.\n\nThank you for coming and getting that party. You're awesome. So much fun.\n\nAh, JP, which does sound like a lacrosse player. JP I did, um, tan back to you.\n\nGood one. Hannah, thank you so much. I am now joined by Conan and his lovely wife,\n\nLiza. Hi, guys. It's a big night for you.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was really fun.\n\nOkay. Was it fun going in, or is it fun now that it's over?\n\nUh, it was fun when you get to hit the stage. Okay. And then before.\n\nThat is a lot of worrying and work. Okay. A lot of worrying and work.\n\nAnd Liza was very patient. Well, the funny thing is, last couple of months, because I've been a little bit of a\n\nmental case, but once you get on the stage and you're ready, it's fun.\n\nConan, um, I know that this is about you right now, but I need your wife's opinion.\n\nCan you tell me the real, real. What's he like preparing for something like this?\n\nIs he wildly frustrating at home? Not frustrating, not frustrating, not frustrating.\n\nJust very. I have my moments. Does he does he hard working and focused?\n\nAre you his sounding board? Not alone. There are many people who make up the sound.\n\nShe's not the only sounding, but I try a lot of material out on on Liza. But are you honest?\n\nIf you're not feeling something he's going to include. Oh, God.\n\nYeah. No, we had a joke, which I won't repeat, but are you sure you can?\n\nIt's a safe space here. No, no, no, I don't trust you. I don't trust any of you.\n\nUh, but, um, Liza was like, nah, I don't think that's the right way to go. And she was right, and she was right.\n\nAnd it was a joke that the writers really liked. But we got I got rid of it because you\n\nweren't feeling it, and I'm really glad I did. Every writer's favorite way.\n\nNow tell me when you watch him, when he starts to present. Sorry.\n\nWhen he starts to host the Oscars, are you sat there thinking, come on, you can do it. You can do it.\n\nLike, are you a proud, never nervous. Wow. Not at all.\n\nWow. I have faith in him above pretty much anything else.\n\nWill you marry me? Absolutely. I'm a very homosexual man, but very welcoming\n\nin this relationship. It could be a throuple I would love. I've always wanted to be a throuple.\n\nAnd I love my husband. He's great, but he's okay in my life. He's all right.\n\nHe lives for my life. I want to just talk about your hair before we kiss you off.\n\nYeah. Your hair's not as high as it typically is. And I need you to know that I had very high\n\nhair. Also, you know it. It's the weather.\n\nOkay. And my hair is barometric. My hair is barometric.\n\nSo when the hair. When it's humid, when it's just right, it fluffs up, and then it can fall down\n\nsometimes. Conan, you. I don't know if you know, but I had a version\n\nof your hair, so I'm on a Netflix show, and people used to compare me to you constantly. I was the Brown Conan.\n\nYes. And then only a few months ago, I changed it. My question before you leave is, would you\n\never go for something a little different other than the quiff? I think it's too late.\n\nI did it. I went with this a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nAll right, all right. Well, on that, we'll let you go. Thank you so much for a lovely evening.\n\nCongratulations for tonight. That's amazing. And thanks for having us.\n\nLovely to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you everyone.\n\nNow we're going back to Hannah and Bedhead.\n\nThe best of me. I am newly in the Redhead Club. Yes.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Hi. It's nice here.\n\nI do have to say, I watched your documentary on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was so inspired. After that, I wanted I could take over the world.\n\nI'm so sorry. What was your inspiration behind this? Yeah, I just really wanted to give.\n\nLike, she's baring it all at Vanity Fair. Eco friendly. You're crushing.\n\nShe's definitely giving poison ivy. Yes, yes, yes. Green is crushing it.\n\nAnd I love a feather I freakin love. Look at that. The body is body.\n\nNo. It's body. Oh, my God, I'm obsessed.\n\nSo when you go in this party, are you dancing or are you just holding it tight? Posing.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. I'm standing still. I'm giving statue.\n\nI'm giving Oscar. I feel like they have to pay to, like, see you perform.\n\nI told you that was a different live stream. Yeah, yeah. Don't.\n\nDon't do that for free. That's crazy. I do it for the hotties everywhere, though.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, you do it for the girls. And we appreciate that.\n\nYeah. You give so much confidence to women everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not feeling confident? I start my day with you and only you.\n\nOh my God. I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.\n\nWe're lying. No I know. No.\n\nYour music has literally, like, made me want. When I want to fight someone. I listen to your music.\n\nYou want to throw that fighting out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad.\n\nWhen people are talking, I go turn on Megan. Body ody ody. I look beautiful.\n\nI look so great. Wait. No.\n\nYou look so good when you're. But I know because I watched your documentary.\n\nYou've been through so many dark things. How do you get yourself up and inspire people?\n\nI've never seen her this passionate. I just look in the mirror and I'll be like, damn you, that girl.\n\nYeah, right. Yeah, you are that girl. So go outside and act like you're that girl.\n\nNo, we love you. That's how I tackle my day. That I'm crying would be the one that made me\n\ncry. I'll take my pictures. Don't cry.\n\nCry. Do you cry a lot? I do cry.\n\nI'm a crier, I love that. What's your sign? I'm an Aquarius.\n\nOh, I don't cry much when I cry for a reason. Yes, you let it go. Well, keep, keep like letting it all into\n\nyour music. Never, never, never stop. I want to know.\n\nThat was so good. Come on girl. No.\n\nI know we've been staring yourself all the time. Meg, what are you wearing, though?\n\nWhen you're, like, just writing new music. What are you wearing? Big t shirt and panties.\n\nA big t shirt. Like, with stains on it and stuff. No.\n\nNo stains. Oh, sorry. That was me.\n\nLike the perfect big getting ready t shirt. No, just a plain white t shirt. Yeah, or like a graphic T or something.\n\nOne of my favorite celebrities on it or something. Okay.\n\nMy panties. Yeah, yeah, you are, as you should. Your thong.\n\nGranny thong. Always okay. Cheeks always out.\n\nCheeks out. Um, Meg, go in there. You've spent way too much time with us.\n\nWe love you so much. Somebody said they stole my place in line, I gotta go.\n\nOh, oh, oh, I think we should end every stream with cheeks. I'm joined by John Mulaney and Olivia Munn.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for being here. You've been part of iconic SNL moments.\n\nHow did it feel to be back for the 50th anniversary special? Are there any behind the scenes memories that\n\nyou're still laughing about? Um, there was a great pep talk in the cue card department before we started the three\n\nhour show, where they had stacks of cue cards about as high as me and Wally.\n\nThe cue card guy told everyone to just have fun. And everyone laughed because no one was\n\nreally going to have fun until the show was over. The show is over.\n\nYeah. That's great. And John, your Netflix talk show is coming\n\nback in a few weeks. If you could have any guest on the show, living or dead, who would be your dream to\n\ninterview and why? Oh, that's a good question. David Bowie would be my dream guest.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good one. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd between the two of you, who's more likely to end up leading the charge to the dance floor tonight.\n\nIt would be me. 100%. But everyone knows that on site.\n\nI love that. Thank you both so much. Have an amazing night.\n\nHave a great night. Nice to see you. Nice to see you.\n\nOh my goodness. We're live. We are live with the one and only Nate\n\nBargatze, who's changing the world for comedy right now.\n\nThey don't let most comedians in, especially stand ups, because most of us are dirty. Yeah.\n\nHow did you get into this event? You know, I got I got invited this year, I got invited, I feel I still have it.\n\nSo I feel like this is the gateway to the Oscars.

Pages.\n\nLose her mind here. Lost her mind. I won't make you spell it, but yeah.\n\nNo, it is a brooch. I saw a lot of people had them.

Trendsetters.\n\nThis is where it starts. At the bar. Do you ever.\n\nDo you ever come to these events and you're like, wow. I'm like one of the only comedians.\n\nDo you ever say a joke that just, like, doesn't land with all the respected actors? Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, if they don't know the context of, like, me being a comic, you can say something, especially a long story that can.\n\nOh, yeah. That's hard. Like, you will know when you know it's not\n\ngoing to hit even really hear you. You get out of it. They get their security and they're like, can\n\nyou get this guy? I'll wait till someone drags him off, and then I get back to them and go, let me finish\n\nwhat I was. Yeah. Let me get back into it.\n\nSo he golfs with some very famous people all the time.\n\nUm, do you have any advice for dealing with pressure on the golf course and on stage?\n\nBecause you're a calm man.

She never says that. And I never compliment a man.\n\nIt's against my religion. I really I can't do it. Oh, my velvet, the satin.\n\nOh, it's so good. I appreciate it. Brunello Cuccinelli, are you single?\n\nI'm not. I'm very married. Oh.\n\nMe too. Very happy. What?\n\nWhat do I not look like? I could trap a man.

This looks good.\n\nI love it. So, did you want the red or did your stylist force it on you?\n\nIt looks great. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, I don't know that.\n\nI thought about the pocket square, to be honest with you. The red is a nice pop, though.\n\nIt does look good. That's how you know. You didn't think about it.\n\nYou didn't even know he was wearing one. Alessio, over at Brunello and Jason Bolden, my stylist, they they they they conspired and\n\ncollabed and then they sent it to you. This whole thing. They said, hey, put this on.\n\nYou said, okay. And I said, okay. Yeah.\n\nHow many different glasses do you own?\n\nWe've all been wanting to know a lot. Yeah, I only take pictures in glasses. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n\nIt makes you look like you know something we don't know. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you preparing? It's like. It's like the English.\n\nIt's like. It's like my version of a British accent. Yes yes yes yes yes yes.\n\nWho sounds so clever and witty? Everything he says sound unprepared because we don't have accents.\n\nWait. My brother. Oh, that's my brother from another.\n\nHe's running over my guy. Come on. He's literally just jumped over Kylie Jenner.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. And now the men are hugging, and now the men are hugging.\n\nI thank you so much for coming out. Yeah. Thank you for stopping by.\n\nI'm not really sure why I came over here, but we don't. We're sorry.\n\nThree minutes of. You can yell at your publicist after because that's what she said.\n\nTraumatizing. And we get it. Three minutes that he'll never forget.\n\nThat's what she said. Get out of here. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.\n\nOh, get out of here with your pocket square. Oh my God. Wait.\n\nNow we're joined by the one and only Tinashe. Oh my God. A vision.\n\nA vision. No, do not apologize to us. This corset is insane.\n\nI think it's insane. No, it's the texture. The color, the fit.\n\nIt's gorgeous. I feel like my rib cage is, like, overlapping right now.\n\nI'm obsessed. Wait, you have a sexual energy I can. It's radiating off you.\n\nNot only on the carpet, but in your music. Have you always, like, had just been sexy?\n\nHonestly, I feel like music is a great outlet for me to, like, bring that sex appeal, that ego, that alter ego.\n\nHonestly, I feel like in my day to day life, I'm like very chill, very toned down. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like with my music, I feel like I can, like, walk, you know. So okay, you say like in your day to day,\n\nyou're toned down. So like, you're not going to the grocery store in this.\n\nUnfortunately not. What's your like normal day style. Like on sweatpants?\n\nYeah. Sweatpants. Hoodie.\n\nYeah. All the things. Like the comfiest clothes, no bra.\n\nYeah. So do you like getting dressed up for stuff like this, or are you, like, my feet hurt?\n\nI mean, it's nice. It's nice to be able to, like, have the range.\n\nYeah, the range to do both. Get a girl who can do both. Who do you like better?\n\nMusicians or actors? I thought you were gonna say me or you. And I was like, please answer.\n\nWe're live.\n\nWe are not going to tell anyone. We won't tell. I honestly, I actors are kind of chill, I\n\nlike them. Yeah. I do have to say.\n\nYeah. Musicians, some of them are a little. They are larger than life at times.\n\nYou have a lot of feelings they can be. I was going to say they can be quite emotional.\n\nOh my God, I dated one. He cried so much, but it was my fault. Yeah.\n\nWhen you go in there, what's your vibe? Are you a wallflower? Are you dancing?\n\nI'm going straight for the champagne. Yes. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.\n\nYes. Where I should be? Yes.\n\nJust bopping and grooving. I love it so much. Are you going to ask for a selfie from\n\nanyone? Or is that like, oh my gosh, I am so not the ask for selfies type.\n\nYeah, neither are we. Like in the bathroom in there. Are you ever just like, oh, and that's\n\nKendall Jenner chill. I'm like, oh my God, I've seen you all. You're all friends.\n\nYou're like, does anyone want a tampon? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n\nYou're like, everyone's a human inside. I'm like, oh my God. But you know, keep it chill.\n\nYeah. You always look so good with your fists. Are you very opinionated with your stylist?\n\nLike, I want to wear this. Yes, definitely. You have to be girl.\n\nYou have to be especially. I feel like once you've done a couple of carpets and you come out looking crazy.\n\nYeah, you know that you can't do that anymore. And you have to be kind of decisive.\n\nWell, you crushed it tonight. You truly did. We loved you so much.\n\nLook so beautiful. Thank you so much. So much fun in there.\n\nAnd we love your freckles. Yes. You could not be cuter.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Have fun and.\n\nYeah. Have fun. Get out of here.\n\nThank you so much for being here. Um, John, we've seen you at a few Vanity Fair parties.\n\nAre there any standout moments that still make you laugh when you think about them? I was here for the slap.\n\nWe were here for the slap. We were here for the mix up. The La La Land mix up.\n\nSo yeah, there's been quite a few standout moments in the bathroom during this lap. Yes, I was in the in the bathroom for both of\n\nthose, but I saw the aftermath. Yes, Ron Howard gave us the play by play. Never go to the bathroom at the end of the\n\nshow. It's going to. It's going to come back to haunt you.\n\nYeah. Oh my gosh, that's wild. Um, and you've both done drama and comedy.\n\nIf you could swap roles with one of your characters for a day, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, jeez. I mean, I don't think I'd want to swap characters, swap places with Don Draper.\n\nThat'd be a real bummer. Um, but I don't know, maybe. Maybe the guy in in Top Gun.\n\nThat'd be pretty fun. Run an aircraft carrier or something?\n\nI have to say, my character from Mad Men, because that would be great.\n\nThat's a good one to be in 1970. In Big sur. So it sounds like a fun time.\n\nYes. Thank you guys so much for being here. Have an amazing night.\n\nYou look. You look amazing. Thank you.\n\nYes. Beautiful color. I am now joined by the hottest couple in\n\ntown. Actually, in the world. We have dove, Cameron and Damiano.\n\nHello, guys. How are you? We're so good.\n\nHow are you? Very well. Thanks.\n\nQuestion. Did we plan the outfits together? Did we want to coordinate?\n\nYes. I knew I was going to be all black. And he.\n\nHe had a secret wish for me also to be all black. Do you typically get to decide first?\n\nI had a fever dream. I came to her and I was like, I want to be like the Beckhams.\n\nWow. So that we're we're working on it. That's a really good inspo.\n\nThat's a wonderful inspo. Now we off camera, we were talking about this and I just want to hit it real hard.\n\nYour style evolution, you were always great, but you were grungier and now you're going for a lot more classic.\n\nWhat was the what was the the impetus for this?\n\nUh, it looks like we are a new band, but we've been actually doing it for quite a lot, and I just need.\n\nI just felt like I needed something different and I needed to be more focused on, like, what I really want to do.\n\nIt's so chic. It's almost like 50s inspired that you're that you're rocking now.\n\nI love it so much, dove. I know we all know what a rock star you are, but is it awkward when you're, like, at a\n\nconcert and everyone's going nuts for this one? No, not at all.\n\nI'm usually the one going the most nuts. I listen, I'm just as obsessed, so I totally get it.\n\nI can listen, I would love to really talk to you, dove, but it's really hard to look at. If you could see close up what I'm seeing,\n\nit's so difficult to look at her. Brown people don't blush easily. But under my skin.\n\nYou are a knockout. Me knockout. It's fine.\n\nI'm a very gay man. He's perfectly safe. I've never dabbled in that.\n\nRight. Do you know Teyana Taylor, by any chance? Yes.\n\nYou're absolutely beautiful. Hi. Come say hi.\n\nJoin us. Hi, love. Hi.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you guys. I'm gonna let you guys go. Thank you for joining me.\n\nIt was so good to meet you both. Can I get one mic? Yes.\n\nLovely to see you guys, darling. Hello, darling. How are you?\n\nOkay, I'm going to help you talk. Talk to me about this number.\n\nHold on. What's going on? I see some needle and thread.\n\nOh, no. Okay, listen. In the car.\n\nI'm gonna. I'm gonna do this. Oh, damn.\n\nThe back's even better. Are you willing to show the back?\n\nYou guys, can we see that on camera, please? Damn.\n\nHave you seen that? Okay. Who are we wearing?\n\nLaquan smith. Oh, we love Laquan Smith. Is this custom?\n\nYes, it is runway. Okay. Question.\n\nYou've been to this event many times. Yes. Are you still intimidated by that?\n\nYes I am. See, I'm, like, nervous right now. I'm so shy and people don't know that I don't\n\nbelieve in Red Carpet. I'm trying to practice how I'm going to post up, like, okay, do I stand like this?\n\nDo I? Okay, here's the problem. So I practice my poses in the mirror.\n\nAnd then as soon as I get onto the red carpet and they're shouting, you forget it all. They'll be like, can you stand right here?\n\nI'll be like, okay, I know. And you look back thinking, that was one of my poses, man, it's a dirty game.\n\nWhy do we work on right now? You acted last year or the year before?\n\nLast year. Okay. Are we working on a new movie?\n\nWorking on a new project. Are we focusing on music?\n\nEverything. Yeah, I actually have three movies coming this year.\n\nAnd a show with Ryan Murphy I'm very, very excited about. Where are you finding the time?\n\nOh, baby, I don't even know. You're working every hour that God sends. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, literally filming multiple things at once. And.\n\nAre you recording my music? Um.\n\nStay tuned. Let's see. That's a yes.\n\nThat's a yes, folks. We know how to read through that. Thank you so much.\n\nOkay, read the carpet. I'm gonna to try and get too many secrets out if I don't let her go.\n\nSo, Tiana, I'm gonna kiss you off for now. You look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nThe incomparable Tiana.\n\nWe are so excited to be here with Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nWhat up? Okay, I can't drive. I don't have my driver's license.\n\nAn interview question, am I right? Do you have any advice for looking cool when driving?\n\nUh, do it right. Don't like hit people and stuff? Yeah, don't hit people.\n\nKeep your eye on the road. Keep your emotions to yourself.\n\nWell, we just found out she's from Jersey, so. And they learned that in Jersey to keep their\n\nemotions to themselves. I'm super stoked. You know, we got a Jersey boy as a winner for\n\nbest picture today. Yes. No.\n\nThat's so exciting. I love new Jersey I love Sean Baker, he's awesome.\n\nYes. Represent Sean so good. And how do you think the accents were?\n\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn too, and I thought they nailed it. It was pretty intense.\n\nYeah, yeah I he has a he has a tendency to pick like real, real people for the role. And then, you know, they always just come to\n\nthe table with great performances. I think every film that he's ever directed, he's just really he just knows how to capture\n\ntruth. You know what I mean? And you can feel it when you watch any of his\n\nfilms. So yeah, I'm super happy for him. Yes.\n\nShout out to Sean and Michelle. You've taken on so many badass female roles. Is there something you look for in particular\n\nwhen you're, like, reading scripts? Yeah. You know, because.\n\nBecause of the last name. Yeah. And because I'm a woman I've always had to\n\nbattle for the last 25 years. Cartels. Hookers.\n\nUm, maids. Anything that's poverty porn.\n\nSo I stay away from all that stuff. I basically, you know, I don't like to, uh, representation matters.\n\nIt really does. Well, what you're saying, what you're doing with your presence, I think matters.\n\nYou know, if I were, like, if everybody were doing, you know, amazing work and we had lots of representation.\n\nI could probably be an actress and not so much an activist, but for the last, you know, 25 years that's been pretty much my you're\n\nvery purposeful with the roles you take, for sure. I kind of have to be because nobody, you\n\nknow, there's not a lot of people doing it. So you got to kind of like, and you do not want to be just.\n\nYeah, squared into one place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nNo. And speaking of not boring. No, we have to talk about your fashion\n\nbecause the cape. I'm obsessed. It's so powerful.\n\nAnd I love that. It's, like, tight and then, like, flaring out a little.\n\nAnd this is the color of the season. You're so on trend. Yeah.\n\nHow did you pick this? Was it between a couple or. You know Hugo is amazing.\n\nAnd he's he's the fantastic genius behind it all.\n\nBecause you know me, I'm such a tomboy. No, you wouldn't know it in this dress. You wouldn't know it.\n\nGorgeous. Is there a story behind this necklace? Because it's cool.\n\nYeah. Um. So, um, Basically, I get this jewelry from\n\nthis Polish designer who 3D prints everything. Wait.\n\nSo cool. Macabre. And so I have all of his jewelry remade in\n\ngold and silver. Wow. A true Jersey girl.\n\nA jersey figuring it out. Michelle, keep rocking it.

Yeah, basically, babies are in bed.\n\nI get it. It really is what it is. Like.\n\nYou put your kids to bed and you're like, now it's our time. What do Mom and dad do on a night off other\n\nthan this? Oh, well, we have too much fun.\n\nNever too much, I'm sure. We love our good date nights. We love a good meal.\n\nThat's like my love language. I love good food, but can you go out or do you have people in?\n\nWe go out. Yeah we do. We do a date night every Friday.\n\nSo we make sure that we spend that quality time, which is good, especially when she's looking like this and wearing this kind of\n\ndress. Listen, I have been a gay man my entire life, but Sierra is one of the very few people on\n\nthis planet I've seen thinking, what is it about this lady that's doing something to my heart?\n\nI don't know. Since I was a kid, you've been. Oh, just phenomenal.\n\nCan you talk about what's going on in your life right now when it comes to work? Oh my gosh, so much.\n\nI'm excited.

Of course she plays.\n\nYou loved her music ever since. One, two step and goodies. Don't get me started.\n\nI think that we just have a great time just to be able to raise kids and do this. And obviously we're also getting the\n\nproduction space too, with new productions. And so we're getting going. We're excited about some things we have going\n\non.

I was.\n\nAnd we were talking about. She loves comedians and comedy. I think you're going to have a stand up\n\nspecial soon. Absolutely not. That's why I'm friends with stand up\n\ncomedians, because they make me funnier. I was in bottom. You were incredible.\n\nI was in bottoms. Okay. I feel like people ask you this all the time,\n\nbut modeling or acting, you got to pick one. What are we doing? I couldn't possibly do that.\n\nThe thing is, you. All your actors are in campaigns, so, you know, you don't have to choose one.\n\nWow. She's right. All your favorite actors are on billboards.\n\nYou're right. You don't ever have to pick one thing. Being multi-hyphenate.\n\nUm, Kia. Thank you for having me. I can't believe, Colman.\n\nThank you for coming. That was amazing. That was pretty cool.\n\nThank you, thank you. Get out of here. A microphone.\n\nNo one should ever do that. Oh, we'll take it. Yeah.\n\nAll right, so here with me is Kathryn Hahn. Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nUm, do you have any group text chats still going from any of your projects? Oh, yeah, a bunch.\n\nI have one from Glass Onion that we still talk all the time. All of them.\n\nI think Edward is up for an award tonight. We're all very excited for him and for everyone.\n\nI have one for the studio. I think he just wants to talk to you about it.\n\nYeah. And, um. Uh, one for Agatha.\n\nYeah. I love a group chat after it's gone. I get very sad when something's over, so it\n\nmakes me happy to continue on with the group. It's like a family. Yes.\n\nIt is. Oh. That's amazing.\n\nAnd have you ever been to this party before? A few times, but it's every time as overwhelming as the time before.\n\nOkay. Just by the sheer amount of star wattage.\n\nYeah. It's true. It's true.\n\nConsolidated into one place. Yeah. It's overwhelming.\n\nI remember the first time I was like, I couldn't even make eye contact because it was too much in one room.\n\nIt's true. No, I know that's how I'm feeling. Yeah.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself, but. Well, good luck and thank you. And thank you so much.\n\nPain gowns. I know we're matching. We're matching this evening.\n\nYou look fabulous. It's so nice to meet you. You too.\n\nThank you for the link between us. Guys, welcome to our new home. It's.\n\nYeah, this is our new sitcom, and it's. We're all married. Straight to series.\n\nSisters from another Mister. Hello. We are so excited to be here.\n\nI just want to say, Bowen and you as well. Did you guys just fly here from a second ago?\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift. Yeah. Jet lag is a construct, a construct.\n\nHonestly, it's for mentally weak people. He got on a 6 a.m.. What is it, 6 a.m.?\n\nFlight to land. JetBlue. You're welcome.\n\nBecause you're a man of the people. I'm a man of the people. My carbon footprint is going to be\n\ndistributed evenly. Yes. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. It's important. Congrats.\n\nLast night was amazing. You two have incredible chemistry. Yeah.\n\nHow long? Now. Come on.\n\nHave you guys actually been friends? Like for real? The year 2008 and then 2009, you had a big\n\nfight when Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj came out.\n\nThat's when that's important. We really. That's your anniversary.\n\nYou're both off book on the same Nicki Minaj songs. And then it was like, okay, because our\n\nfriends were like, I was in the sketch group. He was in the improv group. We were both gay and they were like, be\n\nfriends. We're like, no, we're not going to be friends just cause we're gay.\n\nAnd then we were friends just for two. They're amazing. Podcast.\n\nI feel like, how the hell have we not met before? Have you been?\n\nI know, I know, it's rude. Okay, this is the scoop. We've been trying to get y'all on the podcast\n\nfor ages. No, no, we're coming tomorrow. We're coming, we're coming on it.\n\nWe're coming tonight. Yeah. This is a podcast.\n\nThis is the podcast. Record it actually. Yes.\n\nMe and Matt have hung out before. We've got. We've been in bed.\n\nIt's crazy. We've gotten in bed. I haven't even gotten a Snapchat.\n\nI haven't gotten anything in these streets. So you guys, when you go in there, do you approach people or just vibe alone?\n\nIt depends. We get a little brave. Like he had to convince me to go up to\n\nSebastian Stan number one talent crush. It was amazing. No, I need to go up to Sebastian Stan.\n\nI'm obsessed. Jawline. Look at us talking.\n\nWe forgot we're in. We're actually we're. This is a job we have to do.\n\nWe literally forgot when you guys go in there, we you when you guys go in there, do you separate like, do you break and then come\n\nback? No, no, I'm, I'm glomming on to this one. Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah. Who's more outgoing? It depends on the context.\n\nYou guys are both quite shy.\n\nYeah. You're kind of. You give wallflower.\n\nWait. Have you guys ever hooked up accidentally? No.\n\nNever. No. We keep it.\n\nWe're sisters. Us neither. But like, the night is young.\n\nYou got to talk to this. We're at Vanity Fair. You want to hook up with Amelia?\n\nI love how he's like. Please stop talking to us. No, no, no, we've been eating up so much\n\nairtime. You have to talk to her. No.\n\nAmelia, come. Hello. It's a literal party.\n\nOh, my God, all these funny hot people. I know it's too many. Too many hot, too many hot funny people.\n\nOh, we're getting there. We love you. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGood luck on your pictures. Good luck. I have to let you guys know.\n\nAmelia Dimoldenberg. And I love how they put how to pronounce my name.\n\nDemi Moore. And let's be honest, everyone, everyone says Amelia Demi Moore.\n\nAnd you know exactly who we're talking about. It's Amelia. Dims.\n\nAmelia dims. We went up to you two days ago and said, do you have any advice for the carpet?\n\nYeah. Can I tell you I was very starstruck meeting you the other night.\n\nI'm just very. Is that why I thought you were shy? I am shy, but I'm just very impressed by you.\n\nI was watching you on the television yesterday when I was trying to prep, and I was trying to relax, and you were just on\n\nBravo, and I was like, oh, my God, there you are. You relaxed.\n\nDid it relax you? Absolutely relaxed. Me.\n\nNothing like really hot, funny people in a house to relax me.\n\nNo. Amelia. How does it feel to be interviewed?\n\nYeah, guys, I feel like I'm like, I just had a tequila shot.\n\nI'm feeling. Where is everyone getting the tequila? Yeah.\n\nNo one's offered us over to us. I feel like. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, but then, anyway, um, it feels great to be interviewed, actually, because it's a\n\nbit of a switch to me doing all the questions.\n\nCan I call it out, though? Amelia obviously crushing it in comedy. A journalistic icon, but fashion wise,\n\nyes, it's next level. I'm screenshotting all her looks. This is gorgeous.\n\nGuys, this has, like, texture to it. Yeah, I feel like they're not getting the vibe.\n\nYeah, it actually feels good. It's almost like an animal. It's giving the British JLo I said it.\n\nWait, what? I said. And now we've said it.\n\nObsessed. And now we've said it. Obsessed.\n\nI just said it. Okay. Obsessed.\n\nNow my head's gonna explode. Wait, how? How are you guys?\n\nSee? She's turning it. Turning it?\n\nNo one. No one's asked that yet. No one's asked us.\n\nAnd we haven't. We don't really like reflecting on our own feelings because then we get into a dark\n\nplace. It's true. But I feel like you're killing it.\n\nWe're trying our best, and we haven't looked at the comments yet. We'll find out soon.\n\nDon't read the comments. Our team is going like this constantly. Keep going.\n\nAmelia. Get in there and we'll ",

        "content": "The 29-year-old singer first rose to fame in 2016 as a member of the K-Pop sensation, Blackpink. An instant fan favorite, she struck out on her own two years later and, in 2019, was named an official Chanel ambassador by the late Karl Lagerfeld. Jennie’s superstardom was so evident that she soon became known as Korea’s “sell-out queen”—in a good way. Anything Jennie touches, wears, or holds will likely sell out instantly, no matter the price tag.\n\nUsually, in early March, you’ll find Jennie in Paris at fittings ahead of Chanel’s fall ready-to-wear show. But this season was different. For the first time during her ambassadorship, rather than sitting in the front row at the Grand Palais, she’s in New York City. “It feels weird for sure,” she says, settling into the green room. “It’s the first show in a very long time I’ll be missing.” The trade-off, though, marks a major moment in her career. “There [are] so many emotions, but getting to hold my first show for the first time in LA meant so much to me,” she says. “I spent a lot of time out there working on this album, so it was really special. And it was my first theater show.” Though Jennie is used to performing in sold-out stadiums and headlining music festivals, she admits that she gets just as nervous in front of smaller audiences. That’s where her pre-show rituals come in.",

(It’s called Miss Austen, and stars Patsy Ferran—who is presently appearing as Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire at BAM!—as Jane.)\n\n13. For a second I thought that the man playing Mr. Bingley was Eddie Redmayne, but it’s actually Simon Woods…who is Christopher Bailey’s husband?\n\n14. Also, Simon and Rosamund dated when they were at Oxford together?! And after doing this movie, Rosamund ended up dating (and becoming engaged to!) Joe Wright?!!\n\n15. Anyway, back to the movie again! Mr. Darcy is looking very dour and unimpressed by the Bennetts.\n\n16. Lydia and Kitty learn that “the regiment are coming” and are in hysterics. (“Officers! As far as the eye can see!”)\n\n17. Asked by Elizabeth if he dances, Mr. Darcy’s response is “not if I can help it.” Hahaha.\n\n18. Oh, God, Elizabeth hears Mr. Darcy refer to her as “not handsome enough to tempt” him. Dumb!\n\n19. Darcy and Elizabeth have a weird little fight about whether poetry encourages or kills attraction. This ends with Elizabeth slyly indicating that she heard the mean thing Darcy said about her. >:)\n\n20. Elizabeth and Jane are very sweetly whispering under the covers. I wonder how this kind of thing is filmed?\n\n21. The following morning, as Mrs. Bennett recaps the night, Mr. Bennett is very wearily like, “We were all there, dear.” I am laughing!\n\n22. Anyway, she just wants the best for all five of her unmarried girls!!\n\n23. Jane’s been invited to dine with…just Mr. Bingley’s sister, Caroline? Everyone’s confused.\n\n24. Mrs. Bennett is crazy. She has Jane go to the Bingleys’ place on horseback instead of via carriage because she knows it’s going to rain, and they (the Bingleys) will feel obliged to have Jane stay over. As Mr. Bennett puts it, “Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art of matchmaking are positively occult.”\n\n25. The rain makes Jane ill, of course, so she ends up having to stay there longer than planned.\n\n26. Caroline is making fun of Elizabeth for having walked to their house. Whatever!\n\n27. Darcy is being snobby about what it means for a woman to be “accomplished”...but he likes a reader and Elizabeth, as we well know, is that!",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Worried you’re not getting enough protein? For years, I didn’t. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I thought that if I ate too much protein and worked out, I would become bulky—like those muscle men who slam weights around in the gym. It also didn’t help that I grew up in the 2000s, when cereal and granola bars were considered “health food.” Hungry in the middle of the morning? Just have some Special K!\n\nIt’s no wonder I had a bad relationship with food—I ate little more for breakfast than a bowl of fruit. I had cravings all the time, felt exhausted, and experienced mental lapses. And, for the record, my muscles were basically non-existent.\n\nOf course, I’m not alone—many people don’t consume enough protein. In fact, many people do not even include it in the first meal of the day. “For example, in Spain, we eat pan con tomate—bread with tomato—for breakfast and do not add protein,” notes nutrition expert Mariana Sánchez Díaz.\n\nThese days, however, we are getting wise to the fact that getting adequate protein is not just necessary—it is vital for women as we age. It’s also especially important to get it in the morning: Studies show that eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast can prevent fatigue and cravings between meals. “Eggs, Greek yogurt, or rich protein sources such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna help control appetite throughout the day while supporting a faster metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving cognitive function,” explains nutritionist and biologist Anastasiia Kaliga of the holistic wellness app Luvly.\n\nAt the very least, experts say 10% of our daily calories should come from protein. To figure that out in grams, just multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36—the result is the minimum amount of protein in grams you should aim for each day.\n\nSigns you’re not getting enough protein\n\nWhen I finally realized that I wasn’t getting enough protein for my body to function properly, it was because my menstrual cycle became irregular. (Turns out protein is important for hormones, too.)\n\nMissing periods, experts say, is just one sign you may not be getting enough protein. Other symptoms? Swelling in the hands and feet, getting sick frequently, feeling depressed, or having wounds that are slow to heal. Below, nutritionists share a few more signs of not getting enough protein.\n\nFatigue\n\n“In extreme cases, you can be tired and lack energy,” explains nutritionist Mariana Pérez-Trejo Soltwedel. “After all, consuming balanced meals—including protein—is key to keeping the immune system functioning and for regulating your hormones.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "This Saturday, March 29, Vogue and Gigi Hadid are hosting a one-day-only vintage shopping extravaganza in New York City, with 100% of the proceeds going towards those impacted by the Los Angeles fires. The sale will be filled with iconic pieces courtesy of some of our most fashionable friends—a 2010 Prada dress from Lauren Santo Domingo, Kendall Jenner’s circa 2004 Dior logo’d mini-skirt and fanny pack, and a few select pieces from Vogue contributor and fashion icon Lynn Yaeger, including a tutu, a “little velvet evening bag from the 1920s,” and an aviator hat.\n\nOn this week’s episode of The Run-Through: Baby Lynnie, as she’s affectionately known, joins Nicole Phelps and Vogue’s Fashion Features Director Mark Holgate for an episode dedicated to all things vintage shopping. “I guess at some point in my 20s, I decided that I really looked good in 1920s clothes and I was only going to wear 1920s clothes,” Yaeger recalls about the origins of her signature style, which Holgate describes as “an incredibly individualistic look” that fuses “tutus, a slightly ’20s and ’30s air and attitude of clothing, mixed with Comme des Garçons, Simone Rocha, and Molly Goddard.”\n\nThe long-time colleagues discuss their all-time favorite vintage haunts, playing hooky from work to scour markets abroad, and the ways they’ve seen the industry adopt and adapt to the world’s fascination with vintage shopping—including how the furor for it has now jacked up prices. “I’m always taken aback, but it’s still much more reasonable than [buying] new things,” Yaeger explains. She may be price conscious, but she does make exceptions. “It’s like a love affair, you know everything goes out the window when something is speaking to you.” Listen to the episode for more of Lynn’s real vintage talk, including what she won’t do for one-dollar dresses.",

        "title": "The Best Sources of Protein for Vegetarians, According to Experts",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "One of the biggest misconceptions of a vegetarian diet is that it lacks protein. But just because you’re not eating meat doesn’t mean you lack access to such a crucial part of proper nutrition.\n\n“It is a myth that vegetarian diets are inadequate in protein and amino acids,” says Katrina Hartog, MPH, RD, CDN, director of clinical nutrition at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West. “The terms complete and incomplete proteins have historically been used to describe plant-based proteins based on the amino acid profile, but it’s misleading. The amino acid profile is less optimal in plant-based proteins compared to animal-based proteins, but they still contain all 20 amino acids.”\n\nProtein intake is essential for everyone’s health. As nutritionist and health psychologist Karishma Shah explains it, proteins are the building block of life. “Every cell in the human body contains protein,” Shah says. “The basic structure of protein is a chain of amino acids and we need it in our diet to help our body repair cells, and build muscles and tissues to our bones, skin, and hair.\n\nWhen you lack protein in your diet, Hartog says that it can lead to many health problems, such as stunted growth, anemia, physical weakness, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, cardiac failure, hair breakage, and impaired immunity. So to prove just how much protein options there are for vegetarians out there and how to incorporate them into a healthy diet, Hartog and Shah break down everything we need to know, see what they had to say below.\n\nHow Much Protein Should You Eat?\n\nHartog says that the amount of protein you should be eating is determined by a couple of different factors: your body size, your muscle mass, and how physically active you are. She points to the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA), which suggests you eat about 0.8 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. By that metric, someone who weighs about 165 pounds, for example, should eat 60 grams of protein per day. For a vegetarian who weighs about 165 pounds, daily protein can look like one cup of tofu (which contains 24 grams of protein), one cup of cooked lentils (which contains 18 grams of protein), and half a cup of oats (which contains 5 grams of protein).\n\nThis is the standard protein amount everyone should aim for, regardless if you eat meat or not. But it is also just a general guideline and you can adjust how you see fit, within reason. She points to recent studies that show those eating about 1.0 grams of protein can benefit from muscle preservation and greater strength when exercising. Shah doesn’t believe in going overboard with the protein if that’s the case, though. She says that many athletes and frequent gym goers think they need to drastically increase their protein intake to manage their body and build more muscles. Too much of it can have adverse effects as it can cause excess fat in the body, so find a happy medium.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Katie Holmes just gave a masterclass in elevating the little black dress. Last night, the actor—who recently starred in Our Town on Broadway—attended the opening night of Othello in a black strapless column dress that fell to her ankles. While the LBD from Khaite was already compelling thanks to a satin bustier peeking out from underneath the crepe body, accessories added some pizzaz to the classic look.\n\nHolmes carrried a snakeskin shoulder bag (also Khaite) in the ultra-trendy East-West silhouette. But what really set her LBD apart was the addition of a freaky lil’ shoe. She wore a pair of Khaite Bella T-strap sandals complete with an ankle strap, a nearly-2-inch heel, and—most freakily of all—a covered pointy toe, like a reverse shoe mullet. (Between Khaite and Tory Burch, the subverted toe is already a growing trend among the freaky shoe lovers.)\n\nDiamond / BACKGRIDUSA\n\nThe following day, Holmes once again trotted out a pair of eye-catching footwear. The actor hit the rainy New York City streets not in rain boots, but a pair of gathered black leather Jil Sander ballet flats. The glove-like shoe clung to Holmes’s feet and featured a pull-on tab on the heel. The entire look had all the trappings of a typical Katie Holmes ’fit: she styled the funky shoes with cropped patchwork jeans, a printed blouse, a calf-length brown jacket, and multiple tote bags.\n\nWhether she’s red carpet ready or running errands, Katie Holmes proves that the outlandish shoe works for any occasion.",

        "content": "They always say, the best retinol serum is one you’ll actually use. (That’s actually the saying most reserved for facial sunscreens, but it’s a similar sentiment.) One that feels great on the skin, sandwiches well with other products, and features a retinol concentration that your skin can tolerate based on your experience, or lack thereof, with retinoids.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Retinol Products\n\nThese days, the benefits of retinol are well-known—whether you use one or not. “Retinol is a powerhouse when it comes to achieving visible results,” board-certified dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bowe tells Vogue. “It brightens skin tone, helps clear acne, and boosts skin’s collagen production to address fine lines and wrinkles.”\n\nI can attest to these results. Even as a beauty editor who is constantly slathering products on my skin, I have not seen any ingredient improve the tone and texture like the best retinol serums and creams. It was the pandemic when I finally had enough time at home to take my skin-care routine seriously that I signed up for an online prescription service and was recommended a tretinoin cream—my first skin prescription since my hormonal, teenage acne days. Looking back, I didn’t even know I was being prescribed a form of retinol. Turns out, there are many forms of retinol to know; and we get it, this is understandably overwhelming. First used in over-the-counter creams in the ’70s, this potent form of vitamin A is prized for its proven youth-enhancing results. Read on to discover Vogue's guide to retinol treatments—from how to incorporate it into your regimen to the best products to use based on your skin type.\n\nIn This Story\n\nBest Retinol Cream: SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.3",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "This is a conclusion that most people in the party have come to, but what was interesting about Nancy Mace was that she literally said that out loud. She was like, “I can’t move up and be anti-Trump. I have some really tough decisions to make.” That’s a direct quote from the book. And just to hear someone actually say that was kind of interesting. If you want to rise in this political moment as a Republican, there’s only one decision to make, which is to go all-in with Trump, which is exactly what she’s done. She’s become a real extremist. I actually wrote a profile of her for the New York Times a few years ago, about how she’s a moderate trying to carve out a space for herself. People are mad at me that I ever fell for it, but I didn’t, I don’t think. I think she really just changed completely in the hopes of staying powerful.\n\n[Rep.] Elise Stefanik kind of did the same thing, but she doesn’t like talking about it, whereas we were talking to Nancy Mace constantly mid-transition. And some of these Republicans take extreme MAGA views further than Trump does. Trump gave an interview where he kind of agreed that the trans stuff gets too much attention and he didn’t really want to talk about bathroom bans, but Nancy Mace is making an entire political career out of targeting the sole transgender member of Congress, Sarah McBride. Trump is not doing that; she is doing that. Some of these members really make MAGA their own, and even take it further in some cases.\n\nHow do you think political reporters need to adapt in order to accurately report on a MAGA-controlled Congress during the second Trump administration?\n\nOne dirty little secret of this world is that a lot of these people who claim to hate the “lamestream media” and all that actually crave the credibility that comes with being covered by the New York Times or CNN or any mainstream publication. They love attention from anybody, so they’re actually quite a chatty bunch, and they will talk to you and tell you what’s going on and participate in interviews. Someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, really has shifted and learned to play the inside game more so that she’s not actually that hard to report on, because she’ll tell you what’s going on in meetings. When there’s a lot of factions who hate each other, that creates great room for reporting, because they want to tell their side of the story. They think that if they don’t talk to you, the other side will. Everyone has an angle that they want to be the angle of your story. The challenge as a reporter is just to make sure you’re talking to everyone, so you know you’re not getting spun.",

        "title": "I Add Collagen To My Coffee Every Morning, Here Are All The Benefits",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "There was a time when pimping your coffee was the height of cool. The year? 2018. Wellness influencers? Thriving, largely unregulated, and backed by communities absorbed by fluorescent yellow turmeric lattes and butter-laden espressos. There were violet-colored butterfly pea milk lattes (that's not a MadLib, but a real drink) and pink ones filled with beetroot powder. It was a confusing, expensive time.\n\nThen, as quickly as it ballooned, the trend appeared to die off. Oat milk went into exile. Apple cider vinegar gained the top spot in influencer fridges and the thought of shoving a pat of butter into your Americano suddenly seemed ludicrous. So, when I tell you that there’s been one coffee addition that’s survived both the popularity and the purge, know that it’s a hard-won victory. It is, of course, collagen.\n\nFor years now, I’ve stirred collagen into my morning drink. Whether it’s coffee, matcha, or a morning smoothie, the powder gets added. I’ve done it so much that it’s become second nature, something naturopathic nutritionist and author of The Hormone Balance Handbook, Jessica Shand, says is a good thing. “Because collagen is a resilient protein and remains intact even when exposed to heat, I love to stir it into my morning coffee or into my matcha. Not only does it add a boost of amino acids, but it can potentially blunt the cortisol-inducing impact of the coffee, too.”\n\nWhat does collagen coffee do?\n\nBesides curbing the post-caffeine jitters, mixing collagen into your coffee has a myriad of benefits. “Collagen is the main structural protein for the body’s tissues and acts as the scaffolding or the ‘glue’,” Shand explains. “I like to visualize it as the stuff that holds us together—from the integrity of our skin to our muscles, bones, fingernails, hair, and even our intestinal walls. I often recommend it to clients who want to focus on healthy skin during perimenopause and menopause. This is when estrogen (the hormone responsible for skin elasticity and suppleness) naturally declines. It can also help with joint and muscle pains.”\n\nCan you taste the collagen in coffee?\n\nNo. Collagen (when unflavored) has no taste. There are flavored options, too, if that's more your vibe. If anything, it might be worth keeping textural issues in mind. Depending on how much collagen you add to a hot drink, you need to stir or froth for a minute or two to break up any clumps. I use a battery-powered frother like this one to get mine fully mixed.\n\nDoes collagen count as protein?\n\nYes, says Shand, but not in the same way a fillet of salmon or other protein-rich food would. “Something like a chicken breast is primarily a source of lean protein while collagen powder is a concentrated source of collagen, a specific type of protein found in connective tissue.”\n\nIf you track your protein intake, consider the protein from collagen as bonus points rather than a primary protein. As it doesn’t contain all nine essential amino acids, it’ll support skin, joint, and muscle health but might not be best for muscle synthesis.\n\nHow to pick a high-quality collagen powder\n\nFinding a high-quality supplement can be difficult for someone without the time to decode every label and claim. Shand says there are a couple of words to look out for. “With marine collagen, look for ‘pure hydrolyzed collagen’ that’s sustainably caught. For bovine collagen (the most common type), look for ‘grass-fed’ to ensure that it’s free from hormones, antibiotics, and chemical exposure.”\n\nWhen it comes to vegan collagen, Shand says that it’s a good option for plant-based diets but doesn’t stack up nutritionally when compared to marine or bovine collagen. “Vegan collagen usually contains plant-derived ingredients that help to stimulate your body’s natural collagen production, like vitamin C.” Shop Vogue's favorite collagen supplements, below.",

Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella. I'm gonna start in the middle.\n\nWhy not?\n\nNow I'm going to put a little bit of parsley.\n\nNot one flake went on there.\n\nA little lemon and voila, that is my paella.\n\nWow. I'm getting hints of saffron.\n\nI'm getting hints of tomato. This is delicious.\n\nGood job me.\n\nIt's all working. It's all giving.\n\nIt's all serving.\n\nMy kitchen at home does not look like this.\n\nAnd it usually has around 10 dogs running around me,\n\neating everything that falls on the ground.\n\nIt's just been a really peaceful, enjoyable experience.\n\nI love limes. You know, and Dakota's like, I love limes.\n\nI would like to take this home in memory\n\nof that amazing video.\n\nThanks so much for watching. Bye.\n\nI have a nephew and I perform popular to him.\n\nHe fully giggles and laughs\n\nat me playing Elphaba and Glinda for him.\n\nHe loves the power of Elphaba.\n\nLike he can really...\n\nHe feels it, but Glinda makes him laugh.\n\n[upbeat bright music]",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Suddenly everything’s coming up solid gold in the fashion collector world. Whispers of Victorian lockets, heavyweight mid-century bracelets, and French tank rings are lining the wishlists of fashion insiders and savvy shoppers alike. It’s no wonder: In just one year, the price of one troy ounce of gold has risen to $3,000—up nearly $1,000 from 2024, and double the cost it was just four years ago.\n\nWith those record-breaking figures comes a new wave of people investing in chunky, heavy vintage and antique gold jewelry—plus rare, archival pieces coming to the market from older generations looking to sell given the current cost of gold. Enter a new slew of vintage and antique gold jewelry sellers on Instagram, with hoards of pieces that sell out instantly.\n\nCourtesy of Kim Limle\n\nKim Limle of EstateJewelryMama lists affordable pieces as well as jewelry from the Victorian era to the 1980s, which followers snap up on Instagram livestreams before Limle can even list them on her website. TalesFromTheJunkPile, launched by Ruby Casas, brings followers antique and vintage gold that otherwise would have been melted, for low price points via Instagram stories. It’s impossible not to notice the community of vintage gold sellers that has been fostered specifically on social media in the past year, with accounts like Oldgoldganster, Bhunicorn, Julzgoldx, Gildedlane, Thegoldbuglondon, and many others becoming go-tos over traditional jewelry shops. These days, for many vintage lovers, solid gold jewelry has surpassed the old guard of designer handbags as the de rigeur investment.\n\n“With the popularity of vintage and antique jewelry right now, customers are definitely appreciating pieces that are solid gold and less expensive than comparable new jewelry,” says Casas’s mother, Elisa, who runs the ChelseaGirl.NYC account alongside her daughter. The duo source pieces from gold scrappers in the New York City diamond district, rescuing everything from contemporary charms to historic pieces from the 19th century from being melted. “My mom and I are kind of the yin-yang when sorting in our junk piles,” says Ruby. “She’ll often first spot something antique and collectible, versus I’ll first spot a currently trendy piece millennials would die for. With that being said, when the other one picks it up, we don’t even have to speak, we can just shoot each other a look that says yes. They also curate pieces from dealers in Europe and provide competitive pricing based on the current gold market price. “One of my favorite parts of my job is selling items that I truly believe in, that hold real value, that are smart financial choices for our customers,” adds Ruby. “Gold is akin to dollars, just last week gold skyrocketed to the highest dollar per ounce in history. And the best part? They get to wear their investments!”",

        "content": "There’s always a sense of playfulness to Parker’s looks; You can tell she’s someone who loves dressing up as a form of self-expression, but doesn’t take it too seriously. At the New York City Ballet’s fall gala last year, Parker emerged in a metallic-silver floral gown by Oscar de la Renta. In her rule book, fashion should be fun. Even her more demure looks shine. She will sport a subdued black or gray skirt suit, but amp it up with sparkly heels or a Gucci It bag.\n\nAs fun as Parker’s red carpet looks are, they're often meaningful, too. Take her striking look at the 2022 Met Gala, which revolved around an American fashion theme: The star partnered with Christopher John Rogers on a full-skirted ball gown that paid homage to Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley, an unsung designer who made history as the first Black female fashion designer in the White House.\n\nSo, sure, Carrie Bradshaw may be forever associated with a serious penchant for style—but in our books, Parker is the real enduring fashion star here. And her wardrobe only seems to be getting better every year. The big question is: What fabulous ensembles will she break out in the year ahead? Judging by her chic history on the step and repeats, we know one thing for certain: They’ll be good.\n\nBelow, more of Parker’s recent fashion wins.",
