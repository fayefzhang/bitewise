Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die as Boston was hit with a major blizzard. Read has denied the allegations and maintained her innocence.\n\nAt least four jurors who served on her first trial last year confirmed that she was found not guilty of second-degree murder and leaving a scene of personal injury and death, according to Read's attorneys.\n\nRead was also charged with manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty to all three charges.\n\nThis undated photograph provided by the Boston Police Department shows officer John O'Keefe, 46, of Canton, Mass. Boston Police Department via AP, FILE\n\nJury selection in the retrial begins on Tuesday. Jury selection could last weeks. Her first trial lasted more than two months, including deliberations, and drew widespread national coverage.\n\nIn a surprise twist this week, Read added one of the alternate jurors from her first trial to her legal team for the retrial. Victoria George, the alternate juror, is a licensed civil attorney in Massachusetts.\n\nLast August, a judge declined to dismiss the two charges in her retrial, saying no verdict was announced in court so she was not acquitted of any charges -- despite her attorneys' claim the jury found her not guilty in deliberations. Read filed several appeals to state and federal courts to get the charges dropped, without success.\n\nRead and O'Keefe met friends for drinks at a local sports bar before the storm and then went to another nearby bar, Read told ABC News.\n\nAround midnight, O'Keefe and some others elected to leave after they were invited to the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston police officer, she said.\n\nRead, who said she was tired, claims she dropped O'Keefe off outside Albert's residence and then drove her SUV to O'Keefe's house and fell asleep.\n\nIn this June 25, 2024, file photo, Brian Albert listens during closing arguments in the Karen Read trial at Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Mass. Nancy Lane/The Boston Herald via AP, FILE\n\nAlbert and others who attended the gathering at his home say that O'Keefe never went inside the home.\n\nRead said she awoke alone and anxiously called O'Keefe's friends to say he never came home.\n\nRead said she drove around Canton for 20 minutes before meeting up with two friends of O'Keefe -- Kerry Roberts and Jennifer McCabe, sister-in-law of Brian Albert -- and returning to O'Keefe's house thinking he may have made his way home.\n\nNot finding him at the house, the trio drove back to the home where Read said she dropped him off. They found his body lying motionless on the front snowbank, according to her.\n\nHe was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead that morning. An autopsy found that he died of hypothermia and blunt force injuries to the head.\n\nIn this Nov. 13, 2024, file photo, Karen Read and her defense team and the prosecution file motions in Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Mass. Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool, FILE\n\nProsecutors have alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in the middle of a snowstorm after the two got into an argument earlier that day.\n\nDamning testimony during Read's trial led to the suspension of Massachusetts State Police Officer Michael Proctor last July. Trial testimony revealed Proctor was communicating with Canton Police Officer Kevin Albert during the investigation ahead of Read's murder trial.\n\nAlbert is the brother of Brian Albert, who hosted the party at the house where O'Keefe's body was found outside.\n\nKevin Albert was also placed on administrative leave last July, according to Boston ABC affiliate WCVB.\n\nABC News' Meghan Mariani contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)\n\nBANGKOK -- Hooters, the U.S.-based restaurant chain known for chicken wings and “Hooters Girls” skimpy wait-staff outfits, has filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nHOA Restaurant Group filed the motion for Chapter 11 protection Monday in the North Texas Bankruptcy Court in Dallas.\n\nThe company ran into financial woes as its debts mounted, but it says it intends to stay open and resolve its troubles within months. A group of the company’s original founders that own almost a third of Hooters’ U.S. locations, including about half of its biggest volume restaurants, plans to buy and operate more of the outlets, Hooters said in a news release.\n\n“Our renowned Hooters restaurants are here to stay and we are taking action to strengthen our business to better serve our valued customers over the long term,” the company said in a notice on its website.\n\nHooters, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was founded in Clearwater, Florida, in 1983. Trouble had been brewing for a while.\n\nHooters had sponsored the No. 9 NASCAR car driven by Chase Elliott since 2017, but last year, Hendrick Motorsports ended its ties to the longtime sponsor because it was not meeting its financial commitments.\n\nIts business strategy has faced challenges over the years, including lawsuits over its hiring of only “Hooters Girls” to serve customers.\n\nLast year it agreed to pay $250,000 and provide other relief to settle a race and color discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against a Hooters outlet in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nIn 2022, the restaurant refuted claims it was shutting down and rebranding due to changing customer tastes.\n\nIn 2019, the Hooters hotel-casino off the Las Vegas Strip was sold to an Indian hotel company and rebranded as the OYO Hotel and Casino.\n\nIn 2017, the company tried opening a restaurant that didn’t feature wait-staff in tight tops, as a test of a different approach to its original concept.",

Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, speaks to supporters during a campaign stop at the American Serb Hall, March 29, 2025 in Milwaukee.\n\nVoters head to the polls on Tuesday in Wisconsin for a hot-button race that could offer a barometer on how Americans are feeling at this point in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nRepublican-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel and Democratic-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford are the candidates in Tuesday's marquee state Supreme Court race, which is technically nonpartisan -- but it has become the center of a political firestorm, as well as the target of millions spent by groups linked to tech billionaire and key Trump adviser Elon Musk.\n\nThe election will determine which of the candidates, vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal.\n\n\"This is playing out like a presidential-style election. You turn on your TV, any local broadcast station here across the state of Wisconsin, you are inundated with political-type ads for what is technically a nonpartisan judicial race, but this is a full-on political race … this is becoming a true litmus test for the first 100 days of the Trump administration,\" Matt Smith, political director at Milwaukee's ABC affiliate WISN-TV, told ABC News Live anchor Diane Macedo last week.\n\nThe winner of this race will join the bench as the court potentially grapples with key voter issues such as abortion access and redistricting. For example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.\n\nThe race could also preview how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into Trump's second term -- especially as Musk and his work with the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency becomes a key issue given his groups' investments in the race.\n\nElon Musk arrives for a town hall wearing a cheesehead hat at the KI Convention Center on March 30, 2025 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nMusk has indicated he is interested in the race because of the possibility that the court takes on redistricting cases -- which could impact the balance of power in the U.S. House if rulings cause congressional maps to be redrawn.\n\n\"That is why it is so significant, and whichever party controls the House, to a significant degree, controls the country which then steers the course of Western civilization,\" Musk said at a high-profile town hall on Sunday in Green Bay.\n\nMusk has implied \"the future of civilization\" is at stake with the race. On Sunday, the tech billionaire also controversially gave away two $1 million checks to attendees at a rally in his latest effort to support Schimel.\n\nSchimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general and a circuit court judge in Waukesha County. He has received almost $20 million in support (such as spending for TV ads) as of Monday from groups linked to Musk, per a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nSchimel has also received endorsements from Trump, Musk, Donald Trump, Jr., and other key conservative figures.\n\nSchimel has welcomed the conservative support, yet said at a rally last week that he would treat any case fairly, including if it was a case brought by Trump.\n\nHowever, Crawford and her allies have alleged he would not treat cases involving Trump or Musk fairly, and she has made Musk a main target of her campaign.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel, center, speaks with supporters as former Gov. Scott Walker, left, watches, March 31, 2025, in Madison, Wis. Scott Bauer/AP\n\nSchimel, asked on Thursday by ABC affiliate WISN to share his closing argument ahead of the final days in the race, said, \"My closing argument is that people need to take this race seriously. So much is at stake. We have to restore objectivity to this court right now ... We have to put the court back in its proper role where it's not making the law. It's not going through a political agenda. It is applying the law the way the legislature writes it, to the facts of the case.\"\n\nCrawford, backed by Democrats, is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. At points, she represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.\n\nMajor liberal donors such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic donor George Soros have given money to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford. The national Democratic Party has also invested in the race.\n\nCrawford told WISN that her closing argument was about an impartial court: \"It's about making sure that we have a Supreme Court that is fair and impartial in interpreting our laws to protect the rights of Wisconsinites. The other choice is an extreme partisan, someone who is selling out to special interests, has a long history of doing that, and has now tied himself to Elon Musk.\"\n\nDane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, speaks during a campaign stop, March 29, 2025, in Milwaukee. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of Monday, more than $90 million has been spent in the race -- making it the most expensive judicial election in the nation's history. That amount includes more than $49 million spent by Schimel or groups supporting him, and more than $40 million spent by Crawford or groups supporting her.\n\nThe nonprofit says that the previous record for spending in a state supreme court race was in Wisconsin's 2023 state supreme court election, when $56 million was spent.\n\nVoters have taken notice. One Wisconsinite who voted early told WISN, \"There's a lot of outside money coming in, in our state. And I wanted to make sure that my voice is being represented and not other people.\"\n\nAs of Monday, around 644,000 people in Wisconsin have voted early in person or by mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\nDane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, speaks to supporters during a campaign stop at the Waukesha County Democratic Party headquarters, March 29, 2025, in Waukesha, Wis.

Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nVoters in Wisconsin will also vote on a ballot initiative over whether to enshrine requiring a photo ID to vote into the state constitution. Voter ID is already required by state law; enshrining it into the state constitution would not establish new requirements, but would likely make it harder to ever undo the law.\n\nDemocratic groups and voting rights organizations have criticized the ballot initiative as potentially disenfranchising voters. Supporters of the initiative argue it will strengthen election security in Wisconsin and is cementing a requirement that has already been in place.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll taken in late February also found that a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin support photo ID for voting, and separately, a majority of registered voters in Wisconsin said they would support the ballot initiative.\n\nABC News' Rachel Scott, Ben Siegel, Will Steakin, Averi Harper, Hannah Demissie and Katherine Faulders contributed to this report.",

Both Kyiv and Moscow have since accused the other of violating the pause on energy attacks.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that its forces downed three Ukrainian drones overnight over the territory of its western Bryansk region. The ministry also alleged that Ukrainian drones targeted energy facilities twice over the previous 24 hours.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha also accused Russia of attacking energy infrastructure, telling journalists Monday that a strike on a facility in the southern Kherson region left 45,000 residents without power.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly cited Russia's near-nightly bombardments as evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no real interest in the ceasefire and peace being proposed by President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nIn a Sunday evening video address, Zelenskyy reported \"more strikes and shelling\" in seven Ukrainian regions. \"The geography and brutality of Russian strikes, not just occasionally, but literally every day and night, show that Putin couldn't care less about diplomacy,\" he said.\n\n\"For several weeks now, there has been a U.S. proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy added. \"And almost every day, in response to this proposal, there are Russian drones, bombs, artillery shelling and ballistic strikes.\"\n\nThis file photo shows a Ukrainian soldier standing on a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft cannon in the Sumy region near the Russian border on Aug. 17, 2024.

China and India are among the most significant customers for Russian oil products.\n\nThe president later told reporters on Air Force One that his administration was making significant progress toward ending the war. Asked about his relationship with Putin, Trump responded, \"I don't think he's going to go back on his word.\"\n\nAsked if there was a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump suggested there was a \"psychological deadline.\"\n\nHe added, \"If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it.\"",

The move marked the latest in an upsurge of recession fears on Wall Street in recent weeks.\n\nA policy of wide-ranging levies on foreign goods could tip the U.S. into a recession, experts said. They pointed to risks of a slowdown for businesses mired in higher tax costs, as well as a shopping slump as consumers curtail spending to pad their savings to help weather price increases and a possible economic downturn.\n\nThe degree and duration of Trump’s forthcoming tariffs remains unknown, experts added, but they pointed to such uncertainty as another reason the economy could fall into a recession.\n\n“If both businesses and consumers start to worry and pull back their spending, that is what can tip the U.S. over into a recession,” Kara Reynolds, an economist at American University, told ABC News.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described potential tariffs on April 2 as “the fodder for an economic downturn.”\n\nTrump has already announced a flurry of duties, including sector-specific tariffs targeting autos, steel and aluminum. The U.S. has also imposed levies on some goods from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump told reporters that the next round of tariffs could affect “all the countries.”\n\n\"The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely declined to rule out the possibility of a recession. Speaking at the White House earlier this month, Trump said a \"little disturbance\" may prove necessary to rejuvenate domestic production and reestablish well-paying manufacturing jobs.\n\nExperts generally define a recession by the shorthand metric of two consecutive quarters of decline in a nation’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP.\n\nTariffs could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad, some experts told ABC News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to members of the press while returning to Washington, DC on Air Force One on March 30, 2025, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nExperts widely expect importers to pass along a share of the tariff burden to consumers in the form of higher prices, which could make the firms less competitive as they may struggle to retain customers who suffer sticker shock.\n\nIf business performance suffers, firms will likely freeze or reduce investment, threatening economic growth.\n\n“As business investment goes down, that can trigger a recession,” Anne Villamil, a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, told ABC News.\n\nEven the looming risk of tariffs can make shoppers uneasy, potentially sinking the economy further, experts said.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. In March, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2021, according to a survey conducted by The Conference Board.\n\nAs consumer attitudes sour, shoppers could encounter tariff-induced price increases, leaving buyers even more frustrated.\n\n\"It's already showing up in consumer confidence,\" Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. \"There is chaos and uncertainty around the tariff policy.\"\n\nBy some key measures, however, the economy remains in solid shape. Hiring stands at robust levels alongside a historically low unemployment rate. Inflation sits well below a peak attained in 2022, though price increases register nearly a percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of 2%.\n\nVillamil, of the University of Iowa, acknowledged the strength of the economy in recent months. Still, she added, tariffs could plunge the U.S. into a downturn.\n\n\"The concern is that all of this policy uncertainty is putting the economy at risk,\" Villamil said.",

        "content": "The legislation could be \"life-changing\" for service members, Rep. Jacobs said.\n\nCongressional Democrats are renewing their push to expand in vitro fertilization access for military service members by introducing legislation that would require the Department of Defense's health care program to fund access to IVF for military service members.\n\nThe legislative effort, being led in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and in the House by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, would bring IVF access afforded to military service members in parity with the services available to members of Congress. It would also modify current requirements that service members prove that their infertility challenges are directly connected to service, a barrier that the lawmakers say is often cumbersome or impossible to overcome.\n\nIn vitro fertilization or IVF Peter Hansen/STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nThe legislation, Jacobs said in an exclusive interview with ABC News, could be \"life-changing\" for military service members who are often forced to choose between continuing their military service and starting a family.\n\n\"I think it will be huge. We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is, and are facing really significant fertility challenges. It would be life-changing,\" Jacobs told ABC News. \"We shouldn't make them choose between serving our country and building their families.\"\n\nRep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., is seen on the floor during Speaker of House votes on Friday, January 6, 2023. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nDuckworth and Jacobs say that some members of the military have been forced to abandon their military careers because of the lack of infertility treatment coverage by their health care program, called TRICARE. It could present a risk to military readiness, they told ABC News.\n\n\"For too many service members, the lack of TRICARE coverage of IVF has left them with only a few choices: beat the odds and prove that their infertility is directly related to their service, pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children, or leave the military. This is wrong,\" Duckworth said.\n\nIt's also about parity, they said: Starting this year, members of Congress are afforded access to plans that offer coverage for infertility treatments. Jacobs and Duckworth say the same should be true for military service members.\n\n\"It makes no sense that members of Congress and the rest of the federal workforce will get this, but military families still won't,\" Jacobs said.\n\nThis is not the first time that Jacobs and Duckworth have attempted to expand IVF access for military service members. They tried to get this same provision included in the massive military spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, last year as both parties tried to reassure voters of their support for IVF and other infertility treatments.\n\nThough the proposal made it through the House Armed Services Committee, it never made it into the final version of the bill that President Joe Biden signed into law during the waning days of his presidency.\n\nSimilar legislation was separately blocked in the Senate by Republican Sen. James Lankford last year. At the time, Lankford said that while he supports IVF, he was concerned about the indefinite cost of the legislation and the possibility it opened for \"future definitions for gene editing or for cloning.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth prepares for a hearing to examine the preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board on the Jan. 29, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 27, 2025. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nDuckworth and Jacobs' newest effort, however, is a stand-alone bill that could be voted on not as an amendment, but as it's own legislation.\n\nDuckworth, an Iraq War veteran, has been vocal about her own experiences using IVF to conceive her two children. She was involved in multiple efforts to expand IVF access last Congress that were ultimately blocked by Republicans.\n\nShe said this new proposal would give Republicans the opportunity to make good on President Donald Trump's pro-IVF rhetoric that he's used on the campaign trail and at the White House.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to voters on the campaign trail that he would go even further by making IVF free if elected and has repeated the bold-faced lie that he is governing on the principle of 'promises made, promises kept,'\" Duckworth said in a statement. \"Republicans can now help him partially fulfill his broken IVF promise by joining our commonsense legislation that would make sure those who answer the call to serve have access to the care they need to build their family.\"\n\nNo Republican has yet signed on as a cosponsor, but Duckworth and Jacobs are pointing to Trump's comments as recently as last week touting his support for IVF as a possible boon to their efforts.\n\nOn the campaign trail, as an Alabama State Supreme Court ruling temporarily threw IVF access into question, Trump was vocal about his hope to make IVF continually accessible. He referred to himself as the \"father of IVF\" and issued a statement that said \"I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.\"\n\nArmy Soldiers, participate in the Soldier Readiness Process for Mobilization Operation, at the JRC located on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., March 31, 2025. U.S. Army\n\nTrump has continued to make his support for IVF known. As recently as Wednesday when, during a Women's History Month event, he referred to himself as the \"fertilization president.\"\n\n\"Fertilization. I'm still very proud of it, I don't care. I'll be known as the fertilization president, and that's OK,\" Trump said. \"That's not bad. I've been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right?\"\n\nIt's at this point unclear if the bill, which if pushed by Democrats to the Senate floor as a stand-alone bill would require the unanimous support of the Republican conference, would have the support it needs to pass. It's also unclear if efforts to include it in this year's National Defense Authorization Act or other major legislative pushes could lead to passage.",

(AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Seven years ago, when a joint bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico was awarded the 2026 World Cup, rifts created by tariffs — yes, back then, too! — and a proposed border wall were glossed over because of the neighbors’ longstanding political and economic alliances.\n\n“The unity of the three nations″ was the overriding theme articulated by Carlos Cordeiro, then-president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. “A powerful message,” he called it.\n\nWell, here we are now, with the soccer showcase arriving in North America in about 15 months, and President Donald Trump back in office — inciting trade wars between the neighbors, not to mention across the globe, by levying tariffs that come, then go, then return, with more promised, including what the Republican calls “ reciprocal tariffs ” starting Wednesday.\n\nIt’s hard to know how, exactly, the current geopolitical fissures, made all the more stark every time Trump or those in his administration talk provocatively about making Canada the 51st state, might affect the World Cup, its organization and coordination, fans’ travel plans and more.\n\n“Oh, I think it’s going to make it more exciting,” was Trump’s take during an Oval Office appearance with FIFA President Gianni Infantino last month. “Tension’s a good thing.”\n\nGiven that the U.S. also is preparing to welcome the world for FIFA’s Club World Cup in June, golf’s Ryder Cup in September and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the question becomes: Will the world want to come?\n\nAnd, taking Trump's border and visa policies into account, will the world be able to?\n\nAlan Rothenberg, who ran the 1994 World Cup and successfully oversaw the bid to host the 1999 Women’s World Cup as then-president of U.S. Soccer, thinks the answers to those questions are “Yes.” Pointing to concerns about the last two World Cups, in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, he noted those still attracted attendance totals above 3 million apiece.\n\n“People love the United States around the world — frankly, we wouldn’t have the immigration issue that we’re dealing with if that weren’t the case — so a lot of this is government-to-government,” Rothenberg said. “A passionate soccer fan is not going to be held up by that.”\n\nHe doesn’t think one of the host nations would drop out of the World Cup, say, or that other countries might boycott, as happened at the 1976, 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n“More than anything, they’ll see it as an opportunity for, perhaps, rapprochement, rather than escalating the tensions,” Rothenberg said.\n\n“Besides, from an organizing standpoint, if either Canada or Mexico withdrew\" from the World Cup, he said, \"the U.S. would pick up the games in a heartbeat.”\n\nStill, as the White House stance on tariffs and Russia’s war in Ukraine have put Europe on edge, and relations with other countries have become fraught, it might not be a surprise if soccer stadiums for the U.S. games at the World Cup offer the same sort of anti-American sentiment heard when spectators in Canada booed “The Star-Spangled Banner” during hockey’s 4 Nations Face-Off in February.\n\nFIFA, soccer’s governing body, did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment, but Infantino has never hidden his admiration for Trump, which he often demonstrates via social media. They have met at least five times since the U.S. election in November.\n\nLast week, when Kirsty Coventry was elected president of the International Olympic Committee — becoming the first woman in that position — she was asked how she would work with Trump and what she would tell athletes about traveling to the U.S. for the next Games.\n\n“I have been dealing with, let’s say, difficult men, in high positions since I was 20 years old,\" Coventry said with a chuckle, \"and first and foremost, what I have learned is that communication will be key. That is something that will happen early on. And my firm belief is that President Trump is a huge lover of sports. He will want these Games to be significant. He will want them to be a success.\"\n\nReferring to concerns about whether the administration might deny some athletes visas, she added: \"We will not waiver from our values … of solidarity in ensuring that every athlete that qualifies for the Olympic Games has the possibility to attend the Olympic Games and be safe during the Olympic Games.”\n\nThe overriding assumption among those involved in the Olympics is that Trump will assure the 2028 Games are a success.\n\nAs U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee chairman Gene Sykes put it: “I can’t speak for him, but I think he’s the kind of person who probably believes that having these go very, very well is a reflection of his leadership.”\n\n“The most likely outcome is that Trump’s nonsense won’t have an impact,\" said Smith College professor Andrew Zimbalist, an expert on the economics of sports.\n\n“My guess is that if relations between Canada and the U.S. deteriorate to the point that there are travel restrictions and spending restrictions,\" Zimbalist said, \"Trump would — just like he’s making exceptions all the time on his tariffs policies — make an exception for a month or six weeks.”\n\nThe U.S. and Canadian soccer federations declined AP requests for comment on how White House policies might affect the 2026 World Cup.\n\nGabriela Cuevas, who represents Mexico’s government in meetings with FIFA, said she considers the tariffs and the soccer event “separate issues,” adding that she believes “the World Cup could be a route to engage in a conversation.”\n\nObservers tend to agree, saying logistics such as security cooperation or team transportation from city to city — or country to country — should not be hampered when it comes to the World Cup, scheduled to take place in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.\n\nThe borders might become an issue, though.\n\n“The main thing FIFA needs to move for this event is not car parts, and it’s not wheat, and it’s not electricity. It’s people. That’s your real concern,” said Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n“What were previously pretty reasonable border crossings could become much more challenging, simply because both sides amp up their level of inspections and the United States, in particular, cuts down government services that allow people to move effectively between countries.”\n\nAs for the fans, 29-year-old Mexican businessman German Camacho Pacheco said “soccer is religion” in his country, so when it comes to the World Cup, “I don’t think they care about tariffs.”\n\nCamacho, wearing the Monterrey club jersey of defender Sergio Ramos while on the way to watch a game at a sports bar in Mexico City, said he doesn’t expect there to be any effect at all on the World Cup “unless this goes from a trade war to an actual war.”\n\n___\n\nAP writers Greg Beacham in Inglewood, California; Nancy Benac in Washington; Ronald Blum in New York; Graham Dunbar in Costa Navarino, Greece; Eddie Pells in Denver; Anne M.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSpecifically, the executive order calls for proof of citizenship nationwide on the form used when registering to vote -- a change from current election laws and a provision voting rights experts have taken issue with. Documents that can be used for proof, according to the order, include a passport, Real ID, a military ID card, or a valid federal or state ID.\n\nBut the lawsuit points out that the order does not accept identification documents issued by Tribal governments or birth certificates as forms of proof. The suit also raises questions about the approved methods, arguing that only half of Americans possess a passport and \"most\" Real IDs do not indicate citizenship.\n\nRegardless, the lawsuit suggests the order's direction to the Election Assistance Commission to change the form to add the proof of citizenship requirement could violate the Voter Registration Act of 1993, which according to the lawsuit gives the EAC \"exclusive authority\" to administer the form.\n\n\"In keeping with the NVRA's intent to create a simple and easy-to-complete registration form, the NVRA specifies that the Federal Form may not \"include any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nTrump's order suggested that noncitizens can easily vote in federal elections, but experts have called noncitizen voting a \"vanishingly rare phenomenon\" that is easily prosecuted. According to a study of over 23 million votes cast in the 2016 election, officials identified only 30 suspected incidents of noncitizen voting, only 0.0001% of the total votes cast.\n\nSeparately, the executive order also takes aim at mail-in voting, making federal funding conditional on states setting a deadline for ballots to be received by Election Day. Trump -- who was charged with multiple federal crimes for his effort to overturn the 2020 election in cases that were dropped once he was elected -- has repeatedly suggested that mail-in ballots have led to an increase in voting fraud.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the provision about mail-in ballots is unlawful, arguing that \"states have wide discretion and flexibility\" to establish the time, place, and manner of federal elections under the Elections and Electors Clauses in the Constitution.\n\n\"Congress can enact election laws if it chooses, but absent a conflict with federal law, States have the power to establish and follow their own election laws,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAccording to the suit, seventeen states, plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have laws that allow ballots to be counted as long as they are mailed by Election Day and received by a certain deadline afterward.\n\n\"Many of these States have had such receipt deadlines for many years, and Congress has declined to pass any laws dictating ballot receipt deadlines,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that Congress has \"long established\" that the federal Election Day is the first Tuesday in November, in addition to establishing the date that presidential electors must be appointed, but \"has left further regulation in this area largely up to States.\" The lawsuit says the U.S. Supreme Court \"has said that while votes must be cast by Election Day, some aspects of the election process, such as tabulating all votes, will naturally take place after Election Day.\"\n\n\"The Attorney General does not have the authority to 'enforce' the federal Election Day statutes, and the President cannot order her to do so. Nor does a State \"violate\" those statutes when it counts validly cast ballots mailed by Election Day that are received after Election Day if State law so allows,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit also suggests the executive order could make it harder for citizens abroad and those serving in the military to vote. The executive order signed by Trump directs to secretary of defense to update the form used by these groups to register and request an absentee ballot -- called the \"Federal Post Card Application\" -- to include a requirement of documentary proof of citizenship as well as \"proof of eligibility to vote in elections in the State in which the voter is attempting to vote.\"\n\nThe lawsuit notes this form is required by law as part of the the The Uniformed And Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, passed in 1986 to \"protect the voting rights of Americans serving in the military, their families, and other U.S. citizens living abroad.\" The suit claims the changes required by the order would be \"impossible given the format required by Congress.\"\n\n\"Neither the President nor the Secretary of Defense has any legal authority to disregard UOCAVA's statutory requirement to make such a post card available to military and overseas voters,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nTogether, these provisions would have a \"significant impact\" on voting rights., the lawsuit claims.\n\nMembers of LULAC -- a Hispanic and Latin American civil rights organization -- for example, would be harmed if some of its members \"who are eligible to vote often do not have the requisite citizenship documents.\" the lawsuit states. The organization expects that efforts to register voters \"will plummet.\"\n\nThe Arizona Students' Association will similarly be harmed by the proof of citizenship requirement, the lawsuit states, despite it being required when voters register on the state form there.\n\n\"Even those members who are able to register face imminent harm. Some members will be able to obtain or access DPOC only by spending significant time, money, and/or effort to do so, and will face greater difficulty registering because of the DPOC Requirement,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nABC News' Michelle Stoddart contributed to this report.",

And more importantly, I think that when you have a team captain, you have to support the team,\" Fine said.\n\nRandy Fine speaks with ABC News, March 31, 2025. ABC News\n\nFine's race is one of a pair of special elections for the U.S. House in Florida on Tuesday that might have an impact on the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Speaker Mike Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.\n\nWhile the Republicans are favored to win in each district -- given that both districts were ruby-red in 2024 -- some have speculated that the margin between the Republicans and Democrats in each district could be tighter than anticipated, and voices within the Republican Party have raised concerns over Fine's campaign. Fine and his allies, including Trump, have maintained he has momentum.\n\nRep. Randy Fine answers a question about his House Bill 3-C: Independent Special Districts in the House of Representatives April 20, 2022, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla.

We're doing great.\"\n\nFine's Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, received Sen. Bernie Sanders' endorsement on Friday. Weil has also far outpaced Fine in fundraising.\n\nABC News Live reached out to Weil's campaign as well to request an interview.\n\nIf elected, Fine will be dealing with issues such as the nation's economy. A recent Gallup poll showed that 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of it.\n\nAsked by Macedo if he thinks Trump has done enough on inflation, Fine said he does and emphasized how his race ties into Republicans advancing Trump's agenda.\n\n\"I think he's giving everything -- inflation and ... everything else a lot of attention,\" Fine said, blaming the Biden administration for a \"mess\" that Trump had to take on.\n\nMentioning improvements in the price of eggs and fuel, Fine added, \"There's more work to be done, but I think he's doing a great job, and that's why it's important that people go vote for me, so that we can keep that Republican majority in Congress and continue to fight for President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nAsked if he'd support Trump's planned tariffs this week even if they raise prices, Fine said he doesn't know that they will raise prices and that he supports tariffs generally because \"the time for America being taken advantage of is over.\"\n\nHe also said he has spoken to Florida farmers about the issue.\n\n\"Florida farmers are supporting me. The major agriculture entities in Florida are supporting me, and they're happy because they see foreign goods be dumped into the United States, subsidized by other countries. They have a difficult time selling their products abroad, and they are glad to see America standing up for fair trade practices,\" Fine said.",

Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz has heated up in recent weeks -- especially in the 6th District where Waltz served.\n\nBoth lawmakers resigned to join the Trump administration, although Gaetz withdrew his nomination as attorney general when it became clear that he did not have sufficient support in the Senate to become confirmed.\n\nAhead of the election, Republicans have 218 seats in the House -- a slim majority. The GOP will hold onto its majority no matter what the results of the Florida elections, but if they lose a seat, that will make legislating more difficult, especially on measures where every Republican doesn't vote with the party.\n\nWhile Republicans will hold on to their majority regardless of the results in Florida, the election comes amid concerns over maintaining that power -- a concern that spilled into the public when President Donald Trump recently asked Rep. Elise Stefanik to withdraw from her nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations rather than give up her seat.\n\nOne of the Florida races is in play more than expected, with uncertainty among some Republicans over whether their candidate in the 6th District, state Sen. Randy Fine, can keep the seat safely in Republican hands, given that he has lagged far behind the Democratic candidate, teacher and progressive Josh Weil, in fundraising.\n\nThus, while the Republicans are favored to win in each district, given that both were ruby-red in 2024, some have speculated that the margin between the Republicans and Democrats in at least the 6th District could be tighter than anticipated.\n\nRep.

The ice sheet has been shrinking and losing mass over the last few decades due to climate change.\n\nAn iceberg the size of Chicago that broke off of an Antarctic ice shelf has revealed a thriving ecosystem beneath it, according to researchers.\n\nOn Jan. 13, the iceberg, named A-84, broke off from the George VI Ice Shelf, a massive floating glacier attached to the Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet, according to the Schmidt Ocean Institute.\n\nThe remnants of a massive iceberg calving event are seen from Research Vessel Falkor (too). Alex Ingle/Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe seafloor beneath, previously covered by 209 square miles of ice, had never before been accessible to humans. A team of researchers aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor (too) oceanographic research vessel were working in the Bellingshausen Sea, on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, but dropped everything to make their way to the ice shelf. The pivot was described as a \"serendipitous moment' by Schmidt Ocean Institute Executive Director Jyotika Virmani.\n\n\"We seized upon the moment, changed our expedition plan, and went for it so we could look at what was happening in the depths below,\" said Patricia Esquete, expedition co-chief scientist and biology researcher at the Centre of Marine and Environmental Studies, based in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe team arrived at the site on Jan. 25 and observed the seafloor for eight days with the help of a remotely operated vehicle named SuBastian, which dove nearly a quarter mile to gather data on the geology, physical oceanography and biology of the never-before-explored underwater terrain.\n\nIcebergs seen around Research Vessel Falkor (too). The newly exposed Antarctic seafloor also allowed the team to gather critical data on the past behavior of the ice sheet. The ice sheet has been shrinking and losing mass over the last few decades due to climate change. Alex Ingle/Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nUnexpectedly, they found a \"beautiful, thriving ecosystem,\" Esquete said. The significant biomass and biodiversity of the ecosystems surprised the researchers, especially since deep-sea ecosystems typically rely on nutrients from the surface that slowly trickle down to the seafloor – an unlikely occurrence when the sea surface is covered by 500-foot-thick ice. The marine scientists hypothesize that ocean currents may be responsible for moving life-sustaining nutrients to the ecosystem.\n\nThe species detected in the previously unknown ecosystem include large corals and sponges supporting a plethora of marine life, including icefish, giant sea spiders and octopuses, with several previously undiscovered species likely among them, the researchers said.\n\nA large sponge, a cluster of anemones, and other life is seen nearly 230 meters deep at an area of the seabed that was very recently covered by the George VI Ice Shelf, a floating glacier in Antarctica. Sponges can grow very slowly, sometimes less than two centimeters a year. Therefore, the size of this specimen suggests this community has been active for decades, perhaps even hundreds of years. ROV SuBastian/Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nBased on the size of the animals, the communities have likely lived in that spot for decades, even hundreds of years, Esquete said.\n\nLittle is known about the seafloor beneath the floating ice shelves in Antarctica, according to the institute.\n\nOver the last few decades, global warming has caused the Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet to shrink and lose mass, the researchers said. Satellite images released by NASA show the progression of the iceberg's break from the George IV Ice Shelf from January through February 2025.\n\nA new iceberg has spent part of the Southern Hemisphere’s 2024-2025 summer ricocheting off parts of the Antarctic coastline. Over the past month, the potato-shaped berg has drifted about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from its point of origin near the George VI Ice Shelf’s southern end along the base of the Antarctic Peninsula. NASA\n\nAntarctica is also home to the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \"Doomsday Glacier\" due to its potential to contribute to severe global sea level rise, should it continue to melt.\n\n\"The ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a major contributor to sea level rise worldwide,\" said expedition co-chief scientist Sasha Montelli, a researcher at University College London.\n\nThe newly exposed seafloor allowed an international team of scientists to gather critical data about the past behavior of the larger Antarctic ice sheet. Autonomous underwater vehicles called gliders were also deployed to study the impacts of glacial meltwater on the physical and chemical properties of the region. Preliminary data shows a strong meltwater flow from the George IV Ice Shelf, according to the institute.\n\n\"Our work is critical for providing longer-term context of these recent changes, improving our ability to make projections of future change – projections that can inform actionable policies. We will undoubtedly make new discoveries as we continue to analyze this vital data,\" Montelli said.",

Roosevelt broke with the two-term tradition set by George Washington and secured a third term as World War II was breaking out.\n\n\"It would be completely unprecedented for a president to openly defy the dictates of the 22nd Amendment and, even more so, to attempt to run or serve again as president,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional expert at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\"The threats and insinuations no doubt thrill his base, but there is no constitutional basis for the current president to try to serve as president after two elected terms,\" Gerhardt said.\n\nThe only way legal way for Trump to be able to run for a third term, experts said, would be to amend the Constitution -- an incredibly unlikely outcome as it would take two-thirds of both the House and Senate, or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention. Then, any change would require three-fourths of the states to sign on for ratification.\n\n\"This statement by Trump was brilliant in terms of capturing and diverting attention,\" said Schultz. \"His supporters love it and his detractors will rage over it. In the process, no one will talk about the price of eggs, tariffs and a shaky stock market.\"\n\nExperts break down 'methods' floated by Trump and his allies\n\nAs for Trump's claim that one of the \"methods\" could be to run as Vance's vice president and then be passed the baton, experts point to the 12th Amendment from 1804 as a barrier.\n\n\"The 12th Amendment states that anyone who is ineligible to be president is also deemed to be illegible to serve as vice president,\" said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"This means that Trump could not serve as vice president, which is the post he would need for the Vance scheme to be executed.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the Inauguration of Donald J. Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, Jan. 20, 2025. Julia Demaree Nikhinson /Pool/Getty Images\n\nSteve Bannon, a fierce Trump ally, has also floated what he's called alternatives to allow Trump to run in 2028.\n\nBannon, in remarks at the New York Young Republican Club gala in December, has argued that he could run again as Trump's two terms in office were not consecutive.\n\n\"Since it doesn't actually say consecutive, I don't know, maybe we do it again in '28? Are you guys down for that? Trump '28?\" Bannon said.\n\nSchultz said that argument doesn't have a sound legal basis.\n\n\"The overall limit of serving as president for ten years is both textual proof on the bar to run for a third term and an indication of the intent of the congressional drafters that they did not want anyone serving for more than two terms,\" Schultz said.\n\nSection 1 of the 22nd Amendment states: \"no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nSchultz added that measure \"was put into place to allow for a situation where a president dies more than halfway into a term and the vice president succeeds that person. The Constitution thereby allows for the vice president to serve out the remaining term and then serve two more terms, for a total of ten years.\"\n\nWhat happens if Trump tries anyway?\n\nTrump has already tested the bounds of the Constitution governing presidential power several times in the first months of his second term.\n\nSeveral Democrats viewed his comments on Sunday as another escalation against the rule of law. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote on X: \"This is what dictators do.\"\n\nIn the past, Republicans have largely played off Trump's musings about a third term as a joke intended to rile his opposition. But just days after his inauguration, Republican hardliner Rep. Andy Ogles introduced a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits to allow Trump to seek another four years in the White House.\n\n\"A crisis could arise if Trump runs for president or vice president in 2028,\" Burden said. \"The Constitution prohibits serving in office but not running for office. If Republicans nominated him, they would be betting that they can violate the Constitution and somehow allow him to serve if he wins.\"\n\nIf Trump attempted to run, it would be up to election officials and then ultimately the courts to decide. In the 2024 campaign, several states challenged Trump's eligibility to seek the Republican presidential nomination under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment due to his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The legal battle went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Trump's favor.\n\n\"If an ineligible person such as Trump is permitted to run knowing that he is not eligible to serve, it is a dangerous collision course in which the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law would be seriously tested,\" Burden said.\n\nJames Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, said Trump would lose in court should he attempt to run again.\n\n\"Most of the Constitution is written in broad, textured, difficult to define terms. What is a speedy trial? What is cruel and unusual punishment? What is equal protection? How much process is due process? The 22nd Amendment, however, is black and white,\" Sample said.\n\n\"But if you can succeed in turning questions that are that clear-cut into debates, then the overall goal of undermining the Constitution and undermining the rule of law and maximizing executive power is served even if you lose the particular battle,\" he continued. \"This particular battle is not a winnable battle. He is not going to serve a third term, but merely by framing this as a debate, he will succeed in further eroding respect for the Constitution.\"",

Kennedy races toward the hospital seconds after he was shot in Dallas. (AP Photo/Justin Newman, File)\n\nOscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film “JFK” portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, is set to testify to Congress on Tuesday about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the killing.\n\nScholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.\n\nThe first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nRepublican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve “one of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.” Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.\n\nStone's “JFK” was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.\n\nThe last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy “probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence “to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.”\n\nThe Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.\n\nFor Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.",

In the aftermath of the 2023 earthquake in Morocco, for example, a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team was deployed just hours later, although Morocco did not ultimately ask for DARTs.\n\nThat same year when Libya endured catastrophic flooding, DARTs were deployed the same day. And when a major earthquake struck Turkey and Syria that same year, the DART teams were also launched just a few hours after the disaster hit. In both cases, the DARTs took a few days to get on the ground.\n\nU.S. Indo-Pacific Command military personnel continue to work alongside Thai military and first responders near the collapsed State Audit Office building in Bangkok, Thailand, which fell after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, March 28, 2025. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command\n\nThe U.S. response comes amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle USAID, laying off thousands of employees, revoking funding for more than 80% of its programs and closing its headquarters, although those efforts are being challenged in multiple court cases.\n\nOn Friday, the State Department announced it was officially shuttering the agency and taking over “many of USAID's functions and its ongoing programming.\"\n\nThe State Department has pushed back on the assessment that cuts to USAID have limited the earthquake response, but officials say there has been at least some logistical impact caused by the reorganization, rather than a lack of funding.\n\n“I would reject the notion this is obviously a result of the USAID cuts and that kind of funding,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday. “We’re certainly in the region.”\n\nIn the meantime, it was Chinese teams that arrived 18 hours after the quake and more than 400 Chinese personnel are now on the ground in the region. Beijing has sent in planes full of supplies, providing $14 million in aid. China also has multiple teams in Thailand.\n\nIt’s a public relations win for China, showing it can be a reliable partner when its neighbors are in crisis.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Monday posted on X photos and videos of Chinese workers on the ground, rescuing survivors and delivering supplies, saying, “China, a friend in need.”\n\nAt the site where a high-rise building collapsed on Sunday in Bangkok, a group of U.S. military personnel were coming and going from the search area throughout Monday. The American team is working with Israeli soldiers to search for survivors, sending drones into areas too dangerous for rescue workers to reach.\n\n“We’re learning a lot from the Americans, and they’re bringing in a lot of good equipment,” said Choktong Issarangkool, one of the volunteers in the rescue and search teams who is also acting as a translator for the American teams.\n\nThais say they are grateful for the American assistance, something this region has become accustomed to following a natural disaster: U.S. aid teams have always been among the first on the ground to help.\n\nState Department officials said discussions regarding a more extensive response to the earthquake are ongoing, including the possibility of sending a DART team, although it might be smaller than in past efforts.\n\n“Our disaster experts, including those based in Bangkok, Manila and Washington, D.C., continue to monitor the situation with coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region,” Bruce said.\n\nShe emphasized that the $2 million of initial support would be implemented through partner organizations that were already working in the impacted areas.",

Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nThe Education Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration are joining in the comprehensive review of the school.\n\nThe move comes as the administration's joint task force doubles down on removing antisemitic conduct and harassment from elite universities. The administration stripped Columbia University of $400 million in grants earlier this month after a task force investigation found inaction by the school to protect Jewish students.\n\nMonday's actions against Harvard come after a similar review led to Columbia agreeing to comply with nine preconditions for further negotiations regarding a return of canceled federal funds, according to the release.\n\nThe task force will review hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to Harvard and its affiliates, according to the release.\n\nThe agencies will also review another nearly $9 billion in grants to Harvard to ensure it's in compliance with \"federal regulations\" and \"civil rights responsibilities,\" the release said.\n\nIn response to the review, Harvard President Alan Garber released a statement saying, \"We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry.\"\n\n\"It is present on our campus,\" Garber continued, \"I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university.\"\n\nGarber said, however, that the $9 billion in federal funding that is \"at stake\" as the university works to combat antisemitism could halt \"life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.\"\n\n\"As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive,\" Garber added.\n\nHarvard alum Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., told ABC News he believes too many universities have gone unchecked for tent encampments and hostile demonstrations that involved students overtaking buildings on campus in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict that broke out after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nKiley, who sits on the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the administration's review \"incredibly refreshing\" and a proactive solution to protect the civil rights and safety of Harvard's Jewish students.\n\n\"We need to make sure that the rules are enforced, that civil rights laws are abided by and that there are consequences for illegal activity,\" Kiley said.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators protest outside Harvard Yard during Harvard University's class of 2024 graduation ceremony in Cambridge, Mass., May 23, 2024. Rick Friedman/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOregon Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici is also a member of the Education and Workforce Committee and alongside Rep. Kiley, Bonamici serves on the subcommittee on higher education.\n\nBonamici told ABC News she believes the administration has been pushing a concerning attack on institutions of higher education.\n\nShe said threatening federal funding is a bridge too far. \"There are ways to address anti-Semitism that don't involve this type of threat,\" Bonamici said, adding, \"What they're trying to do is intimidate these universities, like they're doing with law firms, intimidate them into taking positions that are antithetical to higher education and free thought and critical thinking, so it's extremely concerning.\"\n\nProtests erupted on college campuses around the country after civilian casualties mounted in Gaza as Israel launched a military campaign in response to Oct. 7, vowing to eradicate Hamas -- which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.\n\nThe federal response comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing McMahon to abolish the Department of Education and another order that takes measures to \"vigorously\" combat antisemitism.\n\nThe Harvard review also highlights the administration's promise to ensure colleges would suffer the federal consequences if they foster antisemitic protests and demonstrations in the wake of Oct. 7.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said, \"My promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Congress is investigating Harvard and nearly a dozen other schools for allegedly fostering antisemitism on campus.\n\nA House Education and Workforce Committee report last fall found many universities have failed to adequately discipline antisemitic conduct. A summary of the more than 100-page report alleges the \"overwhelming majority\" of students accused of antisemitic harassment or other acts of antisemitism on campuses faced minimal disciplinary action for their alleged violations.",

He asserted that Joe Biden was more engaged in Hunter Biden's business dealings than the former president publicly let on, and that \"the entire value add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\nJoe Biden has forcefully denied any wrongdoing and Republicans were unable to find evidence that he used his political perch to support his son's businesses. A House impeachment inquiry concluded last August without any articles of impeachment drawn up.\n\nMatthew Schwartz, an attorney for Archer, told ABC News that \"the American jury system is an amazing thing, but as the trial judge held in finding serious questions about Devon Archer's innocence, sometimes juries get it wrong.\"\n\nSchwartz said that Trump's \"pardon corrects a serious injustice, and finally allows an innocent man to be free of the threat of misguided prosecution.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his post amid sweeping cuts at the agency and across the federal health workforce handed down Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn an email to staff, FDA tobacco director Brian King said: “It is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave.”\n\nKing was removed from his position and offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDozens of staffers in FDA’s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations.\n\nKing, who joined the agency in 2022, has been vigorously criticized by vaping lobbyists for ordering thousands of companies to remove their fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes from the market. During his time at FDA, teen vaping has fallen to a 10-year low.\n\nHis removal comes just days after FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks was forced out, citing health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for vaccine “misinformation and lies” in his resignation letter.\n\nThe latest changes mean that nearly all of FDA’s top leaders overseeing drugs, food, vaccines, medical devices and now tobacco products have resigned or retired in recent months.\n\nThe leadership vacuum comes as Kennedy moves to fire 3,500 FDA staffers and pushes ahead with plans to scrutinize ultra-processed foods, childhood vaccines, antidepressants and other long-established products.\n\nThe wave of departures means incoming FDA commissioner Marty Makary — who was confirmed last week— will inherit an agency without many of its top experts and a beleaguered workforce that has been rocked by weeks of layoffs and a chaotic return-to-office process. Only a handful of FDA employees are political appointees, with nearly all of the agency's scientific reviews and decisions overseen by career officials.\n\nNeither Makary nor Kennedy have said much about how tobacco policy fits into their plan to “Make America Healthy Again.” Despite historically low rates of smoking, tobacco-related diseases remain the nation’s leading preventable cause of death, blamed for more than 490,000 annually.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA’s tobacco center has been besieged by criticism from all sides including congressional lawmakers, anti-smoking advocates, and tobacco and vaping companies.\n\nPoliticians, parents and anti-tobacco groups want the FDA to do more to stamp out unauthorized vaping products that can appeal to teens, many of which are imported from China. Tobacco and vaping companies say the FDA has been too slow to approve newer products for adult smokers — including e-cigarettes — that generally carry much lower risks than traditional cigarettes.\n\nUnder King, the FDA rejected applications for millions of flavored e-cigarettes, citing insufficient data that the products would help adult smokers while not becoming popular with underage kids. Those rejections have resulted in multiple lawsuits against FDA from vape makers, including one that was argued before the Supreme Court in December.\n\nThe Vapor Technology Association, an industry group, has been running ads urging Trump to follow through on a campaign pledge he made to “save the flavored vaping industry.”\n\nThe FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes for adults, mostly from major vaping brands owned by legacy tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynold’s Vuse and Altria’s Njoy.\n\nOther recent FDA departures include:\n\n— Deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones, who resigned in February after dozens of his staffers were fired.\n\n— Director of FDA’s drug center, Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, who stepped down days before President Donald Trump took office.\n\n— The agency’s second-ranking official. Dr. Namandje Bumpus, who resigned late last year.\n\n— FDA’s longtime medical devices director, Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, who retired last summer.\n\nMany deputies and senior scientists have also retired or stepped down in recent weeks.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He later filed an I-589 application for asylum and although Abrego-Garcia was found removable, an immigration judge \"granted him withholding of removal to El Salvador.\"\n\nBut earlier this month, Abrego-Garcia was stopped by ICE officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed.\" After being detained over gang affiliations, he was transferred to a detention center in Texas. He was then sent to El Salvador on March 15.\n\nSalvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua recently deported by the U.S. government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center prison, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, obtained Mar. 16, 2025. Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia via Reuters\n\n\"Abrego-Garcia, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was on the third flight and thus had his removal order to El Salvador executed,\" said Robert L. Cerna, acting field office director for ICE in a sworn declaration. \"This removal was an error.\"\n\nIn response, the government said Abrego-Garcia had the opportunity to present evidence to show he was not a part of MS-13. \"Abrego Garcia had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue,\" the government said. \"He had the opportunity to give evidence tending to show he was not part of MS-13, which he did not proffer.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance said in a statement on X that Abrego-Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right\" to be in the U.S. Vance added that \"it's gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize.\"\n\nIn the filing, Yaakov M. Roth Acting Assistant Attorney General Civil Division for the Department of Justice said the court lacks jurisdiction to review the removal of Abrego-Garcia and said that the plaintiffs are seeking his release from Salvadoran custody by \"financial pressure and diplomacy.\"\n\nRoth also added in the filing that there is no clear showing that \"Abrego Garcia himself is likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"\n\n\"While there may be allegations of abuses in other Salvadoran prisons -- very few in relation to the large number of detainees -- there is no clear showing that Abrego Garcia himself is likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT,\" Roth said. \"More fundamentally, this Court should defer to the government's determination that Abrego Garcia will not likely be tortured or killed in El Salvador.\"\n\nIn the sworn declaration, Cerna said the removal was \"carried out in good faith.\"\n\n\"This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia's purported membership in MS-13,\" Cerna said.\n\nABC News' Justin Gomez contributed to this report.",

Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe ruling came after an appeals court on Saturday denied Kaul's emergency motion to stop the giveaway from taking place.\n\nKaul wrote in his initial filing on Friday that he was asking for emergency relief to stop Musk and America PAC \"from further promoting a million-dollar giveaway to attendees of a planned event on Sunday, March 30, 2025, and prohibiting Respondents from making any payments to Wisconsin electors to vote.\"\n\nHowever, the judge assigned to the case, the Honorable Columbia County Circuit Court Judge W. Andrew Voigt, refused to hear the lawsuit before Sunday's Green Bay rally with Musk -- prompting Kaul's emergency motion asking a Court of Appeals to take action.\n\nAfter that emergency motion was rejected, Kaul appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to step in on Sunday.\n\nLawyers for Elon Musk and America PAC then filed motions for the recusal of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justices Rebecca Frank Dallet and Jill J. Karofsky.\n\nThey argued that because Dallet and Karofsky campaigned for Crawford, and Crawford has been critical of Musk, \"to avoid any potential perceptions of bias and manifestations of possible bias, Justices Dallet and Karofsky should decline to participate in consideration of this matter.\"\n\nThe lawyers also framed the planned Sunday night giveaways as \"spokesperson agreements\" for spokespeople for the PAC.\n\nIn the initial lawsuit, shared by Kaul's office, Kaul argued that \"Musk's announcement of his intention to pay $1 million to two Wisconsin electors who attend his event on Sunday night, specifically conditioned on their having voted in the upcoming April 3, 2025, Wisconsin Supreme Court election, is a blatant attempt to violate\" state law, which \"forbids anyone from offering or promising to give anything of value to an elector in order to induce the elector to go to the polls, vote or refrain from voting, or vote for a particular person.\"\n\nThe suit asked for a restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from any further promotion of the million-dollar gifts to attendees of the planned Sunday March 30, 2025,\" as well as a temporary restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from making any payments to Wisconsin electors to vote,\" and injunctive relief to \"restrain and prohibit all actions by Defendants taken in furtherance of a planned violation\" of the state law.\n\nIn addition to presenting the checks on Sunday night, Musk said his PAC is launching a \"Block Captain\" program ahead of the election on Tuesday, where participants will make $20 for each picture they post of someone with a Schimel sign and a thumbs up outside of their home.\n\nSo far, two political groups aligned with Musk -- America PAC and Building America's Future -- have poured nearly $20 million into supporting Schimel for the open seat.\n\nThe world's richest man has used cash giveaways in the past, including a controversial $1 million sweepstakes offered to voters in swing states during last year's election cycle as part of an effort to boost President Donald Trump's chances of winning in those states.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court election, on Tuesday, has generally become the center of a political firestorm, and has become the most expensive state supreme court race in American history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.",

This is Aufguss: a multi-sensory sauna ritual that’s part purification, part fever-dream.\n\nDeep in the Dolomites — the UNESCO-capped mountains — wellness has long been part of the landscape itself. Here, ancient remedies are reimagined with a contemporary twist and a touch of the surreal, all infused with the rugged spirit of the Alps.\n\nThe journey begins in Bolzano, capital of South Tyrol and gateway to the Dolomites. A melting pot of Italian and German culture, locals toast beer and wine in Piazza Walther , savor boiled dumplings at Batzen Häusl , and cycle down cobblestone streets beneath sweeping mountains. Its most famous resident, Ötzi the Iceman, can be seen in the Museum of Archaeology Bolzano , a 5,300-year-old glacier mummy who was discovered complete with a pair of prehistoric hiking boots.\n\nHotel Hörtenberg Castle is located within\n\nBolzano, where visitors will find the cathedral, cafes, and shops. Photograph By Camillo Balossini/Robertharding, Getty Images\n\nIt all feels like a fairytale, particularly when approaching Hotel Castel Hörtenberg, a luxurious hotel-spa set in a former Renaissance castle complete with turrets and a coat of arms. Carefully restored by the Podini family owners, it’s now a blend of luxury and history. Period frescoes and original stucco adorn the suites; guests can dine in their torch-lit dungeon restaurant, Le Segrete ; and unwind in a spa complete with a Finnish sauna and hammam, overlooking an expansive outdoor pool nestled between jasmine and hydrangeas. It’s the perfect Alpine launch pad.\n\n(Related: Why choose the Alps for your next summer adventure)\n\nThe bus from Bolzano snakes along orchard-lined rivers and tight mountain switchbacks to Siusi, where a gondola whisks residents up to COMO Alpina Dolomites. There’s a certain thrill the first time one catches sight of the snow, as mottled green turns to blinding white. This ski-in, ski-out resort has direct access to the slopes, with an elegant lounge showcasing magnificent views of Europe’s highest Alpine plateau. The modernist building reflects its surroundings, with immense windows flooding the space with light; even the beds are turned down to form mountain peaks. Three restaurants offer refined takes on local classics, like the Tyrolean Gröstl — roasted potatoes, speck, eggs, and dried flowers — an indulgence well worth waking up for.\n\nCOMO Alpina Dolomites has direct access to the slopes, making it a great choice for active travelers. Photograph By Martin Morrell, Como Hotel\n\nAdventure-seekers will find incredible skiing, hiking, and more directly on their doorstep, but COMO is synonymous with spa treatments.\n\nSignature therapies include their Shambhala massage and the \"traditional hay bath,\" described as an \"ancient mountain wellness treatment.\" After warming themselves with a sip of ginger tea, guests are led into a dedicated space to be plunged into a bath of hot hay, a practice long hailed by South Tyrolean farmers as a cure for arthritis and aching muscles. The air hangs heavy with herbal flowers and balsamic scents, and feels like a pungent weighted blanket. This unique experience concludes with a rejuvenating goat milk cream facial, leaving participants refreshed and renewed.\n\nFor the more daring, COMO offers nightly Aufguss sauna rituals, a sweltering show that pairs fierce steam, tribal music, and biting scents of lavender, mint, and citrus released from melting, essential-oil laden snowballs. It’s a sensory experience that creates a profound sense of tranquility.\n\nAccessible only by gondola from nearby Lana, Vigilius Mountain Resort is a high-altitude, eco-friendly hideaway. With monastic solemnity, clients are compelled to pause and let the Alps work their restorative magic. Designed by architect Matteo Thun with nature at its core, Vigilius brings together clean lines, local larch wood, natural stone, and clay so that it appears as if the hotel completely disappears into the surrounding forest.\n\nThe hotel's unique design makes it appear as if the property disappears into nature. Photograph By Tobias Kaser, Hotel Viglius Vigilus Mountain Resort's Aquiléia Spa has a pool, sauna, steam room, and much more. Photograph By Tobias Kaser, Hotel Viglius\n\nThe property features the authentic Stube Ida , open to visiting hikers, and a communal piazza that hosts nightly aperitivo. In an effort to encourage genuine disconnection, Wi-Fi is disabled at 11 p.m., leaving guests to enjoy a fire-lit library.\n\nAt Vigilius, massages feel elemental: Delivered with heated wooden sticks and sculpted stones applied with warm pine oil. Guided woodland walks (complete with crampons) reveal the wavering rhythms and folkloric histories of every tree, rock, and fern.\n\nFor those who want to venture higher still, an almost otherworldly single-seater chairlift transports visitors through the trees to San Vigilio Church , one of the highest in all of Tyrol, a place steeped in quiet, ancient mysticism.\n\nFurther south in Pinzolo, Lefay Resort & SPA Dolomiti stands as a cathedral to wellness. Carved into the mountains, it feels effortlessly lavish, with stunning views at every turn and an enormous state-of-the-art spa with four distinct water areas. The temptation on arrival is to make a beeline for the heated indoor-outdoor pool, where a warm haze veils Trentino’s pine-topped peaks.\n\nLefay’s philosophy is centered around harmonizing yin and yang: the Active and Balance program springs from movement and rest, taking you into the wild before back into relaxation. Inspired by traditional Chinese medicine, it merges the five elements with an Alpine sensibility and begins the moment you arrive. There’s a consultation, a custom itinerary, and a tacit request to give yourself to the process.\n\nLocated in Pinzolo, Lefay Resort & SPA Dolomiti's spa activities include taking guests outside, from snowshoeing and hiking to plunging into frozen mountain lakes. Photograph By Alberto Masnovo, Shutterstock\n\nIn the morning, balance takes on a new meaning: A guided snowshoe alpine ascent fills the lungs with crisp, mountain air. Upon reaching a frozen mountain lake, guests are invited to embrace the snow, be it face-first, shirt off, or a full immersion cold plunge. The shock is electric, inciting sharp breaths that reveal mental clarity. After a few moments standing in the blinding snow, heart bounding, sun blazing, it’s time to descend back down to Lefay where warmth and stillness await. In the afternoon, it’s a float in a saltwater pool, weightless and adrift with whatever epiphanies might surface.\n\n(Related: Hot sauna, cold plunge. Here's where to try contrast bathing)\n\nPerched atop of Merano, Miramonti Boutique Hotel feels like a cinematic world unto itself. It’s no surprise that it’s not far from where James Bond once dodged assassins on skis: This landscape was made for high drama. Born from the shared dream of Carmen and Klaus Alber, the hotel exudes a warm, Nordic aesthetic which mirrors its rugged surroundings.\n\nMiramonti Boutique Hotel has a renowned spa, but it's also well-known for its forest bathing practice. Photograph By Markus Edgar Ruf, Miramonti\n\nThe Sky House sits at its peak, a suite anchored into the rock. Spanning three floors, it features an open fireplace and a secluded deck concealing a hot pot pool. Furnished with Fritz-Hansen furniture and centered around ineffable views, it’s the pinnacle of Alpine relaxation.\n\nThe spa feels like a constellation scattered across the wilderness, offering a network of timbered walkways leading to a steaming onsen, an infinity pool that hovers on the edge of the world, and a spacious Finnish sauna with floor-to-ceiling windows framing the Alps. At dinner, the panoramic restaurant is like looking at the world from an airplane, the lights of Merano valley twinkling distantly below.\n\nAmong their many offerings, guests can experience the art of forest bathing with therapist Monika Laner , a practice which fosters a deep connection with nature by way of a mindful walk. There’s a tree greeting ritual which involves shaking hands with a spruce, wrapping one’s arms around its bark like an old friend, and communing deeply. Sipping pine needle tea in arboreal silence, participants find accord with the intimate acoustics of the surrounding snow. A small pine cone is offered as a memento as a reminder of the day’s lesson.\n\nIn the Dolomites, relaxation is something earned through transformative experiences. Be it sweated out in extreme heat, buried in steaming hay, or plunged face-first in the snow, the mountains strip everything away until only clarity remains. Balance isn’t found, it’s felt — in the heat, the cold, the silence. If you’re lucky, you get to bring it home.\n\n(Related: Why this Austrian Alpine town is forever linked to James Bond)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nThis unique retreat – a converted lighthouse on the southernmost tip of Giglio island – comes with its own helipad. But for your average traveller, making pilgrimage to its remote setting is integral to its charm. Travel out to the Tuscan isthmus of Argentario for the ferry from Porto Santo Stefano, an hour across the turquoise Tyrrhenian to arrive in Giglio Port. Follow the island’s coastal road until it turns to a red sandy trail at Punta di Capel Rosso, where it’s a steep hike down through groves of cliff-clinging cactus to reach your quarry: a striking red-and-white-striped beacon atop terracotta cliffs. The lighthouse starred in 2013 Italian film, The Great Beauty, and its cinematic beams can be seen from Rome’s Cinecittà movie studios, some 23 miles away.\n\nThe scene\n\nAround an hour from Tuscany’s coast, northwest of Rome, rising from the deep turquoise of the Tyrrhenian Sea, Giglio is a green, serene island just five miles long and three miles wide. It has been self-sufficient for centuries, has steep coastal cliffs and a mountainous interior lined with the vestiges of the ancient drystone terraces that once divided the island into plots of vegetables and grains, olives and vines. A web of red, sandy donkey tracks traverses the rocky terrain, linking the island’s three hamlets, which are home to communities traditionally fed by trammel fishermen, whose floating nets bring in everything from red mullet and bream to lobster and squid.\n\nToday, there are fewer fishermen and a few more paved roads, and those rocky tracks see traffic from hikers rather than donkeys. Trails weave through protected woodland and dense groves of holm oak, chestnut and olive trees, which cling tenaciously to cliffs. They lead down to deep coves where staggeringly clear waters attract swimmers, kayakers and yachtsmen, along with pods of passing cetaceans. Castle-like fari (lighthouses) guard the rugged, largely undeveloped coastline, which, in a handful of secluded bays, opens onto half-moons of sunshine-yellow sand.\n\nGiglio Porto is the island’s main town and sole port. Photograph by arkanto, Alamy\n\nThe lighthouse\n\nThe last of Giglio’s functioning fari, on the island’s largely uninhabited southernmost tip, is a red-and-white-striped beacon that doubles as one of Tuscany’s most unusual guesthouses. Built in 1883, Faro Capel Rosso sits in exquisite solitude on a promontory of protected woodland. This remote retreat is accessed by a 20-minute hike along a steep, boulder-strewn sandy trail (backpacks only) or a flight to the cliffside heliport. The lighthouse, which was part-converted into a guesthouse that opened in 2023, has granite steps that descend to deep coves secluded by boulders, via sculptural groves of prickly pear cactus and Mediterranean scrub fragrant with wild thyme and oregano. Turquoise water beckons, and several species of whale and dolphin come to feed here at the confluence of two water currents.\n\nSummer on this Tuscan island is busiest, but with a hot, dry microclimate, Giglio enjoys swimming weather well into November. May to September is the peak season for boating, sailing and diving — with most activities bookable from the lighthouse’s small dock. Hiking the island’s network of trails, which lead out from the doorstep, is best in shoulder season, and October coincides with the olive harvest. For the past few years, local producer Olio Goffo has been restoring Giglio’s centuries-old groves, which had run wild across the hillsides. The company organises tastings of its rich, green extra virgin olive oil at a spot above Campese Beach to the northwest.\n\nOne of Faro Capel Rosso’s four suites that have been converted from lodgings for the lighthouse keeper. Photograph by Viola Mura, Faro Capel Rosso\n\nThe stay\n\nExpect spellbinding seclusion at this Wes Anderson-style edifice. The four rooms that housed keepers’ families until the lighthouse’s automation in the 1980s are now capacious suites, with free-standing tubs and windows framing sea and sky; it’s as if you’ve set sail from your bed. Cleverly converted bits of seafaring kit double as lamps and tables — all interspersed with local art, including jelly fish-like bronze ceiling pendants by Florentine artist Matteo Pierozzi, which scatter light like sunbeams over water.\n\nCharming resident housekeepers Davide and Carla Moglie host simple breakfasts and communal home-cooked dinners. They can pack picnics on request and days are spent hiking, swimming and staring at the immense blue until the lighthouse springs to life at dusk, sending its steady beams into the night. With a 23-mile range, it’s visible from Rome. There’s virtually zero light pollution elsewhere on the island, and stargazing takes on an almost cinematic scope from the roof terrace, directly under the slow strobe of the rotating optic.\n\nHow to do it\n\n\n\nThis story was created with the support of Faro Capel Rosso Suites sleeping up to four at Faro Capel Rosso cost from €300 (£248), half board. Pisa and Rome airports are just over three hours by road or rail from Porto Santo Stefano, which is an hour’s ferry ride to Giglio.",

        "content": "‘It’s the curvy path’\n\nThis whole journey started because Roberts’ took a leap of faith.\n\nAs a media professional, Roberts has worked for CosmoGirl, Essence, Ebony and Heart & Soul magazines. She eventually started her own entrepreneurial publishing nonprofit endeavors, sharing stories of women changemakers around the world. She followed a job to D.C. in 2016, and visited the newly-inaugurated National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n“That’s how I saw the photograph that changed everything.”\n\nHad she not moved to D.C., she says she may not have visited the museum. And had she visited as tourist and not a resident, she may not have meandered the museum’s halls with such leisure, and she may not have taken notice of the details of one portrait in particular.\n\n“I think all of those things were leading me to this moment. It’s all connected, it’s the curvy path,” says Roberts.\n\nThe photo of a crew of Black women in wet suits aboard a boat was her first encounter with DWP. It beckoned her to follow. She phoned the co-founder, Kenneth Steward. She pledged to join them.\n\n“The universe works in strange ways,” says Roberts, reflecting on how she grew up nowhere near an ocean.\n\n“I imagined the divers. And then I imagined myself as one of them. I didn’t know it would lead anywhere, I just knew I wanted to know more.”\n\nSo she quit her job to follow the divers and help tell their stories.\n\nA way of honoring ancestors\n\nThe March, 2022 issue of National Geographic magazine featured Roberts, making her the first Black woman Explorer to grace the cover of the publication. Photograph by Wayne Lawrence\n\nRoberts’ path shows a nuanced story as she ricochets from peaks and valleys toward a calling. It’s the detail and complexity she aims for in the narratives she uncovers in her work.\n\n“Think about the Clotilda shipwreck… that’s a story that no one would know if the Clotilda descendants hadn’t been like ‘oh, we have saved artifacts and the stories of our ancestors, we’re not going to let anyone forget them.’”\n\nThe Clotilda , Roberts reflects, represents a uniquely complete story. The vessel sailed in 1860, illegally transporting captive Africans from present-day Benin to Mobile, Alabama. It is said a wealthy landowner by the name of Timothy Meaher challenged Northern businessmen with a thousand-dollar wager, claiming he could slip African people past federal officials and into Mobile Bay.\n\nThe ship itself is remarkably well-preserved in the muddy freshwater of Alabama’s Mobile River, compared to other wrecks, which are often shattered on the sea floor, coalesced into the marine ecosystem, or dissolved over time. And the Clotilda’s African survivors, who were removed from the ship as the captain burned it to hide evidence, established the community of Africatown in Mobile once they were freed from enslavement after the Civil War. They neighborhood they established eventually grew into a community of tens of thousands, including their descendants. It still exists today and which continues to honor the stories of those ancestors from the nation’s last known slave ship.\n\n“That's often not what you get around stories that involve African Americans,\" Roberts says. \"Most of us cannot trace our histories all the way back to a slave ship or to a particular country in Africa because the records of the enslaved were not recorded in detail. So it’s incredible and very powerful that these descendants know the actual stories of their ancestors that came from Africa.\"\n\nFor the podcast Roberts interviewed not only the descendants of those on slave ships, but close to 100 other historians, archaeologists and community members about their unique relationships to this history. “By the end of it, I realized that these weren’t just stories of death, that these were stories of life, too,” Roberts recalls.\n\n“It’s a complicated history, but that’s the way history is supposed to be.”\n\nThe Christianus Quintus and Federicus Quartus wreck site were the first dive Roberts recalls leaving an impression on her, “I felt more than anything a sense of agency and power,” she says.\n\nIn 1710 two Danish slave ships, the Christianus Quintus and Fredericus Quartus went down in the Atlantic. Some 40,000 Danish bricks signaled the wreckage to experts in the 1970s, despite their considerable decomposition. A cannon and large anchor are still laid out as artifacts on the seabed. After quashing a revolt, the two vessels veered off course, missing their St. Thomas destinations by over a thousand miles, the crews mutinied, freed approximately 650 captive people due to dwindling resources, and scuttled the vessels which now lie in the ocean sands of present-day Costa Rica.\n\nAs the site came into view for Roberts, “I felt, ‘I see you and I’m going to help bring this story back to human memory. We are going to help make sure you are honored, not forgotten.’”",

It’s December in southern Kazakhstan, and the landscape near the Syr Darya River is smudged in shades of brown and taupe—dormant grasses, silted floodplains, leafless trees. This is not the most picturesque stretch of riverbank, strewn as it is with food wrappers, bottles, a decomposing sedan. Overhead, the sun is obscured by a haze of coal- and woodsmoke. But when it comes to what Bernie Kuhajda is searching for, the spot feels perfect.\n\n“This is the habitat we need,” says Kuhajda, an aquatic conservation biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. He’s hoping to find a species of sturgeon—the Syr Darya—that’s native to these waters but hasn’t been seen since the 1960s, after a series of Soviet dams was built throughout the river system. Those projects blocked access to the fish’s spawning grounds and forever changed the flow of the Syr Darya, which drains from the high peaks of Kyrgyzstan into what is now the remnants of the Aral Sea. If the sturgeon somehow still exists, Kuhajda thinks this silty, shallow expanse of river is where it can be found.\n\n(Critically endangered sturgeons threatened by proposed dams in Caucasus.)\n\nSome months earlier, Kuhajda had been contacted by the conservation organization Re:Wild, which administers a program to search for what it calls lost species—creatures that haven’t been seen for at least a decade and could be extinct, but there’s not enough data to be conclusive. The officials at Re:Wild reached out to Kuhajda knowing that he was one of a very small collection of scientists who have ever laid eyes on the Syr Darya sturgeon. As a graduate student in the 1990s, he visited museums in London, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and videotaped 27 spindled specimens, bleached white from years of storage. “They said, ‘You’re the expert,’ ” Kuhajda says, remembering the call with Re:Wild. “And I said, ‘Well, I’ve seen them dead in a jar.’ ”",

But fear not, apartment dwellers. Below, environment and sustainability experts offer their suggestions for making composting work for you—without any smelly buckets of decaying food waste sitting on your kitchen counter.\n\nWhy composting is good for the environment—and your food\n\nComposting is essentially \"nature’s way of recycling,\" according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It involves microorganisms breaking down organic material, including food scraps, into fertilizer, creating a new use for these materials and keeping them out of landfills.\n\n\"When added to soil, compost enhances soil tilth and fertility, suppresses plant disease, improves the ability of soil to retain nutrients, helps soil retain water, and improves soil structure,\" says Brenda Platt, director of the composting for community initiative at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.\n\nMany people who compost on their own use the resulting soil enhancer to grow their own produce. That unique, natural fertilizer contains nutrients that can't be found in other kinds of fertilizer, according to Sophie Jones, a sustainability project associate at George Washington University's Office of Sustainability. A 2023 study published in ISME Communications suggests that using compost when growing produce can result in more nutritious crops than ones grown without compost.",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "When searching for urban hotels, “includes garden” is not one of the typical search attributes. After all, when that city happens to be Tokyo, by many accounts the world’s most populous metropolitan area, a hotel with a garden seems impossible to find. However, you’ll be pleased to know there are a number of hotels that come with their own green spaces, some of which date back hundreds of years.\n\n1. Popular for cherry blossoms since the Edo period\n\nClosest metro station: Gotanda\n\nEven back in the Edo period (1603CE-1867CE), the hillside adjoining present-day Tokyo Marriott Hotel was popular for its sakura, or cherry blossoms. Perhaps as one consequence of that, Iemitsu Tokugawa, the third shogun of the ruling Tokugawa dynasty, had a palace built there in 1636.\n\nGotenyama garden in Shinagawa, Tokyo, is popular for cherry blossoms every spring. Photograph By Shunskee.t, Getty Images\n\nAt the time, the neighborhood (in today’s Shinagawa ward) was developing as an important rest stop along the ancient Tokaido trade route between the former imperial capital Kyoto and Edo (what came to be Tokyo). Whereas Shinagawa had become a bustling port, famous for boating and clam-digging at low-tide, Tokugawa shogun had availed of the new palace, called Shinagawa Goten, as a resting place, and for falconry. As a tribute to its regal past, the park was named Gotenyama, (“Mt. Goten”). Highlights include maple and gingko trees best seen during the autumn, rare (for Tokyo) white dandelion between March and May, and of course, cherry blossoms in early spring.\n\nAlthough there’s no direct access through the hotel, Gotenyama Garden is right behind it. The garden is free to access, and has a nice modernist waterfall atop which one can sit on a rare Tokyo bench.\n\n2. Designed by the Imperial Palace's landscaper\n\nClosest metro station: Takanawadai\n\nTeiji Kusuoka was a master gardener who made two lofty contributions to the Tokyo landscape. The first involved Kusuoka helping to create the new Imperial Palace gardens in the aftermath of World War II. Owing to his expertise, Kusuoka was then hired to plan and create a garden abutting a cluster of hotels close to Shinagawa Station. Inaugurated in 1971, the Japanese Garden, or sometimes the Prince Hotel Japanese Garden, is surrounded by four properties of the Prince Hotels & Resorts Group — Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa + the ryokan within Takanawa Hanakohro, The Prince Sakura Tower Tokyo, and the Grand Prince Hotel Shin Takanawa. Some guest rooms in each of the hotels offer garden views.\n\nThe garden is free to access, and all hotels have direct access to it. History enthusiasts will appreciate that this Japanese garden isn’t merely known for its 17 varieties of cherry trees, 16 types of seasonal flowers, and central pond where strollers can feed the koi, or carp. There’s a pagoda dedicated to Kannon, the Japanese Buddhist goddess of mercy, which possibly dates back as far as the mid-12th century. Additionally, a 17th century bell tower from the bygone capital of Nara, and a temple gate with Edo-era stone lanterns also augment the pleasant stroll through an otherwise heavily urban neighborhood. As a bonus, when the weather cooperates, visit during the nighttime to appreciate the symmetry of the take-akari, or bamboo lights, which add an ethereal touch to the walkways.\n\n(Related: Everything you should know before visiting Japan)\n\n3. This garden is renowned for its camellias\n\nClosest metro station: Edogawabashi\n\nAs far back as the 14th century, the lush backyard of the contemporary Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo was called Tsubakiyama, or “Camellia Mountain.” It is no coincidence that the hotel’s Japanese name commemorates this history; the phrase translates as “villa on Mt. Camellia.”\n\nThe grounds of Chinzanso are now a part of a large luxury hotel, but visitors are free to walk the grounds of the garden. Photograph By John S Lander/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nOccupying the site of the current Hotel Chinzanso, the original villa retreat was built in the early Edo period. Then, in 1878, Aritomo Yamagata, future Japanese prime minister and patron of the arts, built the first formal garden on the grounds to accompany his mansion. After having witnessed widespread destruction during World War II, Eiichi Ogawa, a prominent businessman, planted more than 10,000 trees as an homage to Yamagata’s legacy. Chinzanso opened as a garden restaurant in 1952, and has been a highly sought-after wedding and photography venue since. A number of guest rooms also offer views of the garden.\n\nChinzanso Garden is free to access; one must enter through through hotel. Although there are 20 varieties of cherry trees, the camellia, the garden’s main event, typically bloom between February and April. Fun fact: to simulate unkai, or a sea of clouds, mist is periodically released in the garden, adding a mysterious feel to an already photogenic setting.\n\n4. This garden was the backdrop for the Olympics\n\nClosest metro station: Nagatacho\n\nStarting with the rule of daimyo (feudal lord) Kato Kiyomasa in the late 16th century, a significant plot of trees had been present in the precinct of the modern Hotel New Otani Tokyo. Eventually, the plot was given to the influential Ii clan, who resided there until the end of the Edo era. After, the land was inherited by the Fushimi no Miya imperial kinfolk, who added pine and camphor trees into the mix.\n\nScuttling their plans to sell the property to foreigners after World War II, Yonetaro Otani, sumo wrestler-turned-hotelier, established residency there. At the request of the Japanese government, Otani devised the Hotel New Otani in 1964 — with the garden as its backdrop — to house Olympians for the city’s first Olympic games.\n\n(Related: 10 of the best hotels in Tokyo)\n\nNew Otani Hotel's garden is the perfect place to spend a few hours when you need a break from city life. Photograph By Trevor Chriss / Alamy\n\nThe Hotel New Otani Japanese Garden is free to access, and entry is only through the hotel. It's an excellent place to spend a couple of hours, given its impressive karesansui (rock gardens), tree fossils, strikingly vermillion Taiko Bridge, active koi pond, and vast waterfall that spans much of the park. Two of the garden’s oldest living occupants are a Japanese nutmeg tree, and a Yew Plum pine; it is said that they both date to the late 18th century.\n\nThe wabisabi (an aesthetic concept based on imperfection and impermanence) gets punctuated by seasonal nighttime lighting themes; for example, expect orange, red, and yellow colors during the fall, while white and pink signify early spring.\n\n5. This hotel has a hidden apiary on its roof\n\nClosest metro station: Suidobashi\n\nAlthough the more formal word for garden in Japanese is teien, another way to describe them is niwa. Employing the latter in both phrase and variety, the eponymous Hotel Niwa Tokyo is one of the newer properties on this list, having only opened in May 2009. In spite of being just a few minutes’ walk from Tokyo Dome City, a theme park, shopping, and stadium complex, Hotel Niwa Tokyo has four different types of small gardens that guests can enjoy. The courtyard, replete with a babbling brook and a small grove, greets all visitors outside of the entrance. The Zen terrace highlights karesansui, better known as a rock garden, and the lounge terrace offers lots of natural light, and a place to sip freshly brewed matcha or coffee. Finally, the rooftop terrace is best known as a hot spot for yoga and meditation.\n\nVisitors are excited to learn that there’s an actual secret garden at the top of the hotel. Once warmer weather arrives, expect to try herbs and vegetables grown on-site, as well as some outstanding honey produced by bees living in the apiary.\n\nTo fully appreciate each of Hotel Niwa’s gardens, one must be a guest. However, anyone can partake in the outdoor lobby-level garden and waterway leading to Yukuri, the property’s Japanese restaurant.\n\n(Related: A culinary guide to Tokyo)",

Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and is expected to be observed on March 30 or March 31 this year, depending on the sighting of the moon.\n\nBeginning and ending with the new moon, Ramadan falls on the ninth month of the Arabic lunar calendar. It is believed by Muslims to be when the first verses of the Koran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than a millennium ago. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and vices like gossip and lying. Not only is it meant to be a period of self-reflection, but to serve as a reminder to be charitable to the less fortunate.\n\n(Five unique ways Ramadan is celebrated around the world.)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nFounded on the White Isle’s southeastern coast by seventh-century Phoenicians, Ibiza Town — known to locals as Eivissa — is one of Spain’s oldest cities. Over the centuries, Mediterranean tides brought countless conquerors to its shores, many of whom left their mark on Dalt Vila, the city’s fortified, UNESCO-listed old quarter. And yet, such is Ibiza’s beach-holiday and clubbing fame that its capital’s historical riches, along with its flourishing culinary scene and quietly bohemian energy, continue to fly under the radar. While many local businesses close between November and Easter, a well-timed visit to this layer cake of a city makes for an absorbing shoulder-season break — perfect for those keen to sidestep the high-season crowds.\n\nThe canons on the walls surrounding Dalt Vila are replicas of those that were used in action here in the 18th century. Photograph by L. Apolli/ AidBC, Getty Images\n\nThe city’s old town is characterised by a tangle of sloping, whitewashed lanes, where drying clothes hang from balconies and hot-pink bougainvilleas spill over walls. Make for Dalt Vila’s highest point, where a cobbled square, Plaça de la Catedral, looks onto colossal 16th-century ramparts, built to protect Ibicencos from marauding seafarers. Looming above it all lies Catedral d’Eivissa, a pale stone basilica built in the gothic style, on the site of the city’s Moorish-era mosque. Just behind it, Castell d’Eivissa, a collection of restored Moorish and Catalan ruins, is set to become a smart Parador hotel in 2025. You can dig deeper into the city’s Arabic history at the Centre d’Interpretació Madina Yabisa. The intimate museum’s artefacts and audiovisual displays shine a light on Ibiza Town between the 8th and 12th centuries, when the city was a thriving port town under Islamic rule.\n\nRolling views across the city’s terracotta rooftops and glimmering marina crop up throughout Dalt Vila. The lantern-lit Plaça del Sol is the favoured spot to take in the vista. Soak it up over a glass of Cava and a slice or two of Ibérico ham at S’Escalinata, an easy-going tapas bar where locals and visitors mingle on the cascade of cushioned steps. Five minutes’ walk from here, Museu d’Art Contemporani d’Eivissa hosts an eye-opening collection of works by artists who found refuge on Ibiza in the 20th century.\n\nThe Mediterranean tides surrounding Ibiza Town are popular for sailing adventures. Photograph by Atlantide Phototravel, Getty Images\n\nExiting through Portal de Ses Taules, the old town’s grand main gateway, Dalt Vila gives way to the waterfront and the pastel-hued La Marina neighbourhood. Bar-filled Plaça de la Constitució is a popular place to take a break in the heart of the harbour district. At its core lies Mercat Vell, a neo-classical market whose columned facade conceals vendors selling local olive oils, salts and seasonal produce. Dip into neighbouring vintage boutique Holala Ibiza to browse denim jackets and floaty dresses, as well as nearby Ibiza Bagús, which stocks palm-woven bags and beachy kaftans.\n\nIt’s a short hop west to Passeig de Vara de Rey — Ibiza Town’s leafy main boulevard. The pedestrianised haven is lined with cafes, bars and restaurants, including long-standing Ca n’Alfredo. At its northeast end lies the site of the island’s first-ever hotel. Opened in the 1930s and famed for hosting the likes of Orson Welles, the establishment lives on in the form of Montesol Experimental, its art deco balconies perched below a rooftop bar overlooking Dalt Vila. The spirited buzz spills over into Plaça del Parc and Born, where stylish locals sample drops from Ibicenco wineries and platters of Balearic cheeses. For something more comforting, grab a streetside table at La Barra de la Bientirada. Their homemade tortilla pintxo (a Basque-style tapa), perfectly gooey and filled with wafer-thin slices of potato, is a real highlight. Otherwise, follow the local crowd west into Eixample, the modern part of Ibiza Town. Reart sees chef David Reartes use homegrown ingredients to craft wonderfully original sharing plates, including grilled squid in tonkatsu (a Japanese sauce). Walk south from here and you’ll soon find the UNESCO-listed Necròpolis Puig des Molins.\n\nOf course, even in the heart of Ibiza Town, the beach is never far away, with the isand’s southern coastline offering a welcome break from the urban hubbub. A 30-minute walk around La Marina brings you to Platja de Talamanca, a broad curve of golden sand perfect for a restorative dip in the turquoise Mediterranean.\n\nHow to do it\n\n\n\nThis story was created with the support of the Ajuntament d’Eivissa and Montesol Experimental. Airlines including British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair fly direct to Ibiza Airport, which is five miles from the centre of Ibiza Town. Stay at the Montesol Experimental from €194 (£160).",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "On winter evenings throughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands of starlings gather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.\n\nHow could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.\n\n(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)",

It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.\n\nHe was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett . Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.\n\n“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”\n\nAs an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats.

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Why the Congo Basin appears to be more resilient than the Amazon remains an incredibly complex question, and researchers are looking for answers in the trees. Back at Yangambi, Yakusu leads me down a trail through the surrounding forest and then signals that we should head deeper into the underbrush. As we leave the path, the texture of the ground suddenly changes, crackling softly as dried branches snap beneath our feet and then grow squishy as we step over the soft husk of a decomposing tree trunk. We finally stop in front of a huge tree with a wide, smooth trunk that juts high into the canopy. Part of the mahogany family of trees, it belongs to a particular native species called Entandrophragma utile.\n\nThe tree is part of another long-term survey that’s been happening at the station. To inspect it properly, Yakusu unslings his backpack and produces a wood borer shaped a bit like an oversize corkscrew, placing it against the trunk a few feet above the ground. When he turns the handle, the hardwood seems to resist at first, creaking under the pressure being applied. After a few minutes, Yakusu extracts a long, thin core sample of wood from the inner layers, which he carefully inserts into a protective sleeve. “You have to be careful to not let it break,” he says.\n\nInside the station’s modern wood biology lab—another first in the DRC—researchers would be able to compare the tree’s height and trunk diameter with visible rings from the core sample to determine changes in its growth over time in relation to the climate. “As we’ve demonstrated, the rainforest is warming,” Yakusu says. “This means that the environment in which these trees grow is changing and the conditions for growth are no longer optimal.” In the long run, decreased tree growth could lead to higher tree mortality in the region, one factor responsible for the Amazon’s diminishing capacity to store carbon.\n\nAlready some tree species are disappearing. In the research station’s archives, detailed records on a tree from the same genus, Entandrophragma palustre, show that it was once the most studied species at Yangambi. “But in this forest, you won’t find a single palustre today,” says Yakusu. At the same time, some trees are proving more resistant to extreme climate shifts, which could hold the key to helping the forest adapt. Chadrack Kafuti and Brice Djiofack, two tropical ecologists working at Yangambi’s wood lab, have been closely studying the adaptations of Pericopsis elata, a large-leaved hardwood with the surprising capacity to pause its growth during periods of drought or when sunlight is scarce. That kind of resilience could help direct replanting in areas where the forest has been logged for lumber or affected by wildfires, which are increasingly common.\n\n(Our report on when the Congo Basin reopened to large-scale logging.)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "New Yorkers aren’t afraid of a little schmutz. When Queens-born Chef Shuai Wang and his wife Corrie went hunting for a spot to open their new Charleston restaurant, they wanted a place that was both affordable and authentically homegrown—a tall order in a city where home prices frequently soar past $2 million and two-bedroom apartments cost $4,000 to rent a month.\n\nThe couple found their answer in Park Circle, a 110-year-old historic garden neighborhood in a fast-changing, working-class community called North Charleston with a gritty heritage standing in stark contrast to the genteel, steeple-stippled skyline, expensive boutiques, and luxury hotels further south. For Wang, who starred in the most recent season of Bravo’s Top Chef, that difference felt right.\n\n\"Park Circle is Charleston's Williamsburg,\" he says, drawing parallels to Brooklyn's once-scruffy creative enclave.\n\nIn 2010, Park Circle was the first to celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride in Charleston, and it has become the home to annual music events such as the Riverfront Revival and Rockabillaque. Photograph By North Charleston, via Flickr Creative Commons\n\nCharleston’s new artist district\n\nThe couple opened Jackrabbit Filly on Spruill Avenue five years ago (recently relocating it to nearby East Montague Avenue). They weren't alone. Only a 16-minute Uber ride from downtown Charleston’s Marion Square, Park Circle has quietly become the Holy City’s vibrant magnet, drawing residents priced out of living \"below the neck\"—the stretch of peninsula wedged between the Ashley and Cooper rivers and separating North Charleston from the bourgeois world of the historic city.\n\nNo such airs are on display in Jackrabbit Filly, the 1970s wood-paneled walls furnished with quixotic thrift-store finds contrast with intricate wood screens imported from China. There’s a clatter of plates and the hum of conversation coming from the 44 tables, all booked. The air is filled with aromas of soy vinegar and chili oil, and there is anticipation for dishes such as glass noodles and the Japanese fried chicken known as karaage, so popular devotees drive from miles around to enjoy the food and atmosphere. That’s no surprise to Pearce Fleming, whose airy microbrewery Commonhouse Aleworks sits around the corner.\n\n\"Park Circle's a place that fosters community,\" he says. “It’s what we try to do at our brewery. We exist to bring people together to celebrate over a pint of social lubricant.\"\n\nLocated in the Park Circle neighborhood, Riverfront Park features the Greater Charleston Navel Base Memorial and an 800-foot boardwalk along Cooper River. Photograph By Brooke Becker, Shutterstock\n\nTo encourage that conviviality, Fleming, whose brews include IPAs “Navy Town” and “Park Circle” named for his neighborhood, helped establish one of the community’s biggest festivals. In 2010, Park Circle was the first to celebrate Pride in Charleston, which it continues to do to this day with more than 40 participating organizations. Now, other annual events like the musically minded Riverfront Revival and Rockabillaque, featuring rockabilly music, classic cars, and barbecue, draw thousands of people.\n\nMusic is center stage throughout the year at other venues including Holy City Brewing and the Firefly Distillery, famous for its sweet tea vodka. Visitors can sample the lemony-flavored drink, and its bourbons and whiskeys, in its tasting room. Outside, Firefly’s five-acre music space regularly hosts bands. Past performers included Chappell Roan and Willie Nelson.\n\nFirefly Distillery has a five-acre music space to host music concerts. Previous performers include Chappell Roan, Willie Nelson, Vampire Weekend, and Lupe Fiasco. Photograph By Firefly Distillery\n\nThe history of a streetcar suburb\n\nWhile a Roan concert wasn’t what its founders could ever imagine, Park Circle is finally fulfilling its original intention in some ways. The neighborhood began as a genteel gamble in the 1910s when city businessmen envisioned a streetcar suburb that would lure young professionals and their families north of Charleston's traditional boundaries. \"They couldn't kick start interest in moving there,\" says Brittany Lavelle Tulla, an architectural historian at BVL Historic Preservation Research. \"It couldn’t just get off its feet.\"\n\nInstead, the US Navy took center stage. Its base, the Naval Complex, employed 25,000 workers at its World War II peak. Workers performed a variety of duties from disassembling Nazi U-boats to maintaining Cold War fleets. Their communities—which would incorporate as the city of North Charleston in 1972—earned a brawling, blue-collar reputation immortalized in Pat Conroy's novel \"The Lords of Discipline.\"\n\n(Related: Charleston’s newest museum reckons with the city’s role in the slave trade.)\n\nA burgeoning neighborhood with ties to its historic past\n\nYet Park Circle’s original garden city design endured. The central circular park, that gave the neighborhood its name, still anchored streets that radiated outward like spokes. When the base closed in 1996, that historic blueprint, combined with the bungalows, worker cottages, and mid-century buildings left behind, created perfect conditions for renewal. Young entrepreneurs and artists soon discovered East Montague Avenue's wide, herringbone-bricked sidewalks—perfect for outdoor cafes, kids, and dogs—and a new chapter began.\n\nThe avenue’s shops reflect the neighborhood’s eclectic spirit. Neighborly modern furniture shares space with local artisans’ work. Odd Duck Market sells food and coffee, while Black Octopus Mercantile transformed surf wear into streetwear. The shop is a cheery place, probably due to the ebullience of owner Missy Johnson, who designs most of the merchandise herself. Some of it is regularly featured on the hit teen drama The Outer Banks.\n\n“I love being in Park Circle,” she says. “We may be off the beaten track but we’re quite the gem of the realm sitting between the pine trees and the river.”\n\nThe river that Johnson is referring to is Cooper River, where the old naval facilities are also undergoing a metamorphosis.The 140-acre Riverfront Park now occupies part of the former base, including grounds initially landscaped in 1896 by the famed Olmsted Brothers firm for a project predating the naval yards. Walking paths crisscross beneath century-old live oaks, leading to a 1,200-foot boardwalk jutting into the water.\n\nIn North Charleston, the 55-foot-tall steel arches of the Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge connects Riverfront Park to the River District North development, 70 acres of former naval land that will be transformed into a village with housing, offices, and retail spaces. Photogrpah By Charlotte Evelyn, Shutterstock\n\nThe former base commander's Colonial Revival mansion and its columned porches, or “piazzas” in local parlance, is now an event space overlooking the river where anglers cast for red drum, spotted sea trout, and flounder. The graceful Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge and its two 55-foot-tall steel arches connect the park to the River District North development, an ambitious plan where 70 acres of former naval land will become a mixed-used village with housing, offices, and retail spaces.\n\nWhile the River District North promises a glossy future, Park Circle’s past isn't forgotten. Kelsey Bacon, a floral designer at Roadside Blooms, bridges both. Her great “grand mamie” Virginia Kirkland toiled in the naval factories during WWII. Bacon thinks she would have been amazed to see the transformations that have turned the community into the one now on travelers’ itineraries.\n\n“It's a melting pot of different lives and different people, says Bacon. “As long as I’m in Charleston I’ll be in Park Circle.”\n\n(Related: Discover the best of Charleston with these top 10 things to do.)\n\nWhat you should know\n\nWhere to eat: The tide-to-table Walrus Raw Bar inside Holy City Brewing offers the chance to slurp local oysters and quaff an array of artisanal beers. On East Montague, Southern Roots Smokehouse features brisket, chicken wings, and traditional barbecue sides. Across the street, EVO Pizza offers wood-fired pies like pistachio pesto or the pork trifecta with a farmer’s salad.\n\nWhere to stay: Airbnbs on offer in the neighborhood. Something new in North Charleston: The Starlight Motor Inn, an authentic 1961 motel with strong mid-century modern design vibes and live music in its upstairs bar The Burgundy Lounge (Rates from $100). Downtown, The Ryder, which opened in 2021, offers a contemporary vibe different than many of the traditional hotels (Rates from $203)\n\nWhat to do: New last year, The Park Circle Playground is the country’s largest inclusive playground designed to allow full accessibility to children with autism, sensory issues, or in wheelchairs full accessibility. For playful adults, retro Pinky and Clyde’s Arcade Bar on East Montague lets patrons play vintage video games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man. On Spruill Avenue, the Station offers shoppers vintage housewares and clothing as well as new art and fashions curated by a changing mix of some 30 artists, designers, and thrifters.\n\n(Related: 10 of the best hotels in Charleston, from historic landmarks to hipster hotspots.)",

Driven by curiosity and fueled by optimism, he brought back many plants and fruits now taken for granted, such as mangoes from India, peaches from China, and avocados from Chile.\n\nIn 1902 Fairchild first encountered sakura, the flowering cherry trees of Japan. Enchanted by their beauty, Fairchild wanted to bring the trees back home and ordered 125 sakura trees for his own front yard in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n\nThe nursery owner in Yokohama was so pleased to have an American customer that they charged Fairchild just 10 cents per tree. In the spring of 1906 Fairchild’s imported trees bloomed for the first time, and word of the pink blossoms brought so many onlookers to their home that Fairchild ordered 300 more as a gift to the city of Chevy Chase.\n\n1:46\n\nEliza Scidmore, National Geographic’s first official female writer, photographer, and board member, was also an advocate of the cherry blossoms in D.C. After spending time living and reporting from Japan, she returned to Washington with photographs of cherry blossom trees— “the most beautiful thing in the world” —and began petitioning President Grover Cleveland’s administration to plant them along the Tidal Basin.\n\n(Read about the life and times of Eliza Scidmore.)",

The cost can ramp up when you factor in gear and supplies you may need for specialized excursions, like trekking or kayaking. If you do have to shop for an upcoming trip, it pays to be strategic.\n\n“Buying affordable, high-quality, multipurpose travel gear means spending less money on products pre-trip,” says Sunny Fitzgerald , a travel writer who splits her time between Jordan, Costa Rica, and Hawaii. “I can then use those savings for what I really love—experiencing the destination through adventure activities and locally led tours.”\n\nSpending your hard-earned cash wisely doesn’t mean skimping on everything. “Budget travel isn’t about sacrificing experiences—it’s about making every dollar count so you can explore longer and farther,” says Patricia King , a travel journalist based in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nTo help your dollar go as far as your journeys, we asked experts for their best tips and searched for products that offer great value for the price to last many adventures. Here’s what we found.\n\nOur picks for the best budget travel products\n\nWhen you’re traveling on a budget, every dollar counts. For your next trip, we’ve rounded up some cost-saving tips and great products, from reusable bottles to ingenious containers to travel bags you can use in multiple ways. Read on for more ideas.\n\nTip 1: Pack a multitasking travel bag\n\nSavings: Checked bag fees; spending money on multiple bags\n\nA bag that works as a carry-on, a shopping bag, and a personal bag is one way to cut down on costs. Besides avoiding expensive checked bag fees, you can also skip baggage claim and get going on your trip.\n\n“Multipurpose products make it possible to buy and waste less and pack lightly—which is exactly what eco-minded and budget travelers want,” says Fitzgerald.\n\nIf you do need a suitcase that’s larger than a carry-on, look for less-expensive “dupes” that are made of durable materials like a polycarbonate shell, has four spinner wheels, and a comfortable handle.\n\nOur picks:\n\nAloha Reversible Splash-Proof Tote\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Aloha Reversible Splash-Proof Tote Buy it now on Amazon\n\nFitzgerald swears by her Aloha tote, which she says gets plenty of mileage. She especially loves the strong straps and spacious interior, along with the splashproof material, which Fitzgerald notes is far superior to a standard cloth tote on rainy days in the tropics.\n\nConmigo Ulti Convertible Carry-On Travel Bag\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Conmigo Convertible Carry-On Travel Bag Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis Conmigo bag functions as a crossbody, messenger bag, or a duffel. The TSA-approved electronics sleeve is great for laptops and tablets. A bonus: the memory foam-padded laptop sleeve turns into a seat cushion, which is helpful for delays and layovers. We love all the pockets for storing all of our gear and even toiletries.\n\nJanSport Venture Pack System\n\nPhotograph courtesy JanSport JanSport Venture Pack System Buy it now at JanSport\n\nJanSport’s Venture Pack System combines a backpack and a daypack that’s perfect for air travel and hiking. The backpack has a spacious main compartment, pockets on both sides, and a laptop sleeve, and it fits in the overhead bin. The smaller daypack has all of that and fits under an airplane seat. Both attach, allowing you to wear one on your back and the other in front, leaving your hands free.\n\n( These are our favorite backpacks for travelers )\n\nRicardo Beverly Hills Cambria Hardside Large Check-In Spinner\n\nRicardo Beverly Hills Cambria Hardside Large Check-In Spinner Buy it now at Ricardo Beverly Hills\n\nNeed something bigger than a carry-on? Ricardo Beverly Hills’s Cambria line of stylish yet sturdy hardside bags are less expensive than trendy suitcases. There’s a spacious main compartment plus plenty of pockets, along with a secondary storage compartment with a TSA-recognized combination lock. If you prefer bags with a soft exterior, the company also has a line of soft-sided bags made from recycled plastic, according to the brand.\n\nTip 2: Invest in a set of packing cubes\n\nSavings: Checked bag fees; extra costs to replace lost items\n\nMany travelers swear by packing cubes—and so do we. Investing in a high-quality set can help you maximize luggage space so you can pack everything you need and keep better track of your things while traveling. After all, the last thing a budget traveler wants is to have to replace a pair of swim trunks or slippers.\n\n“I travel frequently and most trips are last minute, with a carry-on only,” says Shannon DalPozzal , an author and travel writer based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “Packing cubes are a must-have, as they not only keep me organized with what I need to pack, they also conserve space to fit other needed items.”\n\nOur pick:\n\nNomatic Packing Cubes\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Nomatic Packing Cubes Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThese nylon packing cubes come in three sizes, sold separately, so you can purchase just what you need. Each zippered cube has a handle and a mesh side so you can see your clothes. The compression feature lets you pack about 50 percent more than you could without it. Just be sure you don’t exceed any weight limits your carrier may have, or you may end up having to pay a checked bag fee.\n\nTip 3: Bring a water bottle and filter\n\nSavings: Money spent on expensive bottled water and to-go beverages\n\n“As an avid traveler, there’s nothing worse than spending money on water,” says Kathryn Anderson , a freelance writer and content creator based in Vancouver, Canada. “There’s also nothing worse for the environment than single-use plastic bottles.” Investing in a reusable water bottle (ideally one with a built-in filter) is a great solution for both issues.\n\nOur picks:\n\nBrita Premium Filtering Water Bottle\n\n“To save both money and the environment, I always travel with my Brita Premium Filtering Water Bottle,” says Anderson. “It has a built-in filtering system, so I can fill it up at any tap or water fountain and always have clean drinking water.”\n\nMade of stainless steel, this double-walled, BPA-free bottle is sturdy and keeps beverages cold for up to 24 hours, says the company. It’s dishwasher safe, fits in standard-sized cup holders, and has a comfortable handle that you can clip to a bag.\n\nThe filters (sold separately in packs of three and six) will set you back at least $15, but each filter lasts about two months.\n\n( These genius collapsible water bottles go anywhere )\n\nLifeStraw Water Filter Bottle\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon LifeStraw Water Filter Bottle Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis water bottle is slim enough to fit in the side pocket of a backpack (the brand also sells larger versions). The company claims that the bottle’s two-step filtration system reduces chlorine odor and taste and filters out microplastics and even bacteria. We appreciate that LifeStraw’s “give back” program pledges to donate a purifier to schools for every 500 products the company sells.\n\nFilters are sold separately and cost $10 for a set of two or $25 for six, with each filter lasting about two months or 26 gallons.\n\nMemobottle Flat Water Bottle\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Memobottle Flat Water Bottle Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis bottle doesn’t come with a built-in filter and is a bit pricey. However, the nifty space-saving flat design means you can tuck it into many more spaces than a traditional bottle.\n\nIt comes in four sizes, three of which are similar to notebooks and one that’s about the height of a bottle. You can choose from a durable plastic or stainless steel—both are suitable for hot and cold drinks, although there is no insulation so the bottle will be hot or cold to the touch.\n\nThe company says each purchase helps Water.org provide safe water and sanitation to communities in need.\n\nTip 4: Use food storage containers\n\nSavings: Cut down on the cost of buying food and food waste\n\nFood storage containers are a great hack for budget travelers. You can use them to store snacks for a flight and even accessories in a pinch. “I’ve become more discerning in my travel experience and don’t like to risk the quality or price of airport/airline snack offerings,” says DalPozzal. “I make my own charcuterie board stashed in silicone food bowls and even carry my own silicone wine glass, just in case I decide to elevate my travel experience with a nice glass of complimentary wine or a bottle of something budget-friendly at my destination.”\n\n“Carrying a few goodies for the flight crew in my tote earns a smile and sometimes a glass of bubbly on board,” adds DalPozzal.\n\nWe also like to bring them along when dining out to store leftovers or packing food to fuel us on busy sightseeing days.\n\nOur picks:\n\nUVI Self Heating Lunch Box\n\nPhotograph courtesy Macy's UVI Self Heating Lunch Box Buy it now at Macy's\n\nThis lunch box stores food in the fridge and heats it up when you’re on the go. It also steams foods like rice. The built-in UV light sanitizes and helps prevent odors, according to the brand. We like the moveable divider for keeping foods separate. We wish there were more than three colors for each member of a family.\n\nBentgo Heat Electric Lunch Box\n\nPhotograph courtesy Bentgo Bentgo Heat Electric Lunch Box Buy it now at Bentgo\n\nThe Bentgo doesn’t have a UV light like the UVI, but the stainless steel container can go in the dishwasher and it’s about half the price. It has two removable containers (the stainless steel one and a second that’s made of silicone). We like that it comes with a car cord, but like the UVI, this one also comes in just three colors.\n\n( 6 easy ways to avoid plastic while traveling that can also save you money )\n\nStasher Silicone Food Bowls\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Stasher Silicone Food Bowls Buy it now on Amazon\n\nSilicone food containers like these are a great alternative to plastic bags and disposable containers. They’re dishwasher and microwave safe. Even better: some have a genius flat bottom so you can use them as bowls. We also like to fill them with ice to pack in a cooler or lunch bag.\n\nTip 5: Bring health and beauty items with you\n\nSavings: Avoid having to buy costly first aid and personal hygiene products, especially if you’re stuck at the airport\n\n“I travel with a small selection of over-the-counter medications and a first aid kit in my carry-on,” says DalPozzal. “One of the biggest expenses while traveling can be experiencing an illness and trying to find a treatment for the symptoms.”\n\nOur picks:\n\nHiBar Shampoo and Conditioner Bars\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon HiBar Shampoo and Conditioner Bars Buy it now on Amazon\n\nAlthough you can bring your own hair products in travel-sized containers, that isn’t always convenient and can sometimes lead to spills. Solid shampoos and conditioners like these are fuss free and travel well. Plus, you don’t have to worry about plastic waste.\n\nKeepGoing First Aid Kit\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon KeepGoing First Aid Kit Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis first aid kit obviously can’t take the place of medical care in the event of a serious illness or emergency, but it has the essentials that can help with scrapes, cuts, and other minor issues.\n\n( Pro travelers love these e-readers for travel )\n\nTip 6: Use a journal\n\nSavings: Overspending on souvenir tchotchkes\n\nWe often travel with journals and planners to organize itineraries. One natural outgrowth? You get a built-in backdrop for recording special moments along the way. Save tickets, museum handouts, coasters and even print out photos to decorate your schedule. You’ll be more likely to stay in the moment while traveling and come back home to a fun memory book to flip through.\n\nOur picks:\n\nErin Condren Travel Journal Vacation Planner\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Erin Condren Travel Planner Buy it now on Amazon\n\nKing says she frequently uses paper planners for both work and personal tasks. She used to create her own by combining parts of other planners to create sections for things like itineraries, activities, and expenses. As a more convenient and practical solution, she likes this Erin Condren planner, which has a monthly calendar for overviews, a packing list, and a convenient spending tracker.\n\nClever Fox Travel Journal\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Clever Fox Travel Journal Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis travel journal is relatively inexpensive but packs a ton of useful sections. Besides an expense tracker, it also has a handy world map, a packing list, pre-travel checklist, and space for jotting down notes and thoughts.\n\nTraveler’s Notebook\n\nAlthough more expensive than the other planners on our list, Traveler’s notebooks have a cult-like following for a reason. The cover is made of durable leather and features a simple, buildable design that can accommodate many trips. The elastic cord on the bind allows you to add several slim notebooks to suit your needs.\n\nTip 7: Make your own coffee\n\nSavings: Not having to plunk down more than $10 for your daily caffeine fix\n\nWe all love to treat ourselves to fancy coffee drinks from time to time. But when you’re on a budget, you can save yourself a few dollars by making your own coffee. You don’t have to turn to your hotel coffee maker either. These days, there are plenty of portable options that produce a perfectly good cuppa.\n\nOur pick:\n\nVerve Instant Coffee Packs\n\nPhotograph courtesy REI Verve Instant Coffee Packs Buy it now at REI\n\nToday’s instant coffee has come a long way from the stale dark crystals from yesteryear. These packs from Verve Coffee Roasters are actually pretty tasty and made for travel. We like the variety pack, but there are a bunch of single flavor packs too. Just add hot water.\n\n( We love these coffee mugs for fueling our adventures )\n\nTip 8: Don’t forget chargers and adapters\n\nSavings: Shelling out for extra chargers and adapters, especially at airports and train stations\n\nCell phones, laptops, and camera gear are travel essentials. Forgetting chargers and adapters isn’t just a hassle, it can end up costing you more than you expect. Be prepared by packing these items first so you can use your devices throughout your trip.\n\nOur picks:\n\nMomax 1-World+ Flow 4-Port Travel Charger\n\nPhotograph courtesy Amazon Momax 1-World+ Flow 4-Port Travel Charger Buy it now on Amazon\n\nThis universal travel charger from Momax has built-in JP/US, AU, EU, UK sockets, plus two USB-A ports and two USB-C ports. It can accommodate up to five devices at the same time.\n\nSatechi 4-Port Travel Charger\n\nThis travel charger from Satechi costs a bit more than the Momax, but it’s a more powerful adapter and has a travel-friendly slim design. It has UK, EU, and AU adapters, plus a mesh pouch to keep everything together.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat are the best travel products to save money?\n\nThe best travel products for traveling on a budget help you avoid expenses that can add up as well as unplanned purchases. They should also serve more than one purpose, such as our pick for a multiuse bag, the Conmigo Ulti Convertible Carry-on. A little preparation—such as remembering to pack adapters or making your own food and coffee—can go a long way to keeping you on budget.\n\nWhat are some creative ways to save money on travel?\n\nRecording travel memories in a travel journal or planner instead of buying souvenirs is a great way to save money. Packing snacks and light meals in a food storage container (such as our pick the Bentgo heated lunch box) to cut down on meal costs is another creative way to save while traveling. Our experts also recommend using multipurpose bags and packing light with cubes to avoid checked baggage fees and the cost of purchasing several travel bags.\n\nWhat are the most versatile travel gadgets?\n\nThe most versatile travel products serve multiple functions. A travel bag like the Conmigo has lots of versatility—it’s a carry-on, laptop bag, and has a cushion enabling travelers to wait out delays or long lines comfortably.\n\nBobbi Dempsey is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in Parade, The New York Times, Harper’s, and others.

        "title": "Synergy? Offlining? We all hate corporate jargon—but here’s why we still use it",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "For something designed to streamline communication, corporate jargon often does the opposite—leaving many employees confused, excluded, or just plain annoyed.\n\nA survey of more than 8,000 working professionals across eight countries found that 58 percent feel their fellow employees overuse jargon. If given the opportunity, nearly half of them would eliminate its usage since deciphering their meanings “causes stress and slows down productivity.”\n\nYet, we persist. Even fictional workplaces like Severance’s Lumon Industries parody the language of modern employment—with their Office Retreat Team Building Occurrences and waffle parties—because it’s all too recognizable. So, what keeps us looping in and syncing up? What does this evolving vocabulary actually do for us, and why does it endure?\n\nDrilling down on jargon\n\nLanguage isn’t just about sharing information; it’s social, says Daria Bahtina, a lecturer from the University of California Los Angeles’ linguistics department. “When we speak, we’re not only passing facts back and forth, we’re performing relationships, identities, affiliations, and stances,” she says. Corporate jargon is a natural by-product of people working together toward a shared goal—even if that goal is surviving a Monday morning meeting.\n\n(New words are spreading faster than ever—thanks to teenage girls.)\n\nThis isn’t limited to managers or corporate departments. Bahtina says specialized language pops up wherever people gather: in a team of software engineers, a hospital triage unit, or even a neighborhood book club after their third bottle of wine. Our lexicon of choice has always spoken to who we are and what we’re trying to make sense of as a collective. “Language follows behavior,” Bahtina says. “We change how we work, how we live, how we relate—and then, we create the words to talk about that change.”\n\nFor example, workplace jargon in the early 20th century 1910s maximized production, precision, and accuracy, essential values during rapid industrialization. By the 2010s, a different set of priorities emerged, shaped by the rise of fourth-wave feminism and social movements. Terms like terms like “DEI,” “unconscious bias,” and “inclusive leadership” entered the mainstream. Even today, TikTok-viral terms like ‘quiet quitting’ and ‘coffee badging’ popularized by a post-pandemic, hybrid workforce signal a culture still negotiating what work means—and who defines it.\n\nJargon doesn’t just connect—it also divides\n\nIf this lingo is meant to mirror our contexts and conversations, why are they so complicated? Doesn’t this defeat its original purpose? Far from it, actually—jargon is also a means of segregation. “Shared jargon can foster a sense of identity and community. Speaking the same language as everyone else is a way of saying, ‘I belong here,’” says Eric Anicich, associate professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.\n\nIn this sense, office jargon doesn’t just describe reality—Anicich says that “it reprograms it, dividing those who are ‘in’ from those who’ll never fully understand.”\n\nOrganizations often use jargon to hide sinister intentions or downplay the real effects of their actions. Anicich cites the 2008 financial crisis, where phrases like “synthetic CDOs” and “tranches of debt products” masked the true scale of the risks involved. In more recent times, mass layoffs are now shrouded in euphemisms like “downsizing,” “restructuring,” or “re-engineering.”\n\n(Why it’s never too late to learn a language as an adult.)\n\nJargon also serves a performative function. Together with Zachariah Brown and Adam Galinsky, Anicich conducted research that shows how office lingo is also used for impression management. According to their findings, lower-status individuals are likelier to use jargon in evaluative situations—not to clarify their message but to signal intelligence and competence.\n\n“In that sense, jargon is the linguistic equivalent of a luxury car: it may have legitimate functions, but it’s also a status symbol,” Anicich explains. “It’s funny until you realize how often real organizations use language to draw invisible lines between insiders and outsiders.”\n\nShould we put a hard stop?\n\nSo, where do we go from here? Should we strip work language down to the simplest possible terms? Not necessarily. “Jargon is used as a tool—it’s not inherently good nor bad, so it depends on how and when you use it,” Anicich says.\n\nIn fact, it’s nearly impossible to avoid. Jargon seeps into everyday life in ways we barely notice. Bahtina mentions how fans of Grey’s Anatomy who have never set foot in a hospital can still understand phrases like “code blue” or “intubate.” “This doesn’t mean that they can perform surgery, it shows how jargon can flow beyond its origin and become part of everyday speech,” she says. Perhaps it can even help us articulate feelings or phenomena that we didn’t know how to describe before.\n\n(How do you save a language from extinction?)\n\nInstead of resorting to extremes, experts agree that it’s best to interrogate whether jargon is being used constructively. Is the shared language fostering understanding or obscuring important information? Is it inviting people to contribute to the discussion or barring them from true belonging? Are employees more focused on reading between the lines than on the task at hand? If our vocabulary is building walls instead of bridges, it may be time to circle back—and rethink how we speak at work.",

We were close to deadline, the editors were deadlocked; when I sought refuge in D.W.’s office, he told me he thought I might decide I needed an alternative, and pulled out an entirely new cover image that he had commissioned overnight. Which was brilliant. And went on to win awards for the cover of the year.\n\nRichard Stengel\n\nD.W. may actually have the perfect human temperament: sunny, never riled, always positive, even, and unruffled. I never heard him raise his voice or get cross with anyone. He was a perfect collaborator because he did not have that ego-driven attachment to his own work. He was looking for the best image to illustrate the story. That’s powerful journalism. He tended to look at last-minute changes, or breaking news, as a fun challenge rather than a piece of bad luck. That’s a useful trait at a newsmagazine. As a culture, we tend to associate creativity with eccentricity or being temperamental. Not D.W. He is endlessly creative while being as steady as an airline pilot.",

But the change comes amid the Trump Administration’s continued push for a deprioritization of climate change in the federal agenda. Read more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action The U.S. government has considered climate change a global security threat for at least three decades. Academic reports at the Naval War College included environmental stressors and climate change in the 1980s, says Mark Nevitt, associate professor of law at Emory University. On the federal level, climate change was first acknowledged as a national security threat by President George W. Bush in August 1991, and the U.S. national security community first listed the issue as a threat in 2008. The issue has typically been included on the annual threat assessment list because of its destabilizing impact—both domestically and abroad. “The annual threat assessment is projecting forward about where the areas of concern and the areas of competition [are], and where the U.S. national security sector should be focusing its attention,” says Nevitt. “Because climate change is just destabilizing different parts of the world, through extreme weather, through droughts, through sea level rise…the intelligence community wants to be ready for future conflicts and future areas of competition.”\n\nClimate change is often referred to as a “threat multiplier” by the intelligence community, because it aggravates already existing problems, while also creating new ones. “It takes things that we were already worried about, like extremism or terrorism, and exacerbates the scale or nature of those threats,” says Scott Moore, practice professor of political science, with a focus on climate and security, at the University of Pennsylvania. “If you have these intensified climate change impacts, they place stress on things like food systems, and worsen already existing tensions within countries.” Climate migration, for example, is on the rise around the world—more than half of new internal displacements within countries registered in 2023 were caused by weather related disasters, according to the Migration Data Portal. “Mass migration leads to a lot of political and social tensions as well as border issues,” says Karen Seto, professor of geography and urbanization science at the Yale School of the Environment. “That … could affect national security, because it could destabilize an entire region.” One study from the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that extreme weather is contributing to migration into the United States through the southern border—with more migrants from agricultural regions in Mexico settling in the United States following extreme drought.\n\nSuch displacement can have major impacts on people's lives and livelihoods, experts say—especially in already fragile regions. “If you have, for example, a really extreme and intensified drought in a country in which extremist ideologies are percolating, these climate change impacts may make it more likely that people are going to stop farming, or might migrate to cities where they may face difficult employment prospects, be socially dislocated and may be more vulnerable to extremism or engaging in some type of violence,” says Moore. On a domestic level, considering climate change helps the U.S. military ensure that infrastructure is built to withstand extreme weather events—and respond to national disasters both domestically and abroad. “You need the National Guard, the Coast Guard, the U.S. military, to basically help out their community when there's an extreme weather event,” says Nevitt. As extreme weather events intensify with climate change this could strain military resources and put more lives at risk if the military does not prepare to address the threat.\n\nInfrastructure within the U.S., like energy and internet grids, also need to be fortified. If regions were to lose power in the case of an extreme weather event, the networks could be vulnerable to attack. “Our energy grid is highly at risk, and we've seen wildfires happening across the country, and so these could again be threat multipliers,\" says Seto. “I think the national security risk is that we are not ready to respond to any threats from foreign agents that may take advantage of the weaknesses that we might have.” Showing that the climate crisis is a priority is also necessary to maintain the United States’s diplomatic strength—especially in regions that see climate change as a top concern. “Other countries, in particular countries that are very significant for the U.S. defense posture, like the Pacific Island countries, really care about climate change a lot. They want to hear what the United States is willing to do to help them deal with climate change,” says Moore. “And so when you have the instructions to essentially ignore climate change, or in an extreme version almost censor mention of climate change, that's going to have a harmful effect on diplomatic engagement with some pretty important countries.”\n\nAnd experts say that removing climate change from the list—and deprioritizing the issue writ large—is only going to leave the U.S. more vulnerable. “This is going to make the administration and national security sector less nimble, because they might not have the people, the plans, the policy, [and] capacity in place when disaster inevitably strikes,” warns Nevitt. “You can't just wish climate change away.”",

The situation has prompted emergency declarations in both states, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several counties. The wildfires come as many continue to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just six months ago. The category 4 storm killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and over 50 in South Carolina. This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas. Associa Cares Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina. American Red Cross The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (SCVOAD)\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.\n\nCity of Walhalla Fire Department\n\nThe city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28.",

        "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Entering 2025, underlying the calm surface of the U.S. labor market were currents of anxiety, dissatisfaction, and stagnation. Companies were taking longer to fill open roles, and a growing numbers of employees were disengaged but staying in their roles out of concern it would be difficult to find something better. Now, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their Department of Government Efficiency have laid off thousands of federal employees. These workers are now re-entering the job market. Plus, companies and employees alike are trying to anticipate the impact of rollicking financial markets thanks to constant changes in tariffs. This economic tumult is bringing the stormy currents of the labor market to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the face of these challenges, many job seekers are turning to new AI-powered apps meant to help them find jobs. But ironically, these tools are likely to exacerbate the present challenges and make it harder, not easier, to find jobs. To understand why AI tools designed to help individuals apply to jobs will make the job market more challenging to navigate, it helps to understand the history of those tools and how companies actually hire people today. AI isn’t a new phenomenon in the job-application process. Its mainstream use began on the employer side when companies deployed AI-powered tools in the 2010s to filter through the hundreds of job applications they were receiving for open online job postings. The AI tools baked into these applicant tracking systems—software that companies use to manage the hiring process—looked for matches between the words on incoming resumes and those in job descriptions. If there was enough of a match, then a job seeker’s resume likely made it through the filter.\n\nOn its face, this seemed to offer an advantage to companies over job seekers. In reality, although companies did use these tools to winnow their hiring funnels, most actual hires weren’t made from the pool of people applying online without a connection to the hiring manager. Instead, despite the democratization of job postings online, estimates suggest that well over half of jobs—and perhaps as high as 85%—are still found through personal connections. This is due in no small part to a lack of trust that job seekers and companies have in each other when interacting online. Online job descriptions today have become a long list of skills, qualifications, and platitudes about work style and culture cribbed from past job descriptions, competitors’ postings, and requirements for pay and title grading at the desired level of the role. They have become so vague and meaningless that roles can be impossible to fill as described. Think of the myriad entry-level postings that call for “two years of experience,” for example. Or all the job descriptions that require college degrees—even when current employees in the same roles lack them. Indeed, if you peruse enough job postings, you sometimes get the feeling that employers are seeking employees who do not exist.\n\nSimultaneously, as AI-powered applicant tracking systems sort out individuals that don’t match the desired skills, experiences, and characteristics listed in these job descriptions, prospective employees have learned to embellish their resume and make themselves look like superheroes. In order to get past AI-powered gatekeepers, it has become common for applicants to exaggerate their experiences. This cycle has generated mistrust in the resumes and cover letters coming in from the internet. As a result, managers often prefer to source candidates through a referral they can trust from someone they know. Sure, that might mean it takes longer to fill open roles. But the delay can be worth it from a company’s perspective if it results in a better match. The consequence of this dynamic is that as job seekers begin using AI tools to apply to jobs online, it’s unlikely to help them. It’s actually likely to send the job market into an AI-driven hiring doom loop—the result of which will be employers relying on their personal networks for hiring even more.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Canva, 45% of global job seekers use AI to create and fine-tune their resumes and cover letters. And a growing number of job seekers are doing something more radical: They are using AI-powered tools like LazyApply and JobCopilot to apply directly to open jobs on their behalf. But unfortunately, positive experiences with these AI-powered apps tend to be the exception, not the rule. As more job seekers leverage these automated application tools, it may become even more difficult for job seekers to find a job online because they will flood hiring managers with more applications than they could ever consider. Employers that were receiving hundreds of applications for open roles already tell us that they now receive thousands. With even less trust in the AI-tailored resumes pouring in, companies are likely to rely on personal connections even more to help them find employees.\n\nHiring processes that overly rely on personal connections creates problems—both for companies and job seekers. Companies seeking to boost the diversity of their funnel by gathering large numbers of applicants will likely continue to end up with new hires in similar social circles as their existing employees. Network-based hiring has downsides for job seekers as well. If getting a job is all about who you know, those with limited networks are often left out. As Harvard University’s Raj Chetty’s Opportunity Insights research has shown, networks are strongly based in class—particularly at the top. This means that individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds often have significantly fewer high-income connections. And given the number of jobs filled by who you know, that means that low-income Americans are less connected to higher paying opportunities in the workforce. If these personal connections become even more important when looking for a job, individuals must beef up their networks—not just on social media or with AI bots, but in real life.\n\nTo be sure, networking can “feel dirty,” but as AI makes the job search process more difficult, it will be increasingly critical. So what to do? Rather than connecting with a potential member of your network with the explicit goal of asking for a job, make a habit of being curious about the work other professionals do. Talk with people who hold roles that interest you to learn about what they do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis. The focus, in other words, should be about learning and growth. Over time, you will expand your network and learn about the roles that are good fits for you, your unique skills and experience, and the types of work that energize you. The goal should be to become a self-aware individual who understands what opportunities are out there, recognizes what they bring to the table, and demonstrates real interest in others. That will, in turn, set you apart as someone worth recommending by those that others trust—which is something AI can’t do.\n\nMichael B.

        "title": "The Rising Demand For Electricity Is About More than AI",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "How much will AI drive up power demand in the next few years? That’s been the big question at the center of the energy and climate conversation recently. Many analysts have warned that AI-driven electricity usage is expected to more than double in the next five years as consumers and businesses find varied applications for the technology. But others urge caution: not all data centers in the planning process will ultimately be built and AI could become much more energy efficient than it is today.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is a crucial debate—but the full picture is even more complicated. Even if AI guzzles less energy than the zeitgeist suggests, a wide range of electricity demand drivers lurk just around the corner. A report released earlier this week from the International Energy Agency (IEA) gives a sense of the picture: global electricity demand grew by 4.3% last year due to a range of causes that include not just data centers but also electrification of everything from building heating to cooking, along with more air conditioning thanks to record high temperatures, among other things. “We see one very clear trend: electricity growth,” says Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. Widening the aperture of the conversation around future power demand can help prevent us from fixating on a single technology (however transformative it might be), and avoid the risk of overlooking the complex interplay of factors that will shape our energy future—and the challenges and opportunities that will arise from it.\n\nTo understand the nature of electricity demand growth, it’s helpful to break it down by geography. And there’s no better place to start than in emerging markets and developing countries. Electricity demand ticked up 7% in China and by more than 4% in other emerging and developing economies; meanwhile, electricity consumption in the European Union grew by about 1.5%, according to the IEA. Some of that growth is the simple product of expanding economies. More wealth means more electricity use. But a significant portion of the rising demand came from high temperatures—particularly heat waves in India and China—that pushed consumers and businesses to crank up air conditioning. Electricity usage also grew in the U.S. by about 2% last year, according to government data. Unsurprisingly, the most significant source of that growth was new data centers, but other factors contributed, too. Federal programs enacted during the Biden Administration, like the Inflation Reduction Act, have helped boost the country’s advanced manufacturing footprint. That means a wave of new facilities drawing electricity in previously unoccupied land or revitalized vacant facilities. Moreover, today’s manufacturing plants rely more on electricity than they would have a generation ago, when they might have onsite power from fossil fuels.\n\nAnd then there are electric vehicles. Headlines would have you believe that EVs now face an insurmountable challenge in the U.S. market as people aren’t buying as many as expected. That may be true, but the IEA reports that sales actually continued to grow in the U.S. at greater than a 10% clip. In the coming years, increased EV penetration inevitably means greater power demand. There are a few lessons to draw from this story. For one, if you’re betting on an AI-efficiency breakthrough to save the world from an electricity crunch, you’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, we know a range of developments, like more energy efficient language models, could reduce AI’s future electricity demand, but that won’t address all of the other sources of demand. There are also some positive elements that emerge from this story. Most obviously, the IEA says that 80% of new electricity generation globally last year came from renewable energy or nuclear power. That dynamic means that emissions grew at a slower pace than the economy. “If we want to find the silver lining, we see that there is a continuous decoupling of economic growth from emissions growth,” says Birol.\n\nThat’s small consolation at a time when emissions need to not just slow down but actually decline in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. But I see another opportunity that could emerge from this imminent power crunch: we may be forced to finally confront the full range of solutions available to us. Yes, power companies are eagerly trying to build natural gas to meet demand. But they’re building solar power and battery storage, too. And because neither will be enough, companies have rediscovered the value of nuclear power. In these circumstances, demand-reducing technologies like smart grids and demand response are already taking on newfound importance and companies are incentivized to find more energy efficient ways to run their business. That importance should only grow.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Since President Donald Trump has returned to the Oval Office, Social Security—a program which sends retirement and disability benefits to over 70 million people—has been the subject of many conversations. Although Trump initially assured voters that Social Security wouldn’t be touched, there have since been reports of potential staff and office cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A new policy by the Social Security Administration (SSA) was announced on March 18, with a plan to enforce online and in-person identity proofing as opposed to that which can be done over the phone. This was an attempt to “implement stronger identity verification procedures,” the press release said. The changes were initially scheduled to go into effect on March 31.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, after much confusion and backlash, the SSA backtracked on some of the new measures and also extended the timeline, allowing more time for the system—and Social Security recipients—to prepare for the new identity proofing requirements. Here’s what you need to know ahead of the new Social Security identification policy. What are the new Social Security ID policies? The new SSA ID policy includes a transition to requiring “stronger” identity proofing procedures for both benefit claims and direct deposit changes—identity proofing that can no longer happen over the phone for most beneficiaries of Social Security. Recipients will instead have to verify their identity via an online account, but those who do not have an account will need to prove their identity “in-person” at an SSA field office. People can call 1-800-772-1213 to schedule an in-person appointment. Per the SSA, “the updated measures will further safeguard Social Security records and benefits for millions of Americans against fraudulent activity.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who is leading the charge with DOGE, previously characterized Social Security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” claiming that the program is riddled with fraud and waste. Some experts have stated that the levels of fraud within the Social Security system are not as prominent as the Trump Administration says. During a March 29 interview on MSNBC, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota who serves on the Senate Finance Committee, voiced concerns about the Trump Administration and DOGE’s intentions regarding Social Security. “They’re creating so much chaos and havoc in this system, it’s causing so much anxiety for my constituents and people all over the country,” she said. “I will tell you, I could see my Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee this week, as we were clearing the nominee [Frank Bisignano] for Social Security Administration, reflecting back the anxiety they’re getting from their constituents. But at the same time, are they willing to do anything to stop this? Apparently not.”\n\nDuring Bisignano’s hearing on March 25, Smith declined to ask a question and instead made a statement. “This is a travesty. We can see what’s going on here… this is a wholesale effort to dismantle Social Security from the inside-out. This is not about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse,” she said. Speaking on MSNBC, Smith said Bisignano was “deflecting” during his hearing, and cast doubt on his assurances that he would protect Social Security. Read More: What Is Happening to Social Security Under the Trump Administration and Should You Be Concerned About Yours? Who will be affected by these new policies and who is exempt? The new policy initially drew criticism from lawmakers and advocates who stated that it alienated those for whom it would be incredibly difficult to make in-person visits to SSA field offices—including those in rural communities far away from offices, those with disabilities, and seniors.\n\nAARP, formerly the American Association for Retired Persons, posted a statement, requesting the SSA “rethink” these requirements, pointing out that “requiring rural Americans to go into an office can mean having to take a day off of work and drive for hours merely to fill out paperwork.” During Bisignano’s hearing, he answered questions about these changes from lawmakers worried about the alienation of citizens. Sen. Elizabeth Warren posed a hypothetical scenario to Bisignano in which a senior with a disability has trouble with traveling to a field office and is eventually turned away. She asked him: “Is that a benefit cut?” To which he replied: “I have no intent to have anything like that happen under my watch.” On March 26, the SSA posted an update to these new changes, stating that some people will be exempt from these new rules, allowing people applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare, or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to complete their claim by other means.\n\n“We have listened to our customers, Congress, advocates, and others, and we are updating our policy to provide better customer service to the country’s most vulnerable populations,” Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, said in the update. “Medicare, Disability, and SSI applications will be exempt from in-person identity proofing because multiple opportunities exist during the decision process to verify a person’s identity.” All other beneficiaries who are unable to use the online portal must still visit an in-person SSA office, that includes “people applying for Retirement, Survivors, or Auxiliary (Spouse or Child) benefits.” However, the agency states that this will not be enforced in “extreme dire-need situations.” These extreme scenarios include terminal cases or prisoner pre-release scenarios—though the agency says it is still working on a process that will allow for these cases to bypass the new policy.\n\nRead More: What Is SNAP and What Challenges Is It Facing Under the Trump Administration? When will the new Social Security ID policy go into effect? With the new shift in policy, the update from the SSA announced a delay in the timeline of the new identity proofing requirements, stating the changes will apply to all beneficiaries beginning April 14. This was in part due to an attempt to have more time to train employees. The changes come amid the SSA denying reports that they are closing multiple field offices. “Since Jan. 1, 2025, the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office,” the SSA statement read. “From time to time, SSA must temporarily close a local field office for reasons such as weather, damage, or facilities issues, and it reopens when the issues are resolved.” Still, experts worry that with planned staff cuts, it may be harder for beneficiaries to receive benefits. Pamela Herd, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, told TIME on March 26 that the effects are already being felt.\n\n“People are waiting for hours to get through on the phone and then getting cut off before they can actually talk to a representative. The field offices, that honestly were already a bit overwhelmed [already], are now completely overwhelmed,” she said. “So there's a real disconnect between the statement, ‘I'm not going to cut benefits,’ and in practice, what is going on in the agency.” How to prepare for the new ID policy Those who are not applying for Medicare, Disability, and SSI should prepare for the new ID policy by creating a “my Social Security” account on the SSA website, if they do not already have one. That way, they will not have to provide identification in-person. This option is the “easiest and most secure” way to verify one’s identity, according to the SSA. People can create their account through either one of two credential service providers: Login.gov or ID.me, and they must have a valid email address. For those who are unable to utilize the “my Social Security” account and therefore must go to a field office in-person, the SSA allows for several different kinds of primary and secondary proofs of identity, including a driver's license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to verify your identity.\n\nThe SSA has its own priority list of acceptable identification documents listed online.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. During a closed–door meeting last week, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise gave his fellow Republicans an ice-cold dose of reality: Tuesday’s special elections in Florida, and maybe even the super-pricey Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, were poised to be bad for the GOP brand. In a Florida House district that went Republican by 30 points in November, the Democrat is polling just a few points behind and out-raising his rival by a 10-to-1 margin. In the other House race in that state, a 40-point GOP advantage is registering at about half that rate in early vote numbers. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin race, where Elon Musk is handing out $1 million checks, is a true jump ball.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat’s why Scalise was meeting privately with Republicans last Tuesday to issue this warning: even in a GOP sweep, the election results are going to raise inevitable questions about the fragile GOP standing and the fading power of Trump’s endorsement. Scalise—like leadership-aligned Democrats, speaking candidly—expects the Florida seats to stay red, but the slide is going to be tough to ignore. Here are the players and stakes for all three races. Florida’s 6th District: Randy Fine vs. Josh Weil Back in November, Republican Mike Waltz won re-election in Florida’s Sixth district by 33 points. When he resigned to become Trump’s National Security Adviser, the assumption was the seat was still a safe Republican hold. But a March private poll from a firm close to the Trump White House showed Republican state Sen. Randy Fine ahead by just 3 points, according to Hill aides who have dug into the crosstabs. That was much closer than the 12-point spread in February. It’s a clear sign that the Democrat, Orlando teacher Josh Weil, has effectively tapped into national frustrations with the second Trump term.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been sniping his fellow Republican in recent weeks for running a campaign as though Fine had already won. Trump this past weekend held an eleventh-hour telephone rally to remind his MAGA faithful of his preference, and Musk is rushing in with tens of thousands in new ads. GOP leaders in Washington are well aware that Fine was incredibly late to get his own first ads on airwaves. “I would have preferred if our candidate had raised money at a faster rate and gotten on TV quicker,” Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, House Republicans’ campaign chief, told reporters last week. “But he’s doing what he needs to do. He’s on TV now.” The seat should have been a safe Republican hold—and probably still is, if folks are being honest—but the fact that Democrats are running up the score here is going to raise more grumbling about Trump’s gut-based endorsements, and whether this race is a sign of a bigger problem for the party nationally.\n\nFlorida’s 1st District: Jimmy Patronis vs. Gay Valimont Before he resigned from his House seat in hopes of becoming Trump’s attorney general, Republican Matt Gaetz won re-election in Florida’s First by 32 points. Most strategists describe the First District, which covers the western Panhandle, as the most Republican in the state—a place where Democrats have little hope of tipping the race blue. Yet some Democratic donors are clearly buying the hype that an enormous Trump backlash is in the offing. Gay Valimont, a gun-safety activist who is running for the seat again after getting creamed by Gaetz last year, hauled in more than $6 million through mid-March—a lapping of Republican Jimmy Patronis, by a factor of five. Just as Weil has tried to nationalize his race—wins in both districts could potentially turn the House blue and give Hakeem Jeffries the title of Speaker—Valimont is trying to make her contest as a referendum on checking Trump’s power. Where Weil is still making the race about his opponent, Valimont is very much running directly against Trump and racing right past Patronis, the state’s CFO. Still, both Democrats are hoping to ride the national mood on opposite sides of the state.\n\nDemocratic donor-advisers have taken the pair of races as symptoms of what happens when activists are taken in with races that carry plenty of symbolism but no viable path to victory. But here is the surest signal that these races are not priorities for anyone with real power in the Democratic Party: House Democrats’ official campaign arm is not playing in either race in Florida. While some, like Jeffries, have cut checks as signs of support, the major spigot of cash has remained closed. Wisconsin Supreme Court seat: Susan Crawford vs. Brad Schimel State judicial races rarely draw big spending. Yet some estimate the money to decide who gets a single seat on Wisconsin’s highest court will top $100 million, with $20 million alone coming from Musk. To put that in perspective, the average cost per winning U.S. House campaign in the last midterm elections was roughly $2.8 million. Wisconsin has emerged this century as the most unlikely of high court battlegrounds. The state’s politics, perhaps as much as any of its neighbors, has had a massive reset of alignment. What was once a safe GOP harbor for the likes of former Gov. Scott Walker gave way for a rising union machine, but it still allowed GOP Sen. Ron Johnson to win re-election over one of the 2022 cycle’s rockstar candidates, Mandela Barnes.\n\nPut simply: a bet on Wisconsin’s political DNA in the coming years is a gamble that only fools would take. That’s why, just Sunday night, Musk was on Wisconsin stage tossing an autographed cheesehead hat into the crowd. The race is rocketing to new levels of spending, putting it on par with marquee Senate races and surpassing what even some presidential bids collect. The stakes include workers’ rights, voting rights, and abortion rights as the winner will decide which team prevails on a 4-3 state Supreme Court. The plum political prize, of course, will be deciding how congressional districts are drawn, perhaps giving this parochial court a major say in which party—and its preferred Speaker—gets to run the U.S. House. Madison politics has been drawing outsized attention for more than a decade now, starting with a string of union-testing efforts and a recall-palooza that set back a progressive march. The national glare, to those working there, is getting old.\n\nMore recently, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and a Republican legislature have been riding a tense tightrope of governing frailty. The courts have been hanging back, awaiting the results of Tuesday’s balloting. There’s no party ID on the ballots, but it’s clear the party affiliation of the two candidates as they each chase a promotion and a 10-year term. Brad Schimel, a former state Attorney General and currently a Waukesha County judge, is carrying an endorsement from Trump. Dane County Judge Susan Crawford snagged the support of former President Barack Obama. And both candidates have their share of billionaire buddies in their back pockets. Think of the typical boogeymen: George Soros, Dick Uihlein, Musk. Even actor Kevin Bacon has found his way into this tangle of out-of-state donors. But it’s Musk who is topping the ranks and making the race all the more divisive with his visit that passed out $1 million checks like candy and his other efforts to use his money to encourage rank-and-file voters to cast ballots. In a twist, the legality of those moves have made their way to the court currently in play.\n\nTuesday’s election in Wisconsin is the lone statewide contest before voters this year, making it a tempting test case for political nerds. By all accounts, the whole Democratic playbook is making the election a referendum on Musk, the biggest cash source in the race. But it’s also a warning; if the courts are so transparently for sale, can they actually be trusted to be neutral umpires for what’s right and wrong? State Legislative Races Trending Blue All three of these races are coming on the heels of a few legislative races with results that may hint at a larger Trump backlash, or may just be a lot of noise. Observers are prone to over-interpret the results of special elections, to be sure. Often, we’re looking at just thousands of votes cast, when most voters are unaware there is even an election happening. But they can be useful in diagnosing a mood. For instance, after the Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion with the Dobbs decision, the backlash in special elections was immediate and Democrats cruised to a strong showing in the 2022 midterms.\n\nThis time, it seems the MAGA reboot has been sufficient for Democrats to carry around optimism. Take an eastern Iowa legislative district that Trump carried by 21 points in November; in January, the Democrat flipped the seat.\n\nSo far this year, Democrats obsessing over state legislatures—which actually have more day-to-day impact on most voters than any ramblings from Washington—have tracked a nine-point over-performance for their candidates from the voter-registration numbers. Republicans surveying the 2026 map were already seeing a rough road ahead. The Trump factor is only adding a rumble strip.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

        "content": "This March marked the 25th anniversary of the dotcom bust, a moment that serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of valuable lessons as we navigate the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AI, much like the internet in the 1990s, is being hailed as the next transformative technology, with massive investment and sky-high valuations fueling excitement—and speculation. But if history is any guide, it may take longer than many expect for AI to reach its full potential, and there will be both winners and losers along the way.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs the co-founder of AOL, I had a front row seat to the Internet revolution. And I see several key lessons from that era that are relevant to the AI boom today. The lessons from the Internet and how they might inform the AI revolution are starting to become clear. Transformative technologies often take time to mature, but when the right conditions align, adoption can accelerate at an astonishing pace. Policymakers must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible oversight, as premature or excessive regulation can stifle progress. Meanwhile, market dynamics usually favor early adopters, but industry concentration in AI risks limiting opportunities for young startups. Finally, hype cycles are inevitable—overinvestment leads to corrections, but true breakthroughs endure. Together, these insights reinforce the need for strategic and surgical regulation, open access, and a steady hand in shaping AI’s future.\n\nFirst, technology adoption takes time—but when it clicks, it moves fast. While AI may feel like an overnight success, its roots go back more than 70 years. The Internet too, has been in development for more than two decades when AOL became the first Internet company to go public, in 1992. AI has arguably taken longer to fully develop than the internet did, but because the world is now more interconnected, when ChatGPT launched it was able to get 100 million downloads in just three months. By comparison, it took AOL nine years to reach 1 million subscribers. AOL’s first funding round in 1985 was just $1 million; today, some AI startups are raising $1 billion, with not much more than an intriguing idea and an experienced team. Second, AI’s rapid adoption is forcing policymakers to engage earlier than they did with the Internet. Yes, the government played a critical role in enabling the Internet to flourish. Key decisions—such as the breakup of Ma Bell, which spurred competition in telecommunications, and Congress’ decision to open access to the internet to everyone—helped unleash the digital age. But because consumer adoption of the Internet was relatively gradual, the government could initially adopt a “wait and see” attitude, and a “light touch” in terms of regulations, while they monitored how it evolved and impacted our lives.\n\nBut now, there is pressure to move quickly, especially given the “doomsday” scenarios that AI experts are understandably concerned about. So coming to agreement sooner on appropriate guardrails is important. At the same time, we can’t let concerns about what might go wrong lead to stifling regulations that could hobble the many societal benefits of AI, or put at risk U.S. leadership of this highly strategic technology. It will be tricky, but we need to strike the right balance between responsible oversight and fostering continued rapid innovation. Third, during the internet boom, major corporations experimented with the nascent technology, but few took it seriously at first. Many of America’s largest and most valuable companies at the time—like GE and AT&T—dabbled in online strategies, but were not sure it would have broad appeal. Their decision to largely stay on the sidelines created an amazing opportunity for a new generation of companies to emerge, including AOL, Yahoo, and many others. But AI is different. The biggest tech companies, Microsoft, Google, Meta. Amazon, and others—are all in, and there’s now an arms race to dominate AI. This raises concerns for startups. Unlike during the early days of the Internet, the development of foundational AI platforms is largely concentrated in the hands of a few dominant firms. Open-source AI could help increase the likelihood of broader access and innovation. Without it, we risk AI enabling Big Tech to get bigger, and a new generation of disruptive startups could be left behind.\n\nFourth, hype and FOMO will inevitably lead to market corrections. In the late 1990s, the belief that \"the Internet will change everything\" drove sky-high valuations. That belief wasn’t wrong—the Internet did change everything. But not overnight, and not for every company. When the bubble burst, many concluded that the Internet was a passing fad. Even within AOL Time Warner there were skeptics. In reality, the shakeout led to hundreds of companies falling by the wayside, but the strongest companies—Google and Amazon among them—really thrived.\n\nAI is experiencing a similar hop and hype cycle. There’s a frenzy to invest early, reminiscent of the dotcom era, as investors don’t want to miss out on what is undoubtedly the next big thing. But as with the Internet, not every AI startup will thrive; indeed, most won’t even survive.\n\nStill, the technological mega trend is real. The Internet led to a paradigm shift which changed all of our lives. AI will, as well. But fasten your seat belt, because if the dotcom bust is any indication, it will undoubtedly be a wild roller coaster ride.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — The Chinese military announced large-scale drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan on Tuesday that include an aircraft carrier battle group, as it again warned the self-ruled island democracy against seeking formal independence. The joint exercises involve navy, air ground and rocket forces and are meant to be a “severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,” according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command. No operational name for the drills was announced or previous notice given.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nChina considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favor their de-facto independence and democratic status. Any conflict could bring in the U.S., which maintains a series of alliances in the region and is legally bound to treat threats to Taiwan as a matter of “grave concern.” Taiwan's Presidential Office said in a message on the social platform X that “China’s blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS. We strongly condemn China’s escalatory behavior.\" The SCS refers to the South China Sea, the strategic waterway that China claims almost in its entirety. China's navy also recently held drills near Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no warning, forcing the last-minute rerouting of commercial flights.\n\nTaiwan's Ministry of National Defence said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels in the waters surrounding the island in a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday. It added that it had been tracking the movement of the Shandong aircraft carrier since Saturday and that its carrier group had entered into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, a self-defined area tracked by the military. China regularly dispatches military assets into the zone, which China does not recognize, but Taiwanese officials have recently warned that China could launch a sneak attack under the guise of military exercises. “I want to say these actions amply reflect (China's) destruction of regional peace and stability,” said Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo. Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said. On the streets of Taipei, people said the atmosphere was tense but they were more concerned about the economy and developments surrounding the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Chinese Communists spend so much time and effort on these things but most people don't pay much attention,” said Lin Hui-tsung, a noodle seller in the city's Tiananmu district. China's Coast Guard also announced it was conducting a “law enforcement patrol” on Tuesday around Taiwan, its spokesperson Zhu Anqin said. The drills come just two weeks after a large-scale exercise in mid-March, when Beijing sent a large number of drones and ships toward the island. China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the exercises were directed at Lai Ching-te, Taiwan's strongly pro-independence president. “Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a ‘Taiwan independence’ stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a ‘foreign hostile force,’ and has put forward a so-called “17-point strategy ... stirring up anti-China sentiments,” said China’s Taiwan Affairs Office in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.”\n\nIn mid-March, Taiwan’s Lai put forward a 17-point strategy aimed at shoring up Taiwan’s national security. The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency. Lai's words and actions appear to have especially angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose previous attempts at intimidation have had little effect on the Taiwanese public. Those have often been timed in response to expressions of Taiwanese independence, including a visit by then U.S. House leader Nancy Pelosi. China’s PLA also released a series of videos to publicize their military exercise, including one in which they depict Lai as a green parasite “poisoning” the island by hatching smaller parasites. The video shows Lai’s head on the body of a bulbous green worm, with a pair of chopsticks picking him up and roasting him over a flame set over Taiwan.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, seeking to wear down Taiwanese defenses and morale, although the vast majority of the island’s 23 million people reject its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. In recent years, it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises, from sending small numbers of individual fighters and surveillance planes to sending groups of planes, drones and ships. “The PLA organized naval and air forces to practice subjects such as sea and land strikes, focusing on testing the troops’ ability to carry out precision strikes on some key targets of the Taiwan authorities from multiple directions,” said Zhang Chi, a professor at China's National Defense University in an interview with Chinese state television. Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen since 2016, when China cut off almost all contacts with Taipei.\n\n___\n\nWu reported from Bangkok.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — Protesters against billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump demonstrated outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world’s richest man. The protesters were trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk’s role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he has gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. The biggest portion of Musk’s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which continues to run while also working alongside Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter earlier demonstrations that were somewhat sporadic, Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker’s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company’s sales. Read More: Tesla Protest Movement Prepares for its Biggest Day Yet By early afternoon crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media showed protesters brandishing signs such as “ Honk if you hate Elon ” and “ Fight the billionaire broligarchy.” As the day progressed, the protests cascaded around the country outside Tesla locations in major cities such as Washington, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Seattle, as well as towns in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Smaller groups of counterprotesters also showed up at some sites.\n\nElon Musk looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House on March 24, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Brendan Smialowski—Getty Images\n\n“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!” several dozen people chanted outside a showroom in Dublin, California, about 35 miles (60 miles) east of San Francisco, while a smaller cluster of Trump supporters waved American flags across the street. A much larger crowd circled another showroom in nearby Berkeley, chanting slogans to the beat of drums. “We're living in a fascist state,” said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from neighboring Oakland, “and we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.” Anti-Musk sentiment extends beyond the U.S.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protesters at more than 230 locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe were not as large, the anti-Musk sentiment was similar. About two dozen people held signs lambasting the billionaire outside a dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support. One sign displayed depicted Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute — a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, “You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don’t buy a Swasticar.” “We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we’re facing,” said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest. Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker’s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.\n\n“I’m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,” Crockett said during an organizing call this month. Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, showed up at a protest in Seattle, which she represents in Congress. Musk backlash has included some vandalism Some people have gone beyond protest, setting Tesla vehicles on fire or committing other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. In a March 20 company meeting, Musk indicated that he was dumbfounded by the attacks and said the vandals should “stop acting psycho.” Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday’s protests remaining peaceful. But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Teslas in northwestern Germany in the early morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the protests.\n\nIn Watertown, Massachusetts, local police reported that the side mirror of a black pickup struck two people at a protest outside a Tesla service center, according to the Boston Herald. The suspect was promptly identified by police at the scene, who said there were no serious injuries. Musk maintains that the company's future remains bright A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade them in, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from him. But Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in new sales in the March meeting, during which he reassured the workers that the company’s Model Y would remain “the best-selling car on Earth again this year.” He also predicted that Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million currently.\n\n“There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,” Musk said. After Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk’s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars. That optimism helped lift Tesla’s stock by 70% between the election and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE. “This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a recent research note.\n\n—Associated Press writers Terry Chea in Berkeley, California, Mustakim Hasnath in London and Stefanie Dazio in Germany contributed.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Starting March 12, 2025, all steel and aluminum products imported into the United States face a hefty 25% tariff. And last week, President Donald Trump placed a 25% tariffs on auto imports. Both of these moves are part of the sweeping set of protectionist policies the new administration has already imposed in the short time since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The President touts his moves as necessary steps to protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, reviving the rhetoric of economic nationalism that defined his first term.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis moment is not unprecedented. The U.S. has previously embraced a robust industrial policy—including tariffs, subsidies, and direct investment in industrial projects—to bolster the development of specific industries. From 18th century manufacturing strategies to Cold War technology races, these policies have shaped the national economy. Trump’s approach, which uses tariffs on a global scale, introduces new risks, however. Instead of fostering innovation and stability, these policies could fragment the global economy into rival blocs. Industrial policy in the U.S. is as old as the nation itself. Alexander Hamilton, a founding father who advocated for strong federal government and economic modernization, laid out a roadmap for government intervention in 1791 to foster domestic manufacturing. In his Reports on Manufactures, Hamilton envisioned tariffs to protect fledgling industries and subsidies to spur innovation. Notably, the highest tariff rate—15%—was placed on imported firearms and other military weapons, as Hamilton recognized U.S. military dependence on foreign-made weapons as a threat to national security. He also recommended an annual federal purchase of domestic weapons and the establishment of a federal arsenal, which Congress largely adopted in 1794.\n\nThese policies aimed to protect emerging industries and reduce reliance on British imports, an early reflection of how economic independence is often accompanied with geopolitical stakes. And they worked, ultimately contributing to 5% annual growth of industrial output over the following century, allowing the U.S. to achieve self-sufficiency in arms manufacturing and strengthening the nation's ability to defend itself without relying on European powers. Read More: What Are Tariffs and Why Is Trump In Favor of Them? Industrial policy can also exacerbate domestic political divisions, however. In the 19th century, tariff policies designed to protect emerging manufacturing industries in the North deepened regional economic divides. The controversial Tariff of Abominations of 1828 imposed high duties on imported manufactured goods, benefiting the industrial North while harming the agrarian, import-reliant South. Southern leaders argued the tariff unfairly burdened their economy and even attempted to nullify it, sparking the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33.\n\nIn the 20th century, industrial policy evolved into an ambitious tool for both economic and geopolitical advancement. Over the course of World War II, the federal government heavily invested in innovations like radar, nuclear energy, and synthetic rubber. These investments not only helped win the war, but they laid the foundations for America’s postwar economic boom as well. During the Cold War, NASA’s Apollo program was a symbol of what government-backed innovation could achieve as it propelled the U.S economically through technological spillovers in computing, materials science, and telecommunications, while simultaneously affording the United States global political stature by demonstrating technological superiority over the Soviet Union, with the historic achievement of landing humans on the moon. But not every initiative was a moonshot. In the 1960s, the federal government also poured resources into developing a supersonic transport plane. Initially intended as a technological marvel to rival Concorde, the Anglo-French supersonic aircraft, development of Boeing 2707 faced insurmountable technical and economic challenges and was ultimately aborted: a failure of industrial policy to balance ambition with feasibility.\n\nThe U.S. wasn’t alone it its pursuit of these policies. In the 20th century, the Japanese government used a combination of protectionist tariffs and quotas, subsidies, and generous government loans, among other measures, giving rise to national champions like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan that dominated the international automobile market. In response, the Reagan Administration implemented voluntary export restraints (VER), limiting the number of cars Japan could export to the United States. But the real issue for car manufacturers wasn't global trade, but their inability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and improve efficiency. In fact, the VER encouraged Japanese manufacturers to upgrade to higher-value vehicles and establish U.S. production facilities, while American companies gained short-term profits without addressing their uncompetitive cost structures and quality issues. The policy prioritized protecting entrenched domestic producers over incentivizing the innovation needed for long-term competitiveness. In the end, American consumers were left to bear the burden of heightened auto prices, resulting in a national net welfare loss of over $3 billion.\n\nRead More: 'Big 3' Automakers Get Brief Reprieve from Trump's Tariffs Industrial policy took on a new dynamic in the 1990s as a group of liberal policy entrepreneurs argued for aggressively subsidizing \"high-value\" or \"sunrise\" industries that could boost American competitiveness. This push culminated during the Clinton administration, where industrial policy became a keystone of the \"new economy.\" As Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman notes in his book Peddling Prosperity, these policies were designed to offer an alternative to the market-driven approaches of the Reagan years, promising a partnership between the government and businesses to address economic stagnation. Once again though, such efforts, though ambitious, were not enough to help the United States resolve structural issues, such as job losses and wage stagnation, that came with its integration into the global economy. The recent global wave of investment-focused industrial policy surpasses all of these previous efforts in size and scope. Under the Biden Administration, the U.S. committed unprecedented volumes of funding to subsidies for semiconductors and clean energy, aiming to secure supply chains and outcompete China, which has aggressively pursued industrial policy to dominate key industries such as electric vehicles and critical minerals. In response, the European Union’s Green Deal Industrial Plan and Japan’s subsidies for the hydrogen industry reflect similar ambitions in driving the growth of green industries.\n\nAnd yet, these global initiatives have also sparked new protectionist measures to lure industries within their borders, ultimately creating inefficiencies and trade distortions that undermine the economic logic of global value chains. By obsessing over “onshoring” production and abandoning the idea of comparative advantage, nations risk raising costs, reducing productivity, and fragmenting the international division of labor that has brought decades of economic benefits through specialization and economies of scale.\n\nProtectionism is expected to only gain stronger and stronger momentum in the United States under Trump. Within the first couple of months of the new administration, Trump has imposed or promised to impose a wide range of tariffs on U.S. trading partners. China, Canada, and the European Union have already responded with duties on a wide range of U.S. goods covering tens of billions of dollars' worth of trade. Other countries that are hit by tariffs are poised to follow similar retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAs a result, multinational corporations, caught in the crossfire, are forced to operate in heightened policy uncertainty, or restructure supply chains based on political alliances, rather than economic efficiency. Such a shift undermines not only international trade but also the effectiveness of domestic policies, since any American company that sources inputs from other countries may now need to face elevated costs due to the tariffs. Industrial policy, both past and present, has often prioritized short-term political gains over long-term economic growth, leading to inefficiencies and, at times, political instability. But such a unilateral approach to industrial policy, where nations act independently to outcompete one another, has potential consequences: escalating subsidies, retaliatory tariffs, and subsequently fractured supply chains. History shows how shifting from protectionist policies to a collaborative, objective-oriented approach creates a more stable global economic system.\n\nYilin Wang is a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Virginia.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — While most Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump’s handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the conflict is not weighing as heavily on his public perception as it did on President Joe Biden, a new poll shows. That’s because of Trump’s solid support from his base on this issue. The survey of U.S. adults from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 8 in 10 Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of the conflict. Only about 4 in 10 Democrats approved of Biden’s handling of the conflict last June, shortly before Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“During Trump’s first administration, we did not actively start any wars. And there’s a stark difference between his history and his first term versus the Biden presidency. And I think Trump is just trying to fix things that Biden let get out of hand,” said Patrick Vigil, a 60-year-old Republican from New Mexico who voted for Trump in November's election.\n\nPalestinian girls dressed for Eid al-Fitr celebrations walk next to destructions in Jabaliya, Gaza Strip on Monday, March 31, 2025. AP Photo—Jehad Alshrafi\n\nThe poll suggests Republicans are growing more satisfied with the country’s foreign policy actions as Trump pulls back U.S. support for Ukraine and puts new pressure on allies — notably with his talk of annexing Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal.\n\nTrump has warned Hamas that there would be “hell to pay” if Israeli hostages weren’t returned immediately and urged Israel to wrap up their offensive and “get it over with.” He has supported ceasefire talks in both conflicts and said he’d end the war between Ukraine and Russia within “24 hours” — or even before taking office. Since becoming president again, Trump has publicly torn into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but also tried to pressure Russia's Vladimir Putin to accept a peace deal. Broadly, Republicans are more content with the U.S. on solving global issues now that President Trump is in office. About half of Republicans say the U.S.’s current role in world affairs is about right, up from about 2 in 10 last February when Biden was president. There's a greater consensus that the U.S. should be focused on ceasefire negotiations in Israel and Ukraine than there was last year too. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults say it’s “extremely” or “very” important for the U.S. to negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, up from about half in an AP-NORC poll conducted in February 2024, with a similar uptick on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nRepublicans have grown more committed to both foreign policy goals since Trump took office, according to the poll. For instance, about 6 in 10 Republicans now think it's highly important for the U.S. to negotiate a permanent ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, up from about 4 in 10 last year. “I think we really need to step back and figure out a way just to bring everybody to the table so that they can use their own resources and figure out what they need to do to compromise,” said Lisa Major, 61, a registered Republican from Kentucky who voted for Trump in November. Keith Willey, a Republican-leaning registered independent from Florida who voted for a third-party candidate for president, said peace deals in Ukraine and Gaza have become more important to him over time amid mounting death and destruction. But Willey said he doesn’t support a deal that allows Hamas to stay in control in Gaza and he doesn’t support a ceasefire in Ukraine that divides it up with Russia or hinges on the U.S. taking control of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.\n\nHe still supports strong American intervention on Ukraine’s behalf against Russia, supports strong U.S. backing of Israel and doesn’t like Trump’s friendly relationship with Russia or Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I’m not tired of giving weapons to Ukraine. I think we should support where we can to have them fight for their own country. But, generally speaking, I would like to see a ceasefire,” Willey, 63, said. Many Republicans don't want more investment in Ukraine, though — only about 2 in 10 think providing aid to Ukraine's military to fight Russia is “extremely” or “very” important — and not all of Trump's voters are satisfied with Trump's ceasefire efforts. Michael Johnson, a 36-year-old registered independent from North Carolina who voted for Trump, isn't happy with Trump's handling of Israel's war in Gaza or the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Johnson said Trump had held himself out as a president who could bring the wars to an end quickly but hasn't.\n\n“I don’t think he went through with what he said he would do,” Johnson said. “He said he would stop it, but it’s still going on. There’s a lot of people losing their lives out there, young kids and stuff.”\n\nAnd many Republicans want Trump to continue shrinking American involvement abroad. About 4 in 10 Republicans now say the U.S. should take a less active role in world affairs.\n\nThat includes Major, who supports Trump, likes how he’s handling foreign conflicts and sees him trying to reduce the role the U.S. plays in the world, as she wants him to do.\n\n“For one, it takes our attention off of the citizens of America, but also it may be sending a really negative message where we keep involving ourselves in other people’s issues when we can’t figure out our own issues,” Major said.\n\n___\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,229 adults was conducted March 20-24, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

        "title": "Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face.\n\nWhen I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point.\n\nAfter her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.”\n\nThe 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

Instead, as the televised briefing began, Zelensky reached for another one of his gifts. It was a folder containing a series of gruesome photographs, showing Ukrainian prisoners of war after their time in Russian captivity. Some of their bodies were grotesquely emaciated. Others showed signs of torture. “That’s tough stuff,” Trump said, his face leaden, as he took the photos from Zelensky and began leafing through them.\n\nThose pictures, according to some U.S. officials, marked the point when the meeting went wrong. Had Zelensky offered the championship belt, the gesture might have lightened the mood. The photos had the opposite effect. They seemed to get Trump’s guard up, as though he were being blamed for the suffering of those soldiers. Still, even today, Zelensky does not regret his decision to present these images. He had been trying to reach beyond Trump’s transactional instincts, beyond his need for flattery, and appeal to Trump as a human being. “He has family, loved ones, children. He has to feel the things that every person feels,” Zelensky says. “What I wanted to show were my values. But then, well, the conversation went in another direction.”",

        "content": "Employees across the massive U.S. Health and Human Services Department began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday in an overhaul ultimately expected to lay off up to 10,000 people. The notices come just days after President Donald Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government. At the National Institutes of Health, the world's leading health and medical agency, the layoffs occurred as its new director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, began his first day of work.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan last week to remake the department, which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, and monitoring the safety of food and medicine, as well as for administering health insurance programs for nearly half of the country. The plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America. The layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. At the NIH, the cuts included at least four directors of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers who were put on administrative leave, and nearly entire communications staffs were terminated, according to an agency senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.\n\nAn email viewed by The Associated Press shows some senior-level employees of the Bethesda, Maryland, campus who were placed on leave were offered a possible transfer to the Indian Health Service in locations including Alaska and given until end of Wednesday to respond. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington predicted the cuts will have ramifications when natural disasters strike or infectious diseases, like the ongoing measles outbreak, spread. “They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,” Murray said Friday. Beyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related money. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost money, “some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nUnion representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated. The department’s leadership will target positions in human resources, procurement, finance and information technology. Positions in “high cost regions” or that have been deemed “redundant” will be the focus of the layoffs. Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient “sprawling bureaucracy” in a video Thursday announcing the restructuring. He said the department’s $1.7 trillion yearly budget, “has failed to improve the health of Americans.” “I want to promise you now that we’re going to do more with less,” Kennedy said. The department on Thursday provided a breakdown of some of the cuts. 3,500 jobs at the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects and sets safety standards for medications, medical devices and foods. 2,400 jobs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors for infectious disease outbreaks and works with public health agencies nationwide.\n\n1,200 jobs at the NIH. 300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid. At the CDC, most employees have not been unionized, but interest rose sharply this year as the Trump administration took steps to reduce the federal workforce. Roughly 2,000 CDC employees in Atlanta belonged to the American Federation of Government Employees local bargaining unit, with hundreds more who had petitioned to join in recent days being added. But on Thursday night, Trump signed an executive order that would end collective bargaining for a large number of federal agencies, including the CDC and other health agencies. The erosion of collective bargaining rights was decried by some Democratic lawmakers. “President Trump’s brazen attempt to strip the majority of federal employees of their union rights robs these workers of their hard-fought protections,\" Reps. Gerald Connolly and Bobby Scott, both of Virginia, said in a joint statement Friday.\n\n“This will only give Elon Musk more power to dismantle the people’s government with as little resistance from dedicated civil servants as possible — further weakening the federal government’s ability to serve the American people.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Amanda Seitz and Matthew Perrone in Washington and Mike Stobbe in New York contributed.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Despite a last-minute save by President Donald Trump in January, the fate of TikTok remains murky as the deadline to save the app approaches. TikTok, which boasts more than 170 million users, has been under fire by U.S. legislators over concerns about data privacy and national security. In order to save the app, Trump gave the social media site until April 5 to divest and find a U.S.-based owner. Under his previous term, Trump was the acting force seeking to ban TikTok in the U.S. But the President seemed favorable towards the app following his election win, citing it as part of why he secured support from young voters.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"We have a lot of potential buyers,\" Trump said on Air Force One Sunday. \"I'd like to see Tiktok remain alive.\" Trump indicated that he would extend the deadline if a deal was not finalized. China has indicated that it would not support the forced sale of TikTok. The latest tussle is just the most recent development in the long legal battle to keep TikTok available in the U.S. Efforts to ban TikTok in Montana were overturned by a federal judge in 2023 after creators filed suit against the state. TikTok did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment. Here’s what to know. Who currently owns TikTok? TikTok is owned by its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance. Sixty percent of the company is owned by investors including Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group, according to TikTok’s U.S. Data Security page. The remaining 40% is divided between ByteDance employees and the founder of ByteDance.\n\nTikTok is not available in mainland China and has headquarters in Los Angeles and Singapore. But its parent company does have to comply with Chinese law because it operates other video first platforms such as Douyin, the Chinese-equivalent of TikTok. The Chinese government therefore has a “golden share” of one of its subsidiaries, Douyin, owning about 1% of that app. Why is the U.S. banning TikTok? Congress passed a TikTok ban as part of a foreign aid supplemental package, citing national security concerns. Lawmakers were particularly concerned that the company could share data with the Chinese government or interfere with users’ algorithms in a way that would benefit the foreign government. Chinese national security laws require any companies or organizations to cooperate with the country’s national intelligence efforts. “Congress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,” Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell said in April 2024. “Congress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.”\n\nAlready, the app is not permitted on any government-owned devices in the U.S. Other countries, including India have banned TikTok for all users since 2020, while Australia and Canada similarly forbade TikTok from operating on any devices issued by the federal government.\n\nWhat can Trump do to extend the deadline?\n\nThe current April 5 deadline was issued via Executive Order. Trump could possibly issue another such order to extend the deadline.\n\nCan you still use TikTok if it is banned?\n\nThe last time the app was banned, U.S.-based users were unable to comment, share, or view any videos. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now,” a message on a gray background read during the one-day TikTok pause.\n\nEven when the app was restored, TikTok was unavailable for download on the Apple and Google Play stores until mid-February.\n\nIt is unclear whether another potential ban would function similarly to the previous one.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Jan. 28, 1986, was a day that changed Rashid Johnson. He remembers the TV set being rolled into his elementary-school classroom in Evanston, Ill.He remembers watching with his classmates as the space shuttle Challenger flew into the air and transformed into a stream of white cloud. “I remember how that affected my thinking, recognizing that failure was possible amongst adults, amongst folks who we were supposed to trust,” says the artist, sitting in his spacious Brooklyn studio, surrounded by works that are being prepared for a massive midcareer survey at the Guggenheim in New York City. “That was a big one for me.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSeeing the footage of Rodney King being beaten by police in Los Angeles in 1991 also loomed large in Johnson’s life, as well as the acquittal of those officers of any wrongdoing, and the riots that followed. “I was in my young teenage years at that point,” says Johnson, now 47. “And becoming aware of the angst and anxiety and frustration of Black folks in America against the backdrop of what absolutely felt like incredibly unfair decisionmaking by the collective.” The artist has lived through joyous moments in history too—two days before the Challenger explosion, the Bears won their first and only Super Bowl—but it’s the alarming ones that made the biggest impression. “I was an anxious kid,” he says. “I think what we’re exposed to at different stages in our lives absolutely informs how we see the world.” Johnson has spent his career exploring, via his hands, what it means to be unsettled and what it means to be Black and what it means to be male and what it means to be Rashid Johnson, using whatever medium he finds inspiring at the time. His artworks, which include paintings, sculptures, mixed-media assemblages, mosaics, photographs, and film, are full of mood and foreboding. There’s beauty, humor, and exuberance as well. But it is the anxiety, especially as represented by a square-headed figure with whirlpool eyes and a frantically scribbled mouth, for which he is best known.\n\nThese days Johnson manages his anxiety in many ways. He’s extremely punctual. He works out daily. He goes to the Russian baths a couple of times a week. He has given up alcohol, is a regular at AA meetings, and frequently deploys the Serenity Prayer. He recently decided that he can trust the things he can’t control to God. Even so, as we speak he breaks out a packet of high-end Daneson toothpicks and chews on one. “This is born of an oral fixation after I quit smoking six years ago,” he says.\n\nErik Tanner for TIME\n\nHe also works that anxiety out through his art, in series with such titles as Anxious Men, Broken Men, Anxious Red, Surrender Paintings, and Bruise Paintings. The first of these was made in 2014, during the Black Lives Matter protests. He was a father by then and newly sober, so his reasons to worry increased just as he cut off access to his go-to liquid soothers. “I was thinking about my anxiety,” he says, “and kind of almost humorously depicting this character of anxiety, or trying to illustrate what anxiety might look like, through a set of wild gestures.”\n\nThe motif became newly relevant during the pandemic amid the stay-at-home measures and the increase in police-brutality videos that surfaced after George Floyd’s murder. “When people were taking ownership of it,” he says, “I began to make crowds and groups of anxious men, because I recognized that it was a collective position.” Now the Anxious Man has become one of his signatures. And like Keith Haring’s Radiant Baby or Jean-Michel Basquiat’s crown, it has attained totem status; it’s on T-shirts, plates, and jewelry. Not only does Kendall Roy wear a $30,000 dog-tag pendant with the image on it during his “progressive” phase in Succession, the actor who plays him, Jeremy Strong, owns another version of the necklace, with his daughters’ names and birthdays engraved on the back.\n\nOne thing Johnson has rarely had to worry about is critical or commercial support. His solo show at the Guggenheim, “Rashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” opens April 18, and will feature some 25 years of work, including photos he took in his early 20s, which were selected for Thelma Golden’s seminal “Freestyle” show at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2001. He has pieces in galleries and public spaces across the globe and has had solo shows on nearly every continent. His work is prized by collectors and keeps getting more valuable. (In November, a triptych of Anxious Men paintings sold for $2.7 million at Christie’s.) He and his wife, the artist Sheree Hovsepian, have swoon-worthy houses in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park and the beach town of East Hampton. On the day TIME visits his studio, he is wearing a $4,000 cashmere tracksuit and a $200,000-plus Rolex Daytona Le Mans, which isn’t even his fanciest watch.\n\nGolden exhibited Johnson’s photographs of homeless men, which he’d printed using a 19th century technique known as Van Dyke brown, because she recognized “these deeply intimate and engaged portraits that felt old while they were at the very same time, very new,” she says. “Van Dyke prints often indicate to us a certain sense of historic photography. Rashid, as a young artist, was taking that on in a way that I felt also showed how much he had looked at the history of photography and portraiture as a base.” Golden wasn’t the only person who intuited Johnson’s success early. McArthur Binion, a painter who took Johnson under his wing in the graduate program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, noticed right away that he had all the ingredients to make it big. “You have to have the right brain cells and the right support. Rashid is fourth-generation college-educated, and as a Black person in America, that’s amazing,” says Binion. But it wasn’t just the education. “Pardon my French, but he has balls. He’s smart. He’s good-looking,” says Binion. “He has a level of patience; he allows things to come to him.”\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nBinion used to meet former students at a bar every second Wednesday. At one of those soirées a few years after Johnson graduated, Binion told him he could see his future. “I told him, ‘Next year you are gonna make at least $100,000 from your art.’ And he laughed at me. He said, ‘No way,’” says Binion. “And he made $200,000.”\n\n“I’ve been rewarded in ways that I would never have expected to be rewarded as an artist,” says Johnson, who grew up more or less middle class. His mother Cheryl Johnson-Odim was a history professor and anti-apartheid activist in Chicago and is still a poet, and his father Jimmy Johnson owned an electronics company. “I’m grateful every time a work of mine is acquired,” he says. But he feels no obligation to feed the art market. “I don’t have to pander to that wealth creation.” Things were different when he showed at Nicole Klagsbrun’s Manhattan gallery in 2008. A few days before the exhibit came down, nothing much had sold. The show was mostly photographs from Johnson’s The New Negro Escapist Social and Athletic Club series, faux-historical portraits of sharply dressed Black men one might find in an old-school club lounge, with names that evoke Black history such as Emmett and Thurgood. There was also a crosshair sculpture that referenced the logo of the band Public Enemy.\n\nIt seemed an unlikely venue for a breakthrough. “Nicole was located, like, on the sixth floor of some monster building,” says Mera Rubell, an influential collector and the co-founder of the Rubell museums. “You know, you get off the elevator and walk three miles inside the building to get to a door.” Rubell may be foggy on the location, but she has a crystal-clear recall of what she found behind that door. “We walked in and we said, ‘Wait a minute. How is this possible, that this work is available?’” she says of the visit with her husband and co-founder Don and her son Jason, who works with them. “We just were kind of blown away. This is a talent that we didn’t know, which is what we live for.” They bought six pieces for their show “30 Americans,” which traveled to 17 other galleries, and they put one of Johnson’s photographs on the cover of the catalog. (They now own 22.) There’s never just one big break in an art career, but that was a good-size one.\n\nBoth Golden and the Rubells were drawn in by the work, but what really sealed the deal was meeting the artist. “He’s far more educated and sophisticated than most artists,” says Don, unable to resist jumping in on his wife’s speakerphone call from Miami. Johnson has a serious but friendly way of bringing people into his vision. “I’ve always tried to be really attentive to answering questions,” he says, “so that if there’s an audience in the future and they have the curiosity and the ambition and the enthusiasm to search out what I was thinking about around it, I’d provide the language.” And while Johnson grew up around “wordy people”—his younger sister is also a poet and his older brother is a lawyer—he’s not precious about the way his art is talked about. “I really don’t like the idea that my project, even with all of its diversity and complexity, is opaque,” he says. “I want people to feel agency to talk about it, say what they feel when they see it, and to trust themselves.”\n\nArt handlers hold a painting by Johnson titled Untitled Anxious Audience at Christie's in London on June 20, 2023. Wiktor Szymanowicz—Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nThe Guggenheim is something of a homecoming for Johnson; he served on its board for seven years until 2023. (“While the idea of organizing an exhibition has been in progress for a long time, plans did not proceed until after Rashid’s tenure on the board was over,” says a museum spokesperson.) As he’s revisited his work and figured out how to display it best in the museum’s famous curved ramp, he’s had a chance to reflect on the many paths he’s explored. These paths have included, so far, working with hair lotion, shea-butter soap, wax, shelving, at least one piano, mirrors, tiles, vinyl records, and old wooden floors as well as such conventional art products as oil paint and canvas. “My interests happen to consider both the aesthetic sensibility of an art object, how it can be rewarding to witness, and how it can be rewarding to think about in a more critical way,” he says. “That dichotomy is very specific to how I think.”\n\nTake shea butter, for instance. Johnson grew up using the soap in his home. He saw it for sale in Afrocentric stores or on the street. “It became this tool that was understood as a representation of an Africanness,” he says. “But it also has a utility, it moisturizes your body. Some people, historically, would cook with it. So I became really interested in the material, and I found ways to deploy it.” The show is also allowing him to revisit some old ideas, and to play with them. “There’s a body of work called Cosmic Slops that I was making around 2008 that were about incising and the removal of material and how you create lines,” he says. He points to two cream paintings in front of him. “These works, which I’m calling Quiet Paintings, are actually the children of those. They were finished yesterday.” He seems to be relishing the opportunity to get away from just being the Anxious Man. “I’m also a person filled with joy. I have an endless number of positive interactions and family and experiences and things that make me, you know, happy,” he says. “I think the Guggenheim show will kind of amplify that, like, this sh-t to me is sometimes very funny.”\n\nJohnson has the kind of success people dream of. He’s wealthy beyond his wildest imagination. He has enough influence that he can—and does—shine a light on other artists. He and his L.A. art dealer David Kordansky have resurrected the careers of several overlooked Black artists, including Sam Gilliam before he died. But asked when he knew that he was going to make it as an artist, Johnson can’t quite get there. “I’ve always been a person who aspired to the freedom of the idea that I would at some point have the resources and enthusiasm of an audience that would allow me to do this in perpetuity. That’s absolutely something I aspire to,” he says. “I think I’m getting closer.”\n\nCorrection, March 31\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the opening date of Johnson's show at the Guggenheim. It is April 18, not April 16.",

        "title": "The Emotional Ending of 'When Life Gives You Tangerines'",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the final episode of When Life Gives You Tangerines, Netflix’s slice-of-life K-drama, protagonist Ae-sun (played here, in her 70s, by Moon So-ri) tells daughter Geum-myeong (played here, in her 40s, by IU): “Getting old is nothing special. You feel the same on the inside, but when you look in the mirror, you see an old woman. That’s all aging is.” As a line of dialogue out of context, it is a valuable and perhaps relatable observation. In the final act of a TV series that has just spanned 70 years over the course of 16 masterfully executed episodes, it is devastatingly profound.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe know what Ae-sun says is true because we have lived those decades alongside her, seeing how life’s joys and pains still cut the mother, wife, and poet just as deeply as they did when she was young. Here’s how one of the best K-dramas of the year so far tied up its tapestry of Korean modern history, Jeju culture, and one family’s dreams in its emotional conclusion. Does When Life Gives You Tangerines have a happy ending? In the final episode of When Life Gives You Tangerines, the precious agony of being alive is borne out in the death of Gwan-sik (played predominantly by Park Hae-joon in these final episodes), Ae-sun’s beloved husband and Geum-myeong and Eun-myeong’s dad. Gwan-sik has been by Ae-sun’s side since they both were young, when he would bring fish from his own family’s table to feed a neglected Ae-sun. Together, they have lost a child, and raised two more to adulthood. They are grandparents and beloved members of the community, and they’ve done it all side by side.\n\nAs he’s dying, Gwan-sik apologizes for not being able to make Ae-sun’s life easier, but she reassures him: “Thanks to you, I was never lonely for a day.” She doesn’t regret choosing to marry Gwan-sik over someone like Bu Sang-gil (Choi Dae-hoon), whom she was briefly engaged to in her youth. Sang-gil was rich in resources but lacked loyalty or affection. The woman he ended up marrying, Yeong-ran (Jang Hye-jin), divorced him as soon as she had enough economic independence, after raising their four children. Throughout the series, we see the contrasts between Gwan-sik and Sang-gil: While Gwan-sik is a devoted husband, Sang-gil is a philanderer. While Gwan-sik sells his boat to get son Eun-myeong out of jail, Sang-gil never went to any of his kids’ school events. Sang-gil begins to learn and change his ways later in life, but Gwan-sik is depicted as being decades ahead of him in the talent of caring for those you love. In a time when patriarchal family and societal structures allowed men like Gwan-sik and Sang-gil power over their wives and daughters, Gwan-sik chose to love Ae-sun rather than to control her. For Ae-sun, it’s a happy ending. All love must end in a farewell, but Ae-sun doesn’t regret taking Gwan-sik’s hand and never letting go.\n\nIU as Oh Ae-sun, Park Bo-gum as Yang Gwan-sik in When Life Gives You Tangerines Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWho does Geum-myeong marry? While many K-dramas play into the romantic concept of one true love, When Life Gives You Tangerines subverts the trope in its depiction of Geum-myeong’s romantic life. The daughter of Ae-sun and Gwan-sik meets her first love, Park Yeong-bum (Lee Jun-young). at Seoul National University, fall in love, and date for seven years. They plan to get married, but Geum-myeong eventually decides against it because Yeong-bum’s mother treats her poorly, thinking Geum-myeong and her working class background are not good enough for her son. When Geum-myeong sees how much her future mother-in-law’s treatment upsets her parents, who gave up so much to send her to college and to study abroad in Japan, she breaks off the engagement. The decision breaks both Geum-myeong and Yeong-bum’s hearts.\n\nLater, Geum-myeong reconnects with artist Park Chung-seob (Kim Seon-ho). The two met when Chung-seob was dating the daughter of Geum-myeong’s Seoul landlord. At that time, Chung-seob got Geum-myeong a part-time job at the movie theater where he worked painting posters. Chung-seob obviously had a thing for Geum-myeong, but she was devoted to Yeong-bum. Following Geum-myeong’s breakup and Chung-seob’s return from military service, Chung-seob manages to track Geum-myeong down—by literally chasing after a bus he sees her on. They fall in love, and get married. \"The size of the love wasn't different,” Geum-myeong says in voiceover, comparing her two romantic relationships. “The temperature was. It was the temperature that let me be myself. I've found my prince.\"\n\nLee Jun-young as Park Yeong-beom, IU as Yang Geum-myeong, and Moon So-ri as Oh Ae-sun in When Life Gives You Tangerines Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe real history in When Life Gives You Tangerines When Life Gives You Tangerines is the story of one family, but it is also the story of Korea’s modernization from the postwar period to today. The series, written by Lim Sang-choon and directed by Kim Won-seok, is peppered with specific historical detail throughout its run. “They do a great job, although you would have to know the history well enough to know what's going on,” Namhee Lee, a professor of modern Korean history at UCLA, tells TIME of When Life Gives You Tangerine’s use of history as background. In an early episode, young Ae-sun loses the class election, not because she didn’t get enough votes but because the class rich kid brought in treats for everyone. “The class election, in a way, is projected to the larger national history, right?” says Lee, noting that the scene shows a newspaper reporting on the March 1960 presidential election fraud. “The relationship has been made between the kind of corruption that goes on in a very small class to a larger historical event.”\n\nIn the series’ ending, Ae-sun and Geum-myeong’s professional successes are positioned as examples of social progress that was hard-won across generations. Ae-sun, who was not able to graduate from high school or go to college “on the mainland,” despite her cleverness and ambitions, begins publishing poetry in her 60s and 70s. After her husband’s death, she volunteers her time teaching residents of a Jeju nursing home how to read, write, and express themselves through poetry. They call her “teacher,” and it makes her feel good. Geum-myeong, whose family sacrificed so much for her education, becomes a successful early tech entrepreneur. She launches an online lecture business in the hopes of making education accessible to people like her mother, who missed out on college because of factors like social class and geography.\n\nMoon So-ri as Oh Ae-sun in When Life Gives You Tangerines Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe significance of Jeju Island in When Life Gives You Tangerines While some of When Life Gives You Tangerines is set in Seoul, its heart lies on Jeju Island. Jeju is the biggest of Korea’s islands, and it has a rich and distinct cultural history. It has been depicted in previous K-dramas, such as Our Blues, but arguably never with such historical scope and cultural specificity. “I think there is an attempt, at some level, to acknowledge the [cultural] distinctiveness of Jeju Island,” says Lee. In the final episode of When Life Gives You Tangerines, we see the opening of a Haenyeo Museum dedicated to the culture of Jeju’s female divers, which have also been recognized as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. “Haenyeo is usually an embodiment, again and again, of Jeju women being independent,” says Lee. It’s fitting, given When Life Gives You Tangerines’s women-centric depiction of Korean modern history. “In some ways, it's no wonder that this drama is focused on women and is taking place in Jeju.”\n\nRead More: Korean Superstar IU on Starring in When Life Gives You Tangerines Who is editor Chloe Lee? In the only plot-twisty element of the When Life Gives You Tangerines’ ending, the editor of Ae-Sun’s poetry collection is played by Jeon Gwang-rye, who also plays Ae-sun’s haenyeo mother, Yeom Hye-ran. Hye-ran died when Ae-sun was young, and her daughter has never stopped missing her. In the finale, we see a 70-year-old Ae-sun calling out for her mother to the sea, like she did when she was a child. She hopes that her mother has been reincarnated and is working a comfortable desk job, unlike the breath-stealing work of a haenyeo. It is implied that editor Chloe Lee is a reincarnated version of Hye-ran. Though we don’t know who she is until this finale scene, Chloe is seen twice in the series as a child. First, as the daughter of a couple being interviewed on the TV during the Jeju Canola Flower Festival, and later when she and her mother pay Ae-Sun to fillet their squid at the fish market.\n\nThe character also acts as an audience surrogate. Like Chloe Lee, we have lived the story of Ae-Sun through a work of art (and are perhaps shedding tears about it)—in our case, a TV series rather than a book of poems and photos. We too are meant to feel pride that Ae-Sun has managed not only to endure life, but to find joy in it—and that she is finally able to tell her story.\n\nMoon So-ri as Oh Ae-sun and Park Hae-joon as Yang Gwan-sik in When Life Gives You Tangerines Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe meaning of When Life Gives You Tangerines's Korean title, 폭싹 속았수다 As far as English-language titles go, When Life Gives You Tangerines is a solid one. The sentiment of the English-language expression, a play on “when life gives you lemons, make lemonade,” works with a central theme of the K-drama. Many of Ae-sun’s hopes and dreams are not possible, and she must learn to make the best of the options she does have. The English-language expression is tweaked to use tangerine instead of lemon, as tangerines are grown on Jeju and are one of the island’s emblematic exports. The island produces 99.8% of the country’s tangerines.\n\nWhile the English-language title works, the original Korean title, 폭싹 속았수다, has an even more specific cultural context. It is a common phrase in the Jeju dialect of the Korean language that translates to “you have worked hard” or “thank you for your hard work.” Some Korean-language speakers who are more familiar with standard Korean may misinterpret the title as “I was fooled.” “In Jeju dialect, it has a very different meaning,” explains Lee. “I think [the series] is an attempt to acknowledge that distinctive culture and history of Jeju people, and yet, at the same time, to incorporate the story into the larger, general history of Korea.” Thematically, 폭싹 속았수다 is arguably an even more appropriate title for a drama that celebrates the diligent hard work of Ae-sun, Gwan-sik, and many of its other characters across decades of rapid social change.\n\nIn an interpersonal context, the phrase takes on greater meaning in the series’ final episode. Before Gwan-sik dies, he is able to see one of Ae-sun’s poem’s published. It’s dedicated to Gwan-sik, telling him she will be OK after he dies. The poem ends with an expression of immense gratitude that uses the show’s Korean title: “My precious dearest, here’s to all you’ve been through.”",

        "content": "Have you ever lost a loved one who left important words unsaid? Did you wonder if they really loved you, or did you have an argument with them right before they died? As a hospice nurse and the founder of Doulagivers Institute, and as someone who has been at the bedside of over 1,000 dying patients, I know how important it is to say everything you need to say at the end of life. That’s why I recommend that everyone, young and old, sick or healthy, write their own eulogy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday, many are rethinking what a funeral service needs to look like. Some are looking back to older traditions by readopting the practice of home wakes and funerals. Others are creating new traditions, showing that there are so many more ways to celebrate a life well-lived than the conventional options. Turning the traditional eulogy into a personally written goodbye can be an empowering and beautiful way to say “I love you” one more time. A eulogy is usually a heartfelt tribute that someone else delivers at the funeral or memorial service. Sometimes, it’s a family member or close friend, but often, it’s a clergy member who may not even know us well. As a death doula, I’ve attended many funerals. But I have never felt more love and healing at one than when a first-person eulogy is read. It’s powerful. Everyone in the room feels they get to have one last conversation with the person they’ve lost. When that conversation is filled with love, it’s the best possible salve for grief. It doesn’t mean others can’t say their own eulogies, but there’s something special about hearing directly from the person everyone misses so much.\n\nRead More: What a Hospice Nurse Wants You to Know About Death When you write your own eulogy to be read after you’re gone, it’s wonderful to know that you’ve left behind a message for everyone you love to help them get through the loss. Even if you aren’t ill and even if you’re still young, you will feel a sense of relief in knowing your eulogy is ready just in case. Of course, none of us wants to think about our death. It can be scary. But I've learned that we can release some of that fear by taking back our control—when we take care of our final plans in advance, we can feel more at ease and at peace, rather than afraid of the unknown. It can also be an opportunity to communicate life lessons you’ve amassed along the way, especially if you’re leaving behind young children or grandchildren. I know someone who wrote about working too much in his younger days before he finally learned that it was more important to spend valuable time with his family. He talked about this in his eulogy, recounting some of the memories he had with his children, wife, and parents that he wouldn’t have had if he’d been working overtime. It meant less money for exotic vacations, but as he put it, “seeing the Great Wall of China will never compare to watching my five-year-old perform in a kindergarten play.”\n\nA first-person eulogy is the perfect place to say apologies you’ve never been able to say face-to-face and bury the hatchet on any arguments before your death. For estranged relationships or those that ended in conflict, a pre-written eulogy can offer comforting closure. It can turn a sad occasion into a powerful, healing experience. Read More: Let’s Talk About Our Grief Some people use their eulogy as a chance to apologize for their very human shortcomings, assuring their loved ones that they did their best even when they fell short and that they hope the people left behind will be able to remember the good times more often than the painful ones. Most importantly, your eulogy is your occasion to express your caring and appreciation for the people you love. You can let them know how important they have been to you, what you admire about them, and what they’ve done for you that has been enormously valuable in your life. Even if you’ve already said it to them directly, saying it to them one more time after you’re gone will be enormously meaningful to them.\n\nIf you have children, telling them how proud you are will stay with them forever. I recommend being specific about it. Speak to each child about their individual strengths that you admire, and provide encouragement and confidence that they can take with them. It’s your opportunity to tell them how much you believe in them and the life they can create, despite whatever challenges they might have experienced. If your child is struggling, this can be a remarkable boost for them as they grieve.\n\nYou can’t always count on being able to say goodbye to those you love. Even in the case of a prolonged illness, you might be unconscious or too weak to do it. By writing your own first-person eulogy ahead of time, you get to say goodbye to everyone who has had an impact on you—not just family members and close friends, but also coworkers, mentors, and community members you want to remember and convey your feelings about. When you write while you’re still feeling healthy, you’ll be less likely to forget anyone, and you can always add to the list as necessary. Doing this in advance is an incredibly empowering and comforting experience that will allow you to leave nothing unsaid.",

        "title": "What We Must Understand About the Dark Enlightenment Movement",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti liked automobiles, particularly his four-cylinder Fiat sports car. For him, the car represented innovation and vitality, even violence. Most of all, it signified the future. An Italian poet, performer, and pamphleteer, Marinetti was a reactionary; he loathed egalitarianism and democracy. He also wasn’t a conservative in any traditional sense, for there was little that he, and others in the Futurist art movement that he founded, wished to conserve. In his 1909 treatise, Founding and Manifesto of Futurism, he wrote, “We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.” A precursor to the fascism that would envelop Europe, Marinetti was an influence on Benito Mussolini, and that ideology, which would soon fulfill that dark promise of destroying Europe’s museums, libraries, and academies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMarinetti’s stronghold over Mussolini has striking parallels to America today—particularly with the rise of the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and its most vocal steward: software engineer and blogger Curtis Yarvin. Largely ignored by academic philosophers, the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and Yarvin have curried favor and influence with tech executives in recent years. A software engineer by training, Yarvin has become a kind of official philosopher for tech leaders like PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Mosaic founder Marc Andreessen. Not unlike the Futurists, Yarvin advocates for replacing democracy with a kind of techno-feudal state—for the government to be run like a corporation, with the president as its “CEO.” This new system is elitist—“humans fit into dominance-submission structures” Yarvin wrote in 2008; and it’s authoritarian—“If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia,” he said in 2012. There are shades of Yarvin’s philosophy in Thiel’s 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, where he wrote “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” And Thiel, through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in the blogger’s startup company Urbit. As for Yarvin’s controversial opinions and whether or not Thiel holds them, Yarvin has said that his patron is “fully enlightened,” as he had been “coaching Thiel.” What’s more, in a recent interview with the Hoover Institution, Andreessen quoted Yarvin and called him a “friend.”\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is that Yarvin’s outsize influence on tech executives has now made its way to Washington. The signs are everywhere: Yarvin was a feted guest at Trump’s so-called “Coronation Ball” in January 2025. Vice President J.D. Vance, a protegee of Thiel’s, spoke admiringly of the blogger’s influence on his thinking when interviewed on a podcast in July 2024. And while Andreessen’s role in the Trump White House is unofficial, The Washington Post reported in January 2025 that the executive “has been quietly and successfully recruiting candidates for positions across Trump’s Washington.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, though not outwardly tipping his hat to Yarvin, seemingly has a similar philosophy: In 2020, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that the “government is simply the largest corporation.” Five years later, Musk has been using his position as an unofficial advisor to the second Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to operationalize what Yarvin has called “a hard reboot” of the government.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington As such, it behooves us to be more familiar with Yarvin and other associated figureheads of this far-right philosophy. Understanding their motivations is essential to understanding what the stakes currently are—and how history can repeat itself. Much can be gleaned about the attractions of this ideology to many of those in power from simply parsing the name of the movement. “Dark Enlightenment” portends the upending of the liberal order that has defined democratic aspirations for nearly three centuries. Where the Enlightenment promised liberty, emancipation, equality, and solidarity, “Dark Enlightenment” offers servitude, hierarchy, bondage, and ruthlessness. The movement is most often associated with the British philosopher Nick Land. Land was a founder of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom until 1995 when his own increasingly erratic behavior had him expelled. Land is actively anti-democratic, desiring a system where great men (guided by algorithms and artificial intelligence) steer the ship of state. This is an explicitly nihilistic vision—“Nothing human makes it out of the near-future,” wrote Land in 1994—an ideology combining technological utopianism with deep misanthropy, a variant of what the historian Jeffrey Herf described as “reactionary modernism,” but which we might as well call cybernetic authoritarianism or technological fascism.\n\nThis leads us to Yarvin. A polemical blogger, Yarvin wrote for years under the goofy name “Mencius Moldbug” where he advocated for his own form of techno-authoritarianism in opposition to democracy. Like Marinetti, Yarvin expressed disdain for those symbols of American culture that he sees as oppositional to “Dark Enlightenment”—from free voting to free inquiry, a vibrant media to the open university. Yarvin, writing in 2021, posited (with significantly less poetry than the Futurists), “Because the university is the heart of the old regime, it is absolutely essential to the success of any regime change that all accredited universities be both physically and economically liquidated.” Yarvin speaks disparagingly of something that he calls “The Cathedral,” a nexus of educational, media, and nonprofit organizations that he believes sets the tenor for discourse, but that also impedes the liberty of executives to do what they will. Rather his aspiration is, as he wrote in 2007, that “the state is simply a real estate business on a very large scale.”\n\nUsing a variety of mixed metaphors, Yarvin advocates for a “Butterfly Revolution,” a “full power start” to the U.S. government accomplished by “giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization.\" This is imagined as an internal coup meant to privatize the government and replace democracy with complete executive authority. Two years ago, Yarvin laid out his strategic program with the acronym “RAGE,” or “Retire all government employees.” Yarvin argued that a hypothetical future Trump administration should terminate all nonpolitical federal workers to have them be replaced by loyalists. The government’s coffers must then be impounded and redirected, according to the blogger. When courts prevent unconstitutional orders, Yarvin says that they should just be ignored. After that, the free press and universities must be curtailed, as well—Yarvin said no later than April after the inauguration.\n\nThat so much of this seems to mirror the actions of the Trump administration and DOGE may not be a coincidence. So far, some 30,000 federal employees—across departments as varied as the FDA, the National Park Service, and the FAA—have been fired by DOGE in the name of government efficiency. Yarvin’s musings in 2009 that the “definition of a sovereign is that a sovereign is above the law,” hold a mirror to Trump’s February tweet that “He who save his country, violates no law.”\n\nYarvin’s claim that “No brand or building can survive” is perfectly congruent with the tech industry’s notorious ethos to “Move fast and break things.” But what’s also being seemingly witnessed is a harbinger of the “monarchism” that Yarvin desires. On February 19, Trump posted a doctored image of himself in a crown with the caption “Long Live the King!” on his social media app Truth Social.\n\nAs is so often the case with Trump, pundits have a tendency to assume a lack of seriousness or intention with what the president says. The same dismissiveness sometimes accompanied the Futurists, and Mussolini’s fascists for that matter, when they were ascendant. Now, as Trump threatens longtime American allies from Panama to Mexico, Canada to Denmark, a belief of the Futurists even more disturbing than their worship of technology should be remembered: Marinetti’s claim that “War is the hygiene of the world.”",

        "content": "What a difference mere weeks have made in Canada. As the new year came and went, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ruling Liberal Party, after nearly a decade in power, were trailing the Conservatives by 25 points—and facing electoral oblivion. An election was due by fall. It was looking like it might come earlier. The opposition parties in the House of Commons were working to bring down the government. Today, Canada is in the midst of that early election, but the circumstances are night and day. Trudeau is gone, replaced by former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. And it was Carney himself who called a snap election for April 28. Most surprising of all, the Liberals are back up in the polls—and now favored to win. And it’s all thanks to a brash American in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe last three months have embodied the old maxim that “events, dear boy, events” can upset the odds in short order. After Donald Trump was elected in November, Canadians became nervous about what his second term might mean for the country. That it wouldn’t be anything good was obvious as early as December when Trump bullied Trudeau, vowed sweeping tariffs, and even threatened annexation to make Canada the “cherished 51st state.” With Trump’s taunts, the pressure on the highly unpopular Trudeau to step aside only grew. Canada needed a new, full-time and focused leader, with plenty of runway to deal with Trump and his bid for hemispheric dominance. So Trudeau announced his resignation on Jan. 6, the date Trump’s win was certified. A short Liberal leadership race followed in March, and Carney became Prime Minister. On Sunday, he called a snap election as voters are rallying around the flag and the incumbent Liberals, and against the Yankee menace.\n\nWith Canada’s economy, defense, and even sovereignty on the line, it’s no surprise that the election is about Trump and who can best handle him—and how. But it’s still a shock to witness the ultra-rapid revival of a Liberal Party that was written off as moribund not so long ago.\n\nIf the Liberals do indeed survive and hold on to power come April 28, they will have Trump to thank—but they’ll also have him to deal with.",

        "content": "The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\n24 March 2025 Share Save Rebecca Treon Share Save\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy\n\nIt's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\n\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\n\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Jalal Antone came up with a twist on a classic sandwich to encourage people to come to his Middle Eastern import store (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\n\nSome of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants – Megha McSwain\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Antone’s po’ boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone’s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\n\nWhere to try Houston's most iconic sandwich\n\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on. Antone's Famous Po' Boys still has two locations in Houston – one inside The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the Heights neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\n\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including H-E-B, Randall's, Kroger, and Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like Baylor and The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Visitors to Houston can find jars of Antone's chow chow in local supermarkets (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot – a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But that's exactly what most of us do when we discard the peel, which makes up around one third of the average weight of the total fruit.\n\nWithin the food industry, there's growing interest in making better use of both the nutrients and the energy in the peel that typically gets thrown away. But there are ways to do this at home too.\n\nPerhaps one of the easiest ways to use up peel are recipes that call for all parts of the fruit, not just the flesh – such as a banana and peel breakfast loaf. Here are five more options for cooking with leftover scraps which are too often thrown away.\n\nGetty Images When we discard a banana peel, we throw away one-third of the edible part of a banana (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nOrange peel - Isabelle Gerretsen\n\nAfter the Christmas holiday, I had a huge bowl of oranges left over, so I thought would try making marmalade for the first time. Marmalade is a breakfast staple in my house – I always start my day with a strong English breakfast tea and a slice of toast slathered in butter and the orange preserve. I found a recipe on BBC Good Food for the \"English classic as made famous by Paddington Bear\" which sounded nice and simple. There were just three ingredients: Seville oranges (1.3kg/2.9lb), the juice of two lemons and a frankly shocking amount of granulated sugar (2.3kg/5.1lb).\n\nI quickly realised that making marmalade is not particularly fast or simple. It took me almost three hours to make two jars and involved quite a few steps, including two hours of simmering the oranges, straining the pulp through a sieve into the juice so that it releases pectin (a naturally occurring starch which helps the marmalade set). I then added in the sugar and the sliced peel and boiled the orange concoction for 20 minutes.\n\nThis clearly wasn't long enough, as while my marmalade looked and tasted great (neither too sweet nor too bitter), it remained very runny – not ideal for spreading on my toast. But I've discovered a lovely new breakfast option: marmalade with Greek yoghurt.\n\nI had a couple of oranges left so I also decided to make candied orange peel, by chopping up peel and simmering it in boiling water for 10 minutes. You have to repeat this process three times and rinse the peels with cold water each time to remove the bitter flavour, before you mix in the sugar and water. The candied orange peel was delicious – the perfect sweet snack. I was also left with a tasty orange syrup which I've been using as a cordial in drinks.\n\nI'm pleased that I've managed to transform my bowl of oranges into four tasty food items: marmalade, candied peel, a glass of juice and the orange syrup. An added bonus is that my kitchen smelled incredible – infused with a delicious orange aroma.\n\nGetty Images Orange peel can be used to make marmalade, a delicious breakfast preserve (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nPineapple peel - Lucy Sherriff\n\nEating a pineapple always feels so wasteful. There seems to be more waste from the core, rinds and top than there's actually fruit. This time I tried putting those rinds to use.\n\nTepache is an historic Mexican fermented beverage that dates back to pre-Hispanic times. Not only does it use all that waste, but it's also a source of probiotics. It's a fun – and easy – recipe to make, but be careful if you're avoiding alcohol because the fermentation process means there is some alcohol present (although usually less than 1%, depending on fermentation times – the longer you ferment the drink, the higher the alcohol content).\n\nI used a one-gallon (3.8 litre) jar, a large elastic band, and a piece of muslin or cheesecloth that is big enough to cover the jar opening.\n\nFirst I washed, peeled and cored one pineapple (an organic fruit lowers the risk of pesticide residues on the skin).\n\nThen I combined water with brown sugar or piloncillo (a traditional unrefined cane sugar from Mexico), in a pan and slowly heated until sugar dissolved. Next, I let it cool slightly, and added the pineapple core and rinds into jar, and poured in the sugar and water mixture while it was still warm.\n\nThen you cover it with muslin, a cheesecloth, dishtowel or kitchen paper – basically you want something to keep the flies out but let air in.\n\nNext, I left the mixture to ferment. I was recommended to keep the tepache between 21-25C (70-78F), and to keep checking on it – after 24-36 hours you should white foam on the top which means it's fermenting. The longer you leave it – the stronger the flavour. Once it was ready, I strained the liquid and refrigerated for a refreshing drink.\n\nTip: You can add ginger, lime, and other fruits for extra flavour. (But if you're adding acid, like lemon or lime, don't add until the mixture is ready as it slows the fermentation process.)\n\nGetty Images Tepache is a historic Mexican fermented beverage that dates back to pre-Hispanic times (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nGinger peel - Lucy Sherriff\n\nGinger peel, too, is frequently thrown away as food waste.\n\nSo if you're not going to discard the peel, how should you use it?\n\nYou can simply use the ginger as normal, with peel attached (in fact, very few recipes specifically say you should use peeled ginger), or you can use the peel in other recipes.\n\nThrow them into a soup to add flavour (but remove before blending or serving). Boil them with water to create a ginger broth, which can be stored in the fridge and added to smoothies, juices, cocktails, sparkling water, or used to steam root vegetables to add an extra kick.\n\nOr for a rich flavour, slow roast the peel in the oven and grind it to a powder (either using a blender with a small grinder attachment or a coffee grinder). You can use this powder to brew a delicious ginger tea – make sure you strain it once it's brewed. The powder can also be used as a spice in cooking and baking.\n\nTip: try using a teaspoon to peel ginger, rather than a peeler.\n\nGetty Images Ginger peel is a rich source of fibre and vitamins (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nButternut squash peel - Jocelyn Timperley\n\nMany recipes call for winter squashes like butternut squash to be peeled before using, but the peel of all squashes is perfectly edible, as are the seeds. Both are a good source of fibre as well as vitamins and other bioactive compounds.\n\nI usually leave the skin on butternut squash but throw away the seeds, as it seems too much of a hassle to have to clean them. But I wanted to try something different, so I decided to try roasting the skin and seeds to make some hopefully crunchy homemade crisps.\n\nI started one evening as I was cooking dinner, using a butternut squash from my local veg box. I washed it thoroughly then dried it, then cut off the top and bottom. Next I used a vegetable peeler and knife to slither off as thin sections of the peel as I could manage (mainly the knife as the veg peeler didn't really work), which took about 10 minutes. I ended up with a mix of different sized pieces that looked ideal for bite-sized crisps.\n\nNext, I cut open the butternut squash lengthwise and scooped out the seeds and surrounding mushy stringy pulp. I popped these and the peels in separate tubs in the fridge overnight, and used the peeled butternut squash to make a squash and paneer curry.\n\nThe next day when I was making coffee and feeling peckish, I separated the seeds from the pulp. I was dreading this part, but they actually came away very easily. I washed the seeds thoroughly then wrapped them up in a clean tea towel to dry. I then repeated this last step after my partner grabbed the tea towel to dry his hands and threw the seeds all over the kitchen floor…\n\nI mixed the seeds and squash skin together in a bowl with some shakes of salt, paprika, smoked paprika, cumin and chilli flakes, then stirred in a few drizzles of olive oil. I cooked the lot using the bake/roast setting of my air fryer at 170C (338F) to avoid burning them and checked on them frequently. After about 20 minutes they were looking nice and crispy.\n\nI was still a bit dubious at this point – but they were delicious. The smaller chips turned out the best as they were super crunchy, and the seeds had an amazing taste. I loved being able to choose which spices I put on them, but I think the ability to use a nice olive oil was what put these miles ahead taste-wise of bought crisps. They would also make a fantastic garnish for soup.\n\nOverall, though, it did feel like a lot of hassle for not a lot of food. Next time I would make sure to separate and wash the seeds ahead of time, and I'd also check on them less now I know how long they need, making this an easier snack. It was useful to use the air fryer, as turning on a whole oven for this amount would feel like rather a waste of energy.\n\nI did really enjoy the final result though, and found it really filling too, and I would definitely use it again for any time I can be bothered peeling a squash. For any tougher peels, it's also worth remembering the peel can be saved in a bag in the freezer along with other edible vegetable leftovers and used to make vegetable stock.\n\nJocelyn Timperley Butternut squash peel can be turned into tasty, crunchy crisps (Credit: Jocelyn Timperley)\n\nOnion peel - Francis Agustin\n\nThe papery skin of an onion is another outer peel we don't typically think twice about before discarding.\n\nI had seen people on social media drying out their onion scraps and grinding them into an onion powder, so I decided to try replicating it. I set aside a portion of the dry outer layer of yellow onion skins for the \"powdering\".\n\nIn short, after a few hours of oven-drying some onions, then throwing them into a food processor, the outcome was disappointing. I ended up adding salt to boost the flavour and then throwing the resulting mixture into a general spice rub where the onion taste was subdued.\n\nFrancis Agustin Orange, yellow and brown pigments can be extracted from onion peels by boiling and used to dye fabric (Credit: Francis Agustin)\n\nAs I had a few more onion skins left, I took a swing in an entirely different direction.\n\nLike many peels or skins, onions contain chemicals called flavonoids, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These flavonoids can be boiled and extracted from the vegetable, producing a potent coloured dye. Tannins (the same type of molecules that give wine a dry taste) are also found in the onion's flaky outer layer, its bitter taste deterring hungry critters. But the same way tannins make wine stains a pain to remove, the tannins in onions make an effective dye for fibres like cotton and linen, which typically need to be primed with a fixative called a mordant to ensure the dye lasts.\n\nFirst, I washed the fabric (I used a clean sock) in a warm water bath to remove any lingering oil or dirt, which could impede the effectiveness of the dye.\n\nAfter airdrying the fabric, I tossed the onion skins into a large metal pot with about two cups of water (adjust dye and water amounts depending on how big the fabric is). On a medium flame, bring the skins to a boil, and keep the solution at a rolling boil for about 15 minutes, until the water turns a dark amber colour.\n\nWhen the fabric is mostly dry, turn off the flame and remove the onion skins with a slotted spoon. Submerge the fabric into the hot dye solution so that it is totally covered and leave for 30 minutes to an hour. Without wringing out the fabric, leave it in a cool area to dry. If the amber colour of the fabric isn't strong enough, repeat the submerging process until reaching the desired colour.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at what this experiment led to, and plan to try it again. My sock came out an autumnal orange colour, but with the use of different types of onions or mordants, fabrics can come out anywhere from a bright mustard yellow to a muted pine green.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

The Bondsman\n\nIn this droll new series, Kevin Bacon adds demon-chasing bounty-hunter to his long list of horror characters. Hub Halloran was a bounty hunter before his murder, but when he lands on the other side, the devil himself gives him a second chance at redemption, reanimating him and sending him back among the living to track down and return demons who have escaped hell. The catch: if he fails at his job he will be called back into the flames forever. In his downtime from hunting demons – they have piercing yellow pupils, the better to identify them – he tries to reconcile with his estranged family. The Bondsman is produced by Blumhouse, the company behind such hit horror franchises as The Purge, so there's reason to believe in this show with a cockeyed premise, which manages to throw in country music.\n\nThe Bondsman premieres 3 April on Amazon Prime internationally\n\nNetflix (Credit: Netflix)\n\n2. Pulse\n\nNetflix contributes to the apparently endless stream of soapy medical dramas with this series about students and residents at a Miami trauma hospital. At the centre is Danielle (Willa Fitzgerald) who is appointed chief resident when the previous chief – inconveniently her ex, Xander (Colin Woodell) – is suspended. But wait! There's a hurricane on the way, so Xander doesn't leave the hospital and together they thrash out their personal issues in between saving lives. Justina Machado (One Day at a Time) plays their boss, the Chair of Emergency Medicine. The terrific Max series The Pitt has proven how well this creaky genre can work, and that show is about to drop its season finale, so Pulse might fill the gap. Just be prepared for evergreen lines like, \"He's going to code!\" and, \"If you go one millimetre too far, she dies!\"\n\nPulse premieres 3 April on Netflix internationally\n\nSarah Shatz/ FX\n\n3. Dying for Sex\n\nOne of Michelle Williams' best performances was as Gwen Verdon in the television series Fosse/Verdon, and here she takes on another rich small-screen role as Molly, a woman diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer, who decides to spend her last months on a no-holds-barred journey to indulge herself sexually while there's still time. Jenny Slate plays Nikki, her best friend and wingperson. The series is based on the Wondery podcast created by Nikki Boyer about her friend Molly Kochan, the real-life inspiration for the show. Jay Duplass plays Molly's husband, Sissy Spacek is her mother and Rob Delaney a neighbour in a series that leavens the drama with comedy. Critics have raved about Williams and the show, with the Observer saying \"the series' comedy never strikes a wrong note\", and The Daily Beast calling it \"a near perfect amalgamation of absurdity and tragedy\".\n\nDying for Sex premieres 4 April on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and internationally\n\nSteve Wilkie/ Disney\n\n4. The Handmaid's Tale\n\nFew shows have had the cultural impact of The Handmaid's Tale. Women protestors in real life have marched in red cloaks, referencing the handmaids in the series' misogynistic state of Gilead and symbolising oppression. The show's plot has long since outrun the Margaret Atwood novel it is based on, and in this sixth and final season June (Elisabeth Moss), having escaped to freedom in Canada, leaves and continues fighting with the resistance. The most chilling characters return, with Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia, Yvonne Strahovski as Serena and Bradley Whitford as Commander Lawrence. This final season will offer \"feel-good episodes\", the series showrunner, Yahlin Chang, told TV Insider. In a recent panel conversation the creators also spoke about this season landing in a political climate that has left them \"bewildered\": \"We need to meet this moment,\" said Whitford. \"Our women are not Marvel characters, they're ordinary women who are doing extraordinary things,\" executive producer Warren Littlefield added, declaring that the show's final message is \"the war is not over, but the fight continues\".\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale premieres 8 April on Hulu in the US\n\nMax (Credit: Max)\n\n5. Hacks\n\nJean Smart is beloved by fans for her Emmy-winning role as Deborah Vance, the old-school stand-up comic who has found a career resurgence with the help of her young writer and frenemy, Ava (Hannah Einbinder). As the fourth season starts, Deborah has realised her dream of hosting a late-night talk show, only to have the ruthlessly ambitious Ava blackmail her way into being named head writer. The relationship between Deborah and Ava – sometimes mentor-mentee, sometimes competitors, sometimes loving and always fraught – is the heart of the series, but its success rests largely on Smart's perfectly acerbic delivery. Julianne Nicholson is among the season's guest stars in a show that comically and deftly addresses big issues including sexism and aging in the entertainment industry.\n\nHacks premieres 10 April on Max\n\nNetflix (Credit: Netflix)\n\n6. Black Mirror\n\nSince Charlie Brooker's dystopian sci-fi series started in 2011, the real world has increasingly caught up to the show, with the mainstream use of artificial intelligence being just the most conspicuous example. The seventh season of the anthology includes, unusually, a sequel. It returns to USS Callister, the show's classic Star Trek homage, with Cristin Milioti (The Penguin) as a computer programmer who finds herself cloned inside a video game. \"Normally I kill off characters at the end of an episode, [but] I kept some of them alive. I'm growing as a human,\" Brooker has said. The other five episodes are crammed with well-known faces, as its zealous fans have come to expect. They include Awkwafina, Paul Giamatti, Emma Corrin, Will Poulter, Peter Capaldi, Issa Rae, Chris O'Dowd, Tracee Ellis Ross and Rashida Jones. Text in the trailer flashes the words, \"Lose Your Mind. Lose Your Reality.\" Let's hope those words don't come back to haunt us in real life, but then Brooker has a way of being just a step ahead.\n\nBlack Mirror premieres 10 April on Netflix internationally\n\nApple TV+ (Credit: Apple TV+)\n\n7. Your Friends and Neighbors\n\nJon Hamm has had some great, attention-getting supporting roles since Mad Men, including the bullying, corrupt sheriff in the most recent season of Fargo and the slick gazillionaire in The Morning Show. But he is once again the main character in this comic drama about Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a rich hedge-fund manager who loses his job and sees his privileged life and identity slipping away. Struggling to keep up appearances and support his ex-wife and their teenaged children, he resorts to stealing jewels, designer bags and other valuables from his friends. Amanda Peet plays his ex-wife, who left him for one of his best friends, and Olivia Munn is his on-and-off fling. The show was created by novelist and screenwriter Jonathan Tropper (This is Where I Leave You). Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) directed the first two episodes of this vibrant series which, in good news, has already been ordered for a second season.\n\nYour Friends and Neighbors premieres 11 April on Apple TV+ internationally\n\nLiane Hentscher/ HBO\n\n8. The Last of Us\n\nOne of the best, most gripping shows of recent years returns for its second season of people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. The story picks up five years after the previous season ended, but Joel – Pedro Pascal in his breakthrough role – and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are now estranged, creating a new dynamic. That's just one change. There will be a new variant of the infected creatures, smarter and more lethal than the old breed. Kaitlyn Dever (Apple Cider Vinegar) joins the cast as soldier Abby, already causing much online chatter because Dever is physically slighter than the character in the video game the series is based on. And Catherine O'Hara takes on a dramatic role as Joel's therapist, because who wouldn't need one after everything he's been through? Pascal, who gives Joel such fierce energy, told Empire magazine that the new season \"further tests our strength against a world we're already afraid to be in\".\n\nThe Last of Us premieres 13 April on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK\n\nApple TV+ (Credit: Apple TV+)\n\n9. Government Cheese\n\nDavid Oyelowo, last seen on television as a 19th-Century US Marshal in Lawman: Bass Reeves, heads to the 20th Century in this surreal comedy and redemption story set in 1969 California. He plays Hampton Chambers, recently released from prison where he was serving time for burglary. He is determined to regain the confidence of his wife and two grown sons, and change the family fortunes by inventing a self-sharpening drill called Bit Magician. Those fortunes are floundering if the title is a clue. Government cheese refers to the bricks of processed cheese the US government once distributed to people who qualified for food assistance. Oyelowo was drawn to the show's most surreal aspect, Hampton's spiritual quest, telling Variety his character has \"this weird interaction with God, where he has a very direct relationship to the point whereby miracles, the likes of which we see in the Bible, are manifesting in his life\".\n\nGovernment Cheese premieres 16 April on Apple TV+ internationally\n\nLucasfilm Ltd (Credit: Lucasfilm Ltd)\n\n10. Andor\n\nThe much-anticipated second season of this prequel to the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) concludes the backstory of Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and his journey from scrappy thief to fighter in the Rebel Alliance, and the heroic figure he is in the film. The many movie spin-off series on Disney+ have been up and down, but there is wide agreement that Andor is one of the best. In a representative view, Vulture's headline for its first season review said, \"Andor is the Cure for Star Wars Ennui\", and went on to call it \"the most challenging and invigorating work in this galaxy in years\". Tony Gilroy, the series' creator, returns for the final go-round, along with a cast that includes Stellan Skarsgård, Ben Mendelsohn, Forest Whitaker and plenty of Stormtroopers. Disney+ has given the new season a big, confident push by making the first available on Hulu and YouTube.\n\nAndor premieres 22 April in the US and 23 April in the UK on Disney+\n\nPhilippe Antonello/ Amazon Prime Video\n\n11. Étoile\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino has created two wildly popular shows, Gilmore Girls and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. But her latest echoes her lesser-known, wonderful Bunheads (2012), with Sutton Foster as a Las Vegas showgirl turned small-town ballet teacher. That show only lasted a season, but has since been embraced by a cult of fans. Étoile is a comic drama with a bigger dance-world canvas, as ballet companies in New York and Paris decide to trade their star dancers in an effort to shore up their flagging institutions. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the head of the Paris company and Luke Kirby (Lenny Bruce in Mrs. Maisel) the head of the New York troupe. The cast also includes Simon Callow and Lou de Laâge, along with dancers from the New York City Ballet and Boston Ballet. As always, a Sherman-Palladino show promises both comic mayhem and sharp dialogue.\n\nÉtoile premieres 24 April on Amazon Prime internationally\n\n--",

        "content": "Climate change: Four things you can do about your carbon footprint\n\n13 November 2024 Share Save Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nTackling climate change will require world leaders to take action on a global level. But as individuals we also contribute to planet-warming emissions. Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact.\n\n1. Changes to your home\n\nFrom installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there are lots of changes you can make around the home that can help the planet. \"Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference,\" according to Dr Neil Jennings of Imperial College London. \"On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change.\" The UK government currently offers grants of £7,500 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs until 2028.\n\nImproving insulation in our walls, ceilings and windows can reduce the loss of heat from our homes. This means less energy is needed to heat them to the same temperature - reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money. Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of insulation, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows and doors.\n\n2. Cut out food waste and cut down on red meat\n\nOverall, the global food system contributes between a quarter and a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. These figures include the meat and dairy industries, but also other food sources like crops. But not all food sources are equally bad for the environment. Red meat, such as beef and lamb, has a particularly high carbon footprint. So cutting consumption of red meat can help to reduce your climate impact. But even the same food source can have a range of impacts, depending on how it is produced and where it comes from. As you can see from the chart below, for example, even chicken with a high climate impact tends to fare better than low impact beef.\n\nAs a result, it is not just a question of \"tagging individual products as good or bad\", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen.\n\nDr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home. Around 25-30% of the food produced around the world is lost or wasted, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme. And global food loss and waste contributes around 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a UN report.\n\n3. Drive less, fly less\n\nTransport is responsible for roughly a quarter of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Living car-free might be \"the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions,\" according to Dr Jennings. However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled. Small actions can still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours. Switching to an electric car can also greatly reduce your carbon footprint. Unlike petrol and diesel cars, fully electric cars do not produce carbon dioxide as they are driving along, although there are emissions from manufacturing the vehicle and generating electricity that powers it. Over their lifetime, fully electric cars cut emissions by around two-thirds in Europe and the United States compared with petrol equivalents. And as electricity gets cleaner, with wind and solar displacing fossil fuel power, electric cars will have an even bigger emissions advantage over petrol and diesel. The cost of electric cars has been expensive historically, but prices have generally been coming down. As a result, the number of electric cars is growing quickly in some parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.\n\nUnfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals. Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre. Taking these journeys by train can reduce your climate impact. \"For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint,\" says Dr Jennings.\n\n4. Think before you buy\n\nA single pair of some types of jeans can produce more than 30kg of carbon dioxide equivalent across their lifespan, taking into account cotton production, manufacture, transport and washing. However, the carbon footprint of different types of clothing varies substantially from case to case - so what, and how much, you buy can make a difference.\n\nGetty Images Buying second-hand can reduce waste and save you money too",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Upside down\n\n3 days ago Share Save Riley Farrell Share Save\n\nMicky Wiswedel WWF The rhino horn acts as a tail feather, reducing the risk of spinning (Credit: Micky Wiswedel WWF)\n\nMoving endangered rhinos to new areas is a vital part of their conservation. War-torn helicopters from the Vietnam war are airlifting the creatures to safety.\n\nZipping through the skies over South Africa, a 1,300kg (2,865lbs) horned herbivore is dangling by its feet from a helicopter. It may be a shocking sight to behold but, within the last decade, the use of helicopters in rhinoceros conservation has been gaining momentum in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.\n\nBlack rhinos are moved around for three reasons, says Ursina Rusch, population manager for the WWF South Africa Black Rhino Range Expansion Project. First, to protect them from poaching. Secondly, for monitoring purposes – rhino researchers often take the opportunity to insert satellite GPS telemetry into the rhinos' horns. And, thirdly, to ensure their genetic population is as diverse as possible. The species mostly exists within protected pockets on public and private reserves, so translocation is one of the only available methods to increase their range.\n\nNamibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism Transporting rhinos by helicopter is faster and less stressful for the animal than other methods (Credit: Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism)\n\n\"If we don't translocate rhinos and create new populations, they will inbreed enough that they crash, or run out of resources and stop breeding,\" says Rusch. Black rhino population growth rates are density dependent. This means if a rhino community is too crowded, the females will start having longer intercalving periods – the time between the birth of one calf and the next – and so produce fewer calves, an evolutionary response and adaptation to resource management.\n\nWhile the transport of animals for population regrowth and genetic diversity isn't new, the regular use of helicopters in this fight is. Beginning in the 1990s but refining methods since the 2010s, helicopters have \"revolutionised the world of rhino conservation\", says Rusch. Her WWF project has translocated around 270 rhinos, of which about 160 have been airlifted.\n\nLeaning from an airborne helicopter, a veterinarian \"darts the rhino in the bum\" with immobilising drugs, typically targeting youngsters or dominant bulls that need to be removed to prevent inbreeding, says Rusch. Rhino immobilisation typically involves a potent opioid and a tranquilliser.\n\nThe anatomy of the rhino means it is, remarkably, able to breathe comfortably upside down\n\nWhereas before veterinarians would have spent 20 minutes on-foot tracking a half-way-sedated rhino, the helicopter team now saves precious time by aerially tracking the rhino – and within four minutes, the rhino falls unconscious, says Rusch. By the time the rhino goes down, the ground team and the helicopter team spring into action: quickly approaching the rhino for processing. They take biological samples and measurements and insert microchips for monitoring.\n\nNext, the crew ties big, soft straps around the rhino's four ankles. The straps connect to a single rope which is hooked to the underside of the helicopter.\n\nWatch how upside-down airlifts save rhinos in Africa\n\nThen the move happens. The helicopter airlifts the rhino, which dangles below, to a central location – generally an open field – where ground crews are waiting, says Rusch.\n\nHistorically, the rhino would have been woken up from the immobilising drug and walked into a crate, before being hoisted onto the back of a truck headed for a conservancy. But these road trips could be stressful for the rhino passengers; they're awake for the journey (albeit, sometimes, anaesthetised) and standing in a crate, which can cause muscle or horn damage – or even occlude their airways, which can be fatal. Moreover, the limited road network in the region and difficult terrain made it hard to reach the remote final locations using ground transport.\n\nThis is where airlifting comes in. The health risks of crate travel and lack of roads – for instance, in Namibia's Kunene region – mean that nowadays, helicopters are increasingly used for the translocation of rhinos, explains Robin Radcliffe, associate professor of wildlife and conservation medicine at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. Conservationists \"really only consider slinging\" as a solution when the capture or release site is inaccessible by road, he says, or when slinging significantly cuts down on transport time.\n\nNamibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism Some of the helicopters still bear the scars of war (Credit: Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism)\n\nIn Rusch's experience, researchers and conservationists employ two main helicopters to transport black rhinos: the Airbus AS350 Astar and the UH1-H Huey.\n\nThe Airbus AS350 Astar, nicknamed the \"Squirrel,\" has been used since 2021, says Rusch. This helicopter is small, cost-effective and readily available in South Africa, she adds.\n\nUH1-H Hueys, on the other hand, are designed for lifting large loads. Famously used during the Vietnam War, some of these \"iconic helicopters\" still exhibit bullet hole patches and floor installations for mounted gun covers, says Rusch. Nowadays, these military-grade helicopters – complete with windows under the cockpit so the pilot can see the ground below – are valuable for civilians in firefighting and rhino conservation.\n\n\"The Hueys' blades have a unique flap – they really slap the air,\" Rusch says. \"That was the sound soldiers in the Vietnam war wanted to hear, feeling that relief of someone rescuing them.\" The Huey – made famous by Hollywood films including Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket – has become synonymous with the Vietnam War and provided close heliborne support to US soldiers, evacuating the wounded and the dead.\n\nCarbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nThe fateful twist of using a machine of war to save lives is not lost on the conservationists who fly in the helicopters. \"Ironically, in the 80s, helicopters were used by some poachers to kill rhinos,\" says Radcliffe. \"The fact that helicopters are now being used to save them is a wonderful example of conservation.\" Translocation is one of the most valuable tools of rhino conservation, he adds.\n\nWWF's Black Rhino Range Expansion Project has 18 project sites, with over 400 black rhinos spread across the site, making up 15% of all black rhinos in South Africa, says Rusch. \"Really none of this would be possible without helicopters, both in terms of darting and transferring rhinos out of inaccessible areas,\" she says.\n\nRadcliffe's team, which partnered with Namibia's government, pioneered the netless, slinging method of moving rhinos upside down under a helicopter. In 2021, Radcliffe and his colleagues won an Ig Nobel Prize – an award satirising the Nobel Prize given to \"research that makes people laugh and then think\" – for their work on hanging black rhino upside down.\n\nBRREP WWF Researchers tried a few different methods of airlifting rhinos safely, including by cradling them in nets (Credit: BRREP WWF)\n\nAs the opioid used reduces the rhinos' blood oxygen levels, it's all the more crucial to determine which flight position is best for breathing. Before settling on the upside-down position, Radcliffe and his fellow researchers tried laying the flying rhinos on boards tethered to the helicopter, which wasn't aerodynamic as the board caused excess swaying in mid-air, says Radcliffe.\n\nThen, his team tested rhinos in nets, which \"aerodynamically worked a bit better, but still wasn't ideal\". The net's positioning compromised the rhino's breathing. Plus, the net's metal frame added considerable weight and required even more ground personnel to place the rhinos into the net, \"which defeated the purpose of having a quick and efficient transport method\", explained Radcliffe.\n\nAirborne inversion is the safest option, says Radcliffe. The anatomy of the rhino means it is, remarkably, able to breathe comfortably upside down, Radcliffe says. Hanging by their legs, the weight and build of rhinos allow them to extend their head and neck downwards, straightening the spine. Also, a \"safer, smoother flight\" occurs because the rhino horn acts as a \"tail feather or wind vane,\" reducing the risk of spinning. \"The great thing about lifting the rhinos upside down by their feet is that they're aerodynamic themselves,\" says Radcliffe.\n\nWhile the image of an upside-down rhino may initially seem \"cruel\", the rhino's well-being is always \"paramount\" before, during and after the 10-30 minutes of airborne time, says Rusch. \"The rhino is constantly under supervision of experienced veterinarians and pilots, who can tell if the rhino is comfortable or straining,\" she says.\n\nNamibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism Moving rhinos by helicopter has allowed conservationists to take them to places that would have been unreachable (Credit: Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism)\n\nNonetheless, conservation is not without some cost. Helicopter-use creates air and noise pollution. \"In a perfect world we'd have a zero-carbon footprint,\" says Radcliffe. \"But we, as humans, are obligated to make a concerted effort to save species like the rhinoceros. They are in serious decline, not because of normal ecological processes, but because of our own actions.\"\n\nRhinos have existed for 50 million years and fossil evidence indicates that there were once upwards of 150 rhino species. Now there are five.\n\n\"I don't want to tell my grandchildren that we did have rhinos when I was growing up, but they're no longer here because humans poached them and destroyed their habitat,\" says Radcliffe.\n\nSlowly but surely, helicopters are making a difference. Thirty years ago, the black rhino population in Kunene, in the north-west of Namibia, was depleted, explains Radcliffe. However, in 2010, Namibia's first rhino airlift has allowed these animals to return to the region. Due to the impassable, vast mountain ranges in the region, the airlift allowed the introduction of rhinos into areas that otherwise would have been beyond reach. Scientists, like Radcliffe, are committed to continually studying and honing these heli-moves, and they plan to incorporate emerging technologies such as drones and satellites into rhino conservation too.\n\nRadcliffe envisions that in the future, this innovative method of rhino conservation could even be applied to the rainforest environments of Indonesia, where Sumatran rhinos are critically endangered. And beyond rhino, the technique of lifting large ungulates – or large mammals with hooves – upside down has also been applied to other species such as elephants and some endangered antelope, Radcliffe adds.\n\nIn the meantime, according to Rusch, South Africa's translocated rhinos seem to be thriving – grazing and breeding in their new homes.\n\n\"You get to know the rhinos, their individualities, their personalities,\" says Rusch. \"They get released on the other side, and then you get to watch these populations grow – from first to second to third-generation offspring.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "The world keeps running out of helium. There is now a race to prepare for the next shortage\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Callum Bains Share Save\n\nNasa/ Sophia Roberts\n\nOur lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\n\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\n\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\n\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer – a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\n\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton. \"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\n\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\n\nYou might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium\n\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running – the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\n\nWhat is helium used for? Helium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density. The space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets. Helium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners. Helium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density. Deep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\n\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\n\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\n\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\n\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\n\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\n\nAlamy Liquid helium is used to cool the superconducting magnets at facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nThat demand is only expected to rise further – with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\n\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\n\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\n\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile – resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\n\nNasa/ Jim Grossmann Despite its myriad uses – including by the space sector – helium is difficult to store and transport (Credit: Nasa/ Jim Grossmann)\n\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve – the US Federal Helium Reserve – has triggered further uncertainty.\n\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association – AdvaMed – urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\n\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\n\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit – this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\n\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\n\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\n\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is\n\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\n\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\n\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\n\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\n\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla – roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\n\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\n\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (£238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\n\nGetty Images Magnetic Resonance Imaging has become a vital tool in hospitals around the world, but these scanners rely upon large amounts of helium to keep running (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBut installing helium recovery technology – complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments – is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (£476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\n\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\n\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\n\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\n\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is – and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\n\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

When he died in 2012, the American painter had been rocked by business problems, but at his commercial peak a decade earlier, his company was bringing in more than $100m a year. And yet his work was despised by many critics – not because it was blasphemous or obscene, but because, well, he specialised in quaint pictures of thatched-roof rural cottages nestling in leafy groves. \"Thomas Kinkade's style is illustrative saccharine fantasy rather than art with which you can connect at any meaningful level,\" Charlotte Mullins, the author of A Little History of Art, tells the BBC. \"It is schmaltzy pastiches of Disney-style woodland scenes, complete with cutesy animals and fairy tale cottages. They are… like the images you find on cheap greetings cards – sugary and forgettable.\" And compared to some critics, Mullins is being polite.\n\nHis branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all – Miranda Yousef\n\nThese critics don't just consider Kinkade's paintings to be nauseatingly sickly, they detect something disturbing and ominous about them. In her 2003 book on California, Where I Was From, Joan Didion summed up his art by saying. \"It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent cosiness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.\" As harsh as that sounds, Didion may have been more perceptive than she realised. Art for Everybody, a new documentary directed by Miranda Yousef, shows that the man who called himself the \"Painter of Light\" did indeed have a dark side. \"His branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all,\" Yousef tells the BBC. \"He lived a Greek tragedy of a life.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade specialised in quaint pictures of rural cottages, which were loved by many, but despised by critics (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nThe documentary features audio tapes recorded by Kinkade when he was a long-haired, bohemian-looking art student in California in the 1970s – and even then, he was already fretting over the question of whether he could make an impact as an artist while making a decent living. After a stint in Hollywood, painting backgrounds for Ralph Bakshi's 1983 animated feature film, Fire and Ice, he concentrated on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, and he and his wife Nanette sold reproductions of them outside a local grocer's shop. In the 1990s, he took the idealism and the nostalgia to new heights, and swapped his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes that a Hobbit might deem a bit on the twee side. Old-fashioned lampposts and cottage windows glowed. Streams twinkled beneath slender stone footbridges. Bushes burst with pastel flowers. And cash registers rang. Kinkade didn't sell the paintings themselves, but the hazy idylls they depicted were soon being printed on collectible plates advertised in newspapers and magazines. For many Americans, they were comforting refuges from the modern world.\n\nToday we would think they had been produced by AI, designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula – Charlotte Mullins\n\nIn Art for Everybody, Christopher Knight, the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, is contemptuous of Kinkade's imagery. \"It's a cliché piled upon a fantasy piled upon a bad idea,\" he says. \"The colour is juiced and the light coming from inside those cottages is intense and blaring.\" Just as importantly, as far as his critics were concerned, Kinkade's pictures had nothing to them beyond their superficial decorative qualities. \"They are banal and hollow, with no intent to say anything meaningful,\" says Mullins. \"Today we would think they had been produced by AI – designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula.\" But Yousef insists that Kinkade's skill can't be discounted. \"There were actually other people who were painting cottages and Christmas scenes and putting them on plates and all that stuff,\" she notes, \"and the thing is that Kinkade's were so much better. His works just blew everybody else's out of the water.\"\n\nShe also believes that Kinkade's paintings, rather than being wholly market-led, were linked to his childhood in Placerville, California, where he was raised by his single mother and only intermittently saw his violent father. \"It's a common criticism that his cottages look like they're on fire on the inside. And then you learn that it was because when he was growing up it was always cold and dark in the house when he got home, because they didn't have the money to keep the heat and the lights on. He was painting the thing that he wanted.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade focused on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, before swapping his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nKinkade's deprived upbringing, says Yousef, didn't just inspire his choice of subject matter, but drove him to make as much money as he could. He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, \"He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone.\"\n\nBehind the fantasy\n\nWhatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being \"obfuscatory and disingenuous\" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. \"Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,\" she says. \"They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade printed pictures and merchandise on an industrial scale and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nStill, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. \"This is not legitimate art,\" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet \"Painter of Light\", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. \"The art world is a world of darkness today,\" he thundered. He, in contrast, was \"someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty\". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona.\n\nBut that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called \"cut\". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. \"Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,\" says Yousef, \"and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.\"\n\nIn order to maintain this brand and the vast business empire that went with it, Kinkade had to present himself as a Christian paragon, and he had to complete a stylistically identical painting every month. That meant that he had to suppress other, more conflicted parts of his psyche. The strain became too much. In the mid-2000s, Kinkade fell out with his business partners, and had legal battles with gallery franchisees. He reinvented himself as a womanising, hard-drinking hellraiser. After some interventions by his friends and family, some time in rehab, and the collapse of his marriage, he died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and diazepam at the age of 54.\n\nArt for Everybody The documentary Art for Everybody explores the dark, troubled person behind the wholesome persona Kinkade had created (Credit: Art for Everybody)\n\nIt was only after his death that his family sorted through the vault containing his artwork, and uncovered a stash of bleak, violent drawings and paintings that seemed to express his inner rage and fear in a way that his cottage paintings never could: a shack in the middle of nowhere on a murky night; a nun pointing a gun at herself; giant monsters and distorted faces. Art for Everybody raises the questions of whether these pictures are more authentic than the ones the public knew about. Do they express how Kinkade really felt about his difficult upbringing and his frightening father? Would it have been healthier for him to explore the shadowy netherworlds in these pictures instead of shutting himself inside his stifling sylvan cottages, year after year? And were his critics right to say that his famous paintings were disturbing all along? \"One of the things that was obvious early on,\" says Yousef, \"was that his fans had a two-dimensional view of him and his critics had another completely different two-dimensional view of him. I knew there was a three-dimensional person in there somewhere, and that's what I wanted to try to find.\"\n\nIn some ways, Kinkade was ahead of his time. First, he was a culture warrior before culture wars were being fought as fiercely as they are now. As someone who claimed that he was taking a stand for Christianity and patriotism and against the intellectual elite, he was staking out territory occupied by more and more in the US today. He was also ahead of his time as an artist with such a brazen commercial side. \"Today we're seeing all these artist collabs,\" says Yousef. \"There's Yayoi Kusama who's working with Louis Vuitton, and Tom Sachs is working with Nike, and Kehinde Wiley is doing a collab with American Express, whereas you see in the movie an MBNA bank card with a Thomas Kinkade painting on it. He was already doing it 20 or 30 years ago.\"\n\nFinally, by calling himself the Painter of Light, and by trading on his pious family-man persona, Kinkade turned himself into a kind of product. \"Look at where we are today with social media, and everybody being a brand,\" says Yousef. \"He was really ahead of his time with that. But I think that one of the big questions of the film is, what are the costs of turning yourself into a brand?\" In Kinkade's case, the costs were unbearably high.\n\nArt for Everybody is released on 28 March in the US.\n\n--",

        "content": "The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n\n3 days ago Share Save Vittoria Traverso Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIt's mentioned 17 times in the Bible and was harvested in the Mediterranean for more than a millennium. Now, a farmer is reviving this ancient \"superfood\".\n\nIt's a hot and muggy summer day in Sicily's Madonie mountains, a rugged range of ridges about 65km east of Palermo. In a field of ash trees, the buzzing of cicadas is interrupted by a voice. \"You came at the right time,\" says Giulio Gelardi, a local farmer pointing towards a white-streaked branch. \"This is the famous manna.\"\n\nAlong the bark of each tree are thick lines of manna, a white mineral-rich resin referenced in the Bible 17 times that has been used as a natural sweetener and medicinal aid for centuries. Manna harvesting (the practice of cutting the bark of Fraxinus ornus trees to collect their sap), used to be a common practice throughout the Mediterranean. But in the past 80 years, urbanisation and industrialisation have led to it nearly vanishing.\n\nFor the past 30 years, Gelardi has made it his mission to put this Biblical superfood back on our tables, and today, this once-forgotten sap is being used by chefs and pastry makers in innovative ways.\n\nVittoria Traverso Manna is a white mineral-rich resin that has been harvested for more than a millennium (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nEven if you've never tasted manna, you may have heard of it. The phrase \"manna from heaven\" refers to a Biblical story where a food falls from the sky to nourish the Israelites as they crossed the Sinai desert. In Exodus, manna is described as a \"flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed on the ground\". While experts disagree what substance, specifically, this passage refers to, a honey-like, flaky and frost-coloured resin named manna has been extracted from the bark of ash trees in the Mediterranean region for more than a millennium.\n\nIn the Madonie mountains – home to the 40,000-hectare Madonie Natural Park – manna harvesting dates back to at least the 9th Century when the island was under Arab rule. During the Renaissance, Sicilian farmers used to collect this sweet sap – which tastes like cane sugar with almond undertones – and sell it to merchants from around the Mediterranean, a highly profitable trade that led the Kingdom of Naples to put taxes on it during the 16th Century.\n\nUntil World War Two, manna farming was a way of life for many Sicilian families. Footage from 1936 shows local farmers harvesting the substance, which was commonly sold to pharmaceutical companies to extract mannitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and a diuretic. In the 1950s, scientists found a way to synthesise mannitol, and in the decades that followed, manna harvesting virtually disappeared.\n\nWhen Gelardi came back to his hometown of Pollina in 1985 after 15 years away, he realised that one of the core components of his local culture was vanishing. \"When I was growing up, everyone knew how to extract manna,\" he explains. \"When I came back, there were less than 100 farmers who could still do it.\"\n\nAlamy Pollina is a medieval hilltop town surrounded by the Madonie mountains (Credit: Alamy)\n\nPollina is a 3,000-person medieval town that seems sculpted out of the surrounding limestone hills. As a child, Gelardi learned to harvest manna in the summer from his parents. \"Manna harvesting involved the whole family,\" he explains. Men used handmade billhooks to make thin cuts along the bark, women collected the overflowing sap using dried prickly pear stems and children turned the goopy nectar into cylindrical cones called cannoli, due to their resemblance to the popular Sicilian sweet.\n\nAccording to Gelardi, the hardest part of manna harvesting is knowing when to cut the bark. Ash trees produce sap year-round but only produce enough resin to harvest during the hottest days of the year. Gelardi says if you cut the bark too early, it can cause the trees to stop making manna altogether. \"Finding out when the moment for cutting has come is a unique skill based on observation and intuition,\" he says, explaining: \"[It's necessary to] listen to each plant.\"\n\nFor example, leaves turning from dark green to lighter green with yellow marks may mean that a tree has reached peak manna production. Spotting cracks in the ground near the roots can also mean it's ready for harvest, as plants produce surplus sap to overcome dry spells. When the tree looks ready, manna farmers make a shallow cut in the bark and observe the plant's reaction. If a plant is mature enough, a small amount of resin will ooze from the cut. Farmers can then proceed to make deeper carvings, as small streams of sticky manna will flow towards the roots.\n\n\"Manna harvesting is not something you can learn from a book,\" Gelardi explains. \"If we don't pass these skills down to the next generation, we would lose centuries-old local farming knowledge.\"\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi has made it his mission to revive the ancient practice of manna harvesting in his hometown of Pollina (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nA few months after returning to Pollina, Gelardi set out to revive the waning tradition. At first, most locals did not meet his \"manna renaissance\" with enthusiasm. \"My friends thought I was crazy. They said manna was a thing of the past,\" he says. Undeterred, Gelardi spent months learning all he could about it.\n\nHe spent time with elder farmers to refine his harvesting skills and visited Palermo's public library to study manna. \"I knew manna was used locally as a sweetener, a moisturiser and a diuretic,\" he says. \"But I learned that it could also be used to treat food intoxication, a variety of skin conditions, arthritis and cold symptoms.\"\n\nGelardi also started to realise how manna shaped local geography and culture. For example, Gibilmanna, a nearby hill home to a famous sanctuary, owes its name to the Arab words \"gibil\" (mountain) and \"manna\". Local expressions are also shaped by manna, like the local phrase, \"vivere di mieli e manna\" (\"to live of honey and manna\"), meaning living an affluent life.\n\nIn 1986 Gelardi began handing out pamphlets containing facts about manna to tourists staying at a nearby resort. \"People were captivated by manna's healing properties and its impact on local culture,\" he recalls. By the 1990s, he was leading tours demonstrating how to harvest manna to international travellers. \"They started to see it as our local superfood,\" he says.\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi developed a new and more efficient way to harvest manna (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nManna is mostly composed of mannitol, a naturally sweet crystal compound, as well as minerals like potassium, magnesium and calcium. According to Vivienne Spadaro, a professor of botany at the University of Palermo, this thick white resin can be used as a dietary supplement to reintegrate minerals, especially potassium, and as a base for several medicines. \"Manna has been used to treat constipation, cough, sore-throats and skin wounds due to its decongestant and soothing properties,\" she says. And because of its low glycemic index, Spadaro says some manna can be used as a sweetener for diabetic people or those on hypo-caloric diets.\n\nWhere to find manna In addition to Hostaria Cycas and Nangalarruni, look for manna at La Manna di Zabbra. This family-owned B&B and restaurant in Pollina offers a salad of local edible flowers sprinkled with manna flakes as well as jams. If you visit between July and August, you can witness the century-old process of manna harvesting in the family’s ash tree field.\n\nWhile leading manna tours, Gelardi developed a more efficient way to harvest the substance with far less risk of contamination from bark or insects. He created a \"clean manna\" technique by attaching a small aluminum spout to the tree so that manna flows away from the trunk along a fishing line attached to the spout. This allowed Gelardi to nearly double his manna production.\n\nIn the following years, Gelardi started selling his manna to bakers and pastry chefs, who incorporated it into everything from cannoli, wafers, flakes and chocolates. He also sold manna to pharmacies to make laxatives, minerals supplements and skin products. In recent years French skincare companies Biotherm and Yves Roche have used it to make skin moisturisers.\n\nIn 2002, manna from the Madonie was declared a protected ingredient by Slow Food, an international organisation that promotes endangered food traditions. By the mid-2000s, manna became a sought-after ingredient for local chefs and pastry-makers.\n\nAlamy Today, manna is used by a variety of local and international chefs, including in nearby Castelbuono, Sicily (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I started using manna to make pandolce (fruitcake) with manna and almonds, but then realised it goes well with savoury dishes, too,\" says Giuseppe Zingales, chef at Hostaria Cycas in the nearby medieval village of Castelbuono. The restaurant offers many manna-infused dishes, including manna-crusted pork tenderloin; risotto with asparagus, bacon and manna; and wild thistle flan with manna fondue. At another Castelbuono eatery, Ristorante Nangalarruni, chefs Peppe Carollo and his daughter Francesca use crushed manna to create one of the restaurant's signature dishes: suckling pig with almonds, pistachio and manna crust.\n\n\"The key is to [use] it well,\" Francesca Carollo explains, \"A small portion of sweet-tasting manna offers a nice contrast to roast meat flavour, but too much manna can make this dish too sweet.\"\n\nPastry chefs are particularly interested in manna. Nicola Fiasconaro, one of Italy's most famous patissiers, now produces a special edition of panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas fruitcake, made with chocolate and frosted manna, while Michelin-starred chef Davide Oldani featured chocolate-covered manna sticks as part of the menu of his Milan-area restaurant D'O from 2014 to 2016. In recent years, the Madonie's \"white gold\", as it is sometimes called, has reached a price of €200 per kg and has been used to make a variety of sugar-free baked goods, from muffins to biscotti.\n\nMost chefs buy manna from the Madonie's Manna Consortium, a cooperative created in 2015 by Gelardi and other farmers to market manna products and promote manna harvesting to younger farmers.\n\nAlamy Nicola Fiasconaro's pastry shop in Castelbuono sells manna flakes (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I grew up hearing about manna but had never learned how to harvest it,\" says Mario Cicero, who belongs to the Consortium. Born in Castelbuono, he spent years working around the world as a chef before returning to the Madonie. As part of his training, Cicero spent months with older farmers, including Gelardi. \"Giulio's taught me many tricks,\" he says, \"but he mostly passed on a contagious passion for manna harvesting.\" Cicero now tends 200 ash trees in his farm near Castelbuono and hopes that more young people will take up manna harvesting.\n\nSeeing young farmers like Cicero becoming ntaccaluori (Sicilian for \"cutters\") is what Gelardi is most proud about. As he explains: \"Every young person that learns how to harvest manna will ensure the survival of a centuries-old tradition.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

It means the world to me to have the three lions on my chest once again,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"Leading England as captain was my life for 10 years and I will forever be passionate about this team and our legacy. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.\"\n\nEngland are yet to name a new captain. Vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously stated she would be interested in the role, while off-spinner Charlie Dean said she \"wouldn't say no\".\n\nThe upheaval at the top of the England team comes as a result of a review into the Ashes, led by director of women's cricket Clare Connor.\n\nRealistically, Edwards was the standout candidate to lead a rebuild, with Connor describing her as a \"proven winner\". Following her stellar playing career, she has enjoyed considerable success as a coach.\n\nHer Southern Vipers have been the strongest team in English domestic cricket and Edwards' Southern Brave won the women's Hundred in 2023.\n\nOverseas, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in three seasons at the Women's Premier League in India. In 2022, Edwards' Sydney Sixers were beaten in the final of Australia's Big Bash.\n\n\"When we drew up the criteria for the job it became apparent very quickly that Charlotte was the outstanding candidate,\" Connor added.\n\n\"She has the experience, passion and expertise to lead this team to success. The results she has achieved as a head coach in multiple environments, since retiring as one of the greatest ever England players, is testament to her relentless drive and the standards she sets for those around her.\n\n\"She is a proven winner; she has won repeatedly as a player and now as a coach. She possesses a deep knowledge of the game, both in England and across the world, and she understands the importance of creating an environment that is both challenging and supportive.\"\n\nEdwards will lead England in home white-ball series against West Indies and India this summer, building up to the 50-over World Cup in India in October.",

The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Much of the work needed to curb climate change goes beyond the remit of individuals – from scaling up renewable energy to stopping the production of oil, gas and coal. But research shows that individual actions can add up too.\n\nBut it can sometimes feel overwhelming to know where to start. Which steps can actually make a meaningful difference? We have rounded up some of the most impactful actions you can take to live a more sustainable life this year, from eating more plant-based food to reducing your number of flights to buying more second-hand clothes.\n\nEat a plant-based diet\n\nBy 2033, it's thought that there will be almost two billion cattle, one billion pigs, 32 billion poultry, and nearly three billion sheep on our small blue-green planet – that's some 38 billion individual animals. As they go about their lives, all will be releasing the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide – molecules which have effects 28 and 265 times stronger at warming the planet than carbon dioxide, respectively. That's not to mention the vast amounts of land and water required to keep them.\n\nAs a result, it's widely agreed among the scientific community that to rescue the global climate from ever-warming temperatures, one of the most impactful ways our species can change its behaviour is to eat less meat. According to one UK study, vegans have diets that emit just 25% of the carbon emissions of the most carnivorous meat-eaters, while both vegetarians and vegans have significantly lower water use and cause less harm to biodiversity than omnivorous ones.\n\nGetty Images Vegans have diets that emit just 25% of the carbon emissions of the most carnivorous meat-eaters (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2022, BBC Earth features editor Martha Henriques and senior journalist Zaria Gorvett decided to put this to the test, and tracked the carbon emissions of their meals over the course of a week. They found that the vegan diet did indeed have lower emissions overall, though on some days of the week the vegetarian diet won. Surprisingly, the amount of food waste generated and the cooking methods used each day also had a sizeable impact.\n\nRead more from the BBC about the climate benefits of veganism and vegetarianism.\n\nTake the train instead of flying\n\nTransport is the biggest source of emissions in the US, where it contributes almost a third of the total emissions, and makes up 16% of emissions globally. While infrastructure change is critical to helping people cut the emissions from transport, individual action can still can go a long way toward reducing this.\n\nIf you fly regularly, it's probably making up a huge proportion of your carbon footprint, so cutting out any flight is one of the best ways to live more sustainably. Using the train, bus or even a car with more than one person is nearly always lower carbon per km or mile. And reducing flying will also likely mean you travel closer to home, reducing carbon even further.\n\nWhat if we all stopped flying tomorrow?\n\nThis year one of our writers, Matilda Welin, even tried replacing an airplane journey between London and Sweden with a long-distance bike ride. While it cost more and took far longer than the plane would have, she experienced an \"unforgettable journey\" and enjoyed seeing the world \"at human speed\". She now feels prepared to do shorter long-distance bikes rides more often, replacing car and train rides.\n\nBuy fewer clothes\n\nSo how can you make your wardrobe more sustainable? The best thing you can do is to buy fewer new garments, especially fast fashion items which are often made from unsustainable materials.\n\nInstead, you could rent clothes, upcycle your existing wardrobe or switch to second-hand clothes in thrift stores or through online platforms such as Vinted, Depop or eBay. Currently second-hand or upcycled clothing makes up just 9% of the average wardrobe in the US, but it is growing faster than any other channel in the US fashion sector and is expected to be a nearly $90bn (£73bn) market in the next 10 years. Read more about how to make your wardrobe more climate-friendly.\n\nWashing your clothes less frequently can also help reduce your wardrobe's carbon footprint, by lowering energy usage, as well as prevent harmful microplastics from entering waterways.\n\nGetty Images Instead of buying fast fashion items, you could rent clothes or switch to second-hand clothes from thrift stores (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nReduce your carbon paw print\n\nWe love our pets. But research shows keeping animals is not always the most environmentally friendly thing to do. Take pet cats. They can generate over three tonnes of CO2 over the course of their life – equivalent to driving a petrol car 12,070km (7,500 miles).\n\nLuckily, there are ways to reduce our animals' carbon paw print. One option is to switch to more sustainable protein for their feed. The production of fish, for example, results in just a quarter of the emissions associated with lamb and beef. Another alternative protein gaining popularity in pet food is insects – which can be fed on food waste, and have a high feed-to-meat conversion rate.\n\nA simple – but perhaps surprising – way to make your beloved pooch more sustainable is to switch to recycled dog poo bags, as opposed to bags made from virgin plastic or compostable alternatives, which have a surprising climate impact. Read more about how to make your pets more environmentally friendly.\n\nConsider heating alternatives\n\nKeeping our buildings warm through winter is one of the biggest challenges in sustainable energy. Fossil fuels still meet 60% of the world's energy demand for heating, and emissions from the sector are still growing despite a rise in renewable heat.\n\nIf we're going to switch off our gas boilers – or at least turn the thermostat down for now, what can replace this source of heat to keep homes safely warm?\n\nTapping that tantalising waste heat is often a district or city-wide project. But lower-carbon options are also emerging for individuals.\n\nGetty Images By 2030, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 500 million tonnes (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHeat pumps are now one of the most carbon-efficient ways to heat homes, alongside thermal energy from solar. Installation costs for heat pumps have seen a modest decline internationally, with costs predicted to decline a little further to 2030, according to one analysis. They are still however an expensive upfront cost, though there are financial incentives for heat pumps in 30 countries.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that by 2030, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 500 million tonnes, or the equivalent of the annual CO2 emissions of all cars in Europe today.\n\nIn the meantime, for those reliant on a gas boiler, basic fixes can help improve the efficiency of your heating and reduce energy bills – such as improved insulation, draught excluders and thick curtains.\n\nInvest in a greener pension\n\nWhen discussing sustainability, we don't often think of our personal finances. But how we choose to save, invest and spend our money can make a surprisingly big difference to the climate.\n\nRead more about why your banking habits matter for the climate. Your pension is one of the most direct ways in which you can make your spending greener. Pension funds are the largest investors in global capital markets, with total assets over $56tn (£44.5tn), making your pension an incredibly powerful tool. Despite this, most people don't even know how their pension is invested. A good first step is to ask your pension provider what they are investing in about their sustainability policies and options.\n\nRead more about how to make your pension more sustainable in this story by Jocelyn Timperley.\n\nGetty Images Caption: Research shows that individual actions can add up and help curb global warming (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nCut down on single-use plastic\n\nBuying loose vegetables is a great way to help rid your weekly shop of plastic, but often you still need to bag them in store – and the bags available are often plastic. The solution? Bring your own muslin reusable produce bag.\n\nPerhaps also have a think about where you buy your milk. Milk vending machines are popping up on farms all over the UK and the trend is beginning to catch on in North America too. You bring your own glass bottles (or buy one there), and fill up with fresh milk – eliminating the need for plastic packaging.\n\nYou could also start shopping at a zero-waste store, where you can refill your bathroom and plastic-free cleaning products. Once you've got a tin (either buy one from the store or reuse a biscuit tin), a soap dispenser, and a spray bottle, you just reorder the products as and when you need them, and they're shipped in paper packaging.\n\nSwap cling film for beeswax wrapping. Available in fancy patterns or just plain, they're forever reusable as they can be easily rewaxed with beeswax once it wears off.\n\nPlastic utensils are hard to recycle (at least in the US). So think twice about whether you really need them, or carry around a portable utensil kit, which usually come in neat carry cases. This applies to straws too. Paper straws aren't necessarily better for the environment, so you could include a reusable straw in your kit too.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\n\nAtlanta – the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South – started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\n\nThe SpeciaList Kandi Burruss is an Atlanta born-and-based musician, producer, actor, business owner and reality TV star. She has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran, and her work on the single No Scrubs earned her a Grammy Award in 1999. She is the owner of Bedroom Kandi, a line of sex toys; Kandi Koated cosmetics; and hosts a podcast called The Business of Pleasure. In addition to appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 14 seasons, Burruss recently starred in Showtime's The Chi and Hulu's Reasonable Doubt. In 2021, the Atlanta suburb South Fulton declared 18 December Kandi Burruss Tucker Day.\n\nRanking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent – like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through. \"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\n\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\n\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\n\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\n\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It’s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it’s such a place to be.\"\n\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\n\nSimon Property Group When Burruss wants to shop the hottest looks, she heads straight to Lenox Square (Credit: Simon Property Group)\n\n1. Best shopping: Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza\n\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\n\"People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,\" she says.\n\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.\n\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/ Address: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326 Phone: +14042336767 Instagram: @lenoxsqmall\n\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza Address: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326 Phone: +14042620992 Instagram: @shopphippsplaza\n\nAlamy Toast, with locations in Atlanta's Midtown and Buckhead neighbourhoods, serves a fashionable New American Brunch (Credit: Alamy)\n\n2.

While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\n\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shereé Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.\n\nWebsite: https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/ Address: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324 Phone: +14047484594 Instagram: @toastonlenox\n\nGetty Images Burruss likes to catch up with her girlfriends over modern Southern dishes and great playlist at Frost Bistro & Bar (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n3.

So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta.

On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\n\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\n\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills – a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\n\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance – of around 17km per day – makes the hike unsuitable for total novices. Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\n\nSilvano Mezzenzana Mount Nebo is believed to be where Moses stood to view the Promised Land before his death (Credit: Silvano Mezzenzana)\n\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\n\nThe Best of 2025 Jordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\n\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\n\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived – and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\n\nSilvano Mezzenzana The 50km route has recently been twinned with Spain's Camino de Santiago (Credit: Silvano Mezzenzana)\n\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages – something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\n\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published last year found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\n\nPlan your trip The Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\n\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria – who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan – a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\n\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\n\nAlamy The three-day hike takes in some of Jordan's most sacred Christian sites (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\n\nWith time – and a few more signposts – those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\".\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The psychology behind why children are hooked on Minecraft\n\n1 day ago Share Save Chris Baraniuk Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nMinecraft is the world's best-selling computer game and soon to be a Hollywood film. This is why children can't get enough of it.\n\nAJ Minotti has three children – and they all love playing Minecraft. His twin girls aged 10 and his six-year-old son are constantly building stuff with the endless supply of virtual blocks that fill the game. And Minotti, who works in marketing in Ohio, sometimes gets blown away with what they come up with.\n\n\"Dad, I want to show you something,\" one of his daughters said to him recently as she held out the screen of her Nintendo Switch. Her avatar stood before a waterfall. After pressing an in-game button, the waterfall stopped, revealing the entrance to a cave. Inside was a subterranean super-lair complete with interactive lighting and display areas for items that she had collected in the game.\n\n\"It was like this whole underground mansion, basically,\" says Minotti, marvelling. \"I was super impressed by it.\" His daughter had followed some YouTube tutorials but also came up with much of the design herself. \"It takes me back to the feelings I had when I was a kid just hacking away on a computer,\" says Minotti.\n\nMinecraft is one of the most popular video games of all time. First released in 2009, it had sold more than 300 million copies by 2023. It, and similar games including Roblox and Terraria, are enjoyed by gamers of all ages, from young children to adults.\n\nThe game seems able absorb the attention of children for up to hours at a time – no mean feat in our distraction-filled age. Some parents fear their children's interest in Minecraft can border on obsession, or even addiction, as they struggle to tear them away from the computer screen.\n\nMinecraft's popularity is such that it has now spawned a highly anticipated Hollywood film called A Minecraft Movie, starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, which is due to be released in April 2025.\n\nThere could be deep psychological – even evolutionary – factors behind the success of Minecraft and games like it, say experts. Such games tap into an innate instinct within all of us – one that underpins the success of our entire species. The desire to build.\n\nWarner Bros Minecraft has now been turned into a hotly anticipated, star-studded Hollywood film (Credit: Warner Bros)\n\nIf you think about it, children have always enjoyed making things – sandcastles, forts, treehouses – to name a few. Consider also wooden blocks, playdough and Lego pieces. Minecraft is, arguably, just a recent iteration of this kind of play, but in a digital space. But why is building things so irresistible for many children in the first place?\n\nAll mammals play when they're young, says Peter Gray, a psychologist who studies children's ways of learning at Boston College, in Massachusetts, US. Predatory animals, for example, play at catching things. Prey animals practise dodging and darting.\n\n\"They play at the skills that are most important for them to develop for their survival and ultimate ability to mate,\" says Gray. Humans are unlike other animals in that we owe much of our survival to our ability to build stuff – from mud huts to tools for hunting and gathering. \"It's not surprising that natural selection endowed young people with a strong drive to play at building things,\" says Gray.\n\nHe notes that children also play using language and imagination, or make games that have rules and social interaction at their heart – all seemingly as part of preparation for adulthood.\n\nWhat youngsters choose to build during playtime, and how they build it, tends to reflect the culture they live in, says Gray. \"We should not be at all surprised that kids are really drawn to playing on computers today – nor should that distress us,\" he says. \"Kids know in their bones, in their instincts I would say, that these are the skills [they] need to develop.\"\n\nMinecraft players tend to differ from the population at large, being substantially more curious and less driven by traits such as vengeance\n\nJulian Togelius, a computer scientist at New York University, has noticed the impulse to build things emerging in his son – who is not even three years old. At nursery, he immediately starts making tunnels so that he can drive toy trains and trucks through them, explains Togelius. When his son gets a bit older, computers might become irresistible. Crucially, sandbox games ­– video games such as Minecraft that offer players the freedom to explore their creativity without any particular goal – make it easy to interact with and do things on computers, says Togelius.\n\n\"In Minecraft world, creating [something] is direct and simple,\" he explains. \"It's way easier than writing code.\" In other words, games like this satisfy the innate urge to build when computers, traditionally, might otherwise hinder that impulse, especially for children.\n\nAnd yet constructive play isn't the only draw. While sandbox mode in the game lets players create with freedom, there's also Survival Mode, in which the gamer is tasked with fighting off enemies. Minotti also notes that there is a social side to the game too. When his kids can't meet up with their friends or cousins in-person, they can do so online: \"It becomes that virtual hangout space.\"\n\nMinecraft is perhaps better thought of as an arena or virtual playground within which children can find their own niche – since they can choose from a wide range of activities and play styles.\n\nTogelius has studied how gamers' behaviour in Minecraft reveals aspects of their personalities. He argues that, because of the freedom afforded to players, it is easier to express themselves in the game than in, say, the arcade classic Asteroids, where players shoot at incoming space rocks. As part of his study, Togelius and colleagues asked adult participants to answer a questionnaire that revealed details of their personalities. They then compared those results to how each participant played Minecraft. The participants' in-game behaviour correlated with certain traits.\n\n\"Independence is strongly predicted by not finishing the main quest in the game,\" says Togelius. Plus, people who expressed having deeply-held family values in their questionnaire responses seemed to unwittingly demonstrate that through their in-game activities. \"They build little homes and fortresses with fences and stuff.\" While Togelius hasn't repeated the study with children, he says he wouldn't be surprised if their personalities also manifested themselves in-game, too.\n\nHe also found that Minecraft players in their survey tended to differ from the population at large, being substantially more curious and less driven by traits such as vengeance.\n\nAlamy Minecraft is now among the highest-selling computer games ever released (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe breadth of possibilities in sandbox games helps to ensure wide appeal, says Bailey Brashears, a psychologist at Texas Tech University, who last year published a thesis on how Minecraft can be used as a psychological research tool. Brashears identified five distinct gameplay aspects. There's a social element, the opportunity to feel competent through combat or exploration-based play, engineering, creativity and finally survival-based gameplay.\n\n\"Most games, you're only going to get one or two of these elements,\" Brashears says. \"You'll get a game that's mostly social play and survival – like Fortnite,\" she says.\n\nOf course, the amount of time children spend playing Minecraft speaks to wider concerns around how much screen time they are getting in general. (Read this article by Melissa Hogenboom about why not all screen time is the same for children.)\n\nBut Minotti stresses that his children have varied playtime – they love outdoor activities such as basketball, as well as video games. But sometimes, he has to remind them not to play video games excessively and he also steps in to approve any online friend requests. \"We don't just set them free on the internet,\" he adds.\n\nThe NSPCC, a children's charity in the UK, has published advice on how to keep kids safe when playing Minecraft and games like it. There have been serious cases of child grooming and abuse in Minecraft. The chief executive of Roblox also recently sparked a fierce debate after saying parents should keep their children off his company's gaming platform if they are worried about them being exposed to harmful content through its games.\n\nOverall, Minotti is comfortable with the fact that his children spend plenty of time in Minecraft because he says he has clear oversight of what they're doing and because they use it so creatively. \"It's basically just a digital playground,\" he says.\n\nAlamy Players have been found to enter a state of intense focus known as \"flow\" when playing games such as Minecraft (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMinecraft's broad appeal also means it provides an opportunity to connect with people in new ways. University professors, for example, used Minecraft to carry out online learning sessions during the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic. And primary school teachers in Ireland have reported success in engaging entire classes of pupils via Minecraft Education – a version of the game designed for classroom activities – says Éadaoin Slattery, a lecturer in psychology at the Technological University of the Shannon Midwest. Her research, featuring interviews with 11 teachers in Ireland, was funded by Microsoft, which owns Minecraft.\n\nSlattery mentions one example of a teacher who decided to set up a game within Minecraft Education to help his students learn Gaelic. \"He talked about creating restaurants and different food in Minecraft – this would help the students learn different words,\" she says.\n\nSeparate research has found that using Minecraft in classrooms can heighten pupils' motivation for school tasks, problem-solving, reading and writing, among other skills. Perhaps educational activities in Minecraft are taking advantage of the \"flow state\", or high level of concentration and focus, that players enter when they become deeply engrossed in the game. This phenomenon is associated with lots of different activities but it is so prevalent among Minecraft fans that it has made them the subject of study. It is part of the reason why children can become so absorbed in the game while ignoring everything else that is going on around them.\n\nThat said, there is evidence that Minecraft is not universally engaging, and may have a gender imbalance. One study in Australia, which surveyed more than 700 parents, found that while 54% of boys aged three to 12 played Minecraft, only 32% of girls in that age group did. The study authors say that it is important for games and online platforms to engage girls just as much as boys – since those games help kids to develop the digital skills they will need later in life.\n\nAJ Minotti, for one, is not worried about his daughters struggling to get to grips with computers. \"Minecraft really has become their thing,\" he says. \"I have to ask them what's going on.\"\n\nAnd while his kids also enjoy making things with physical Lego bricks, for example, Minotti says they don't have room to store a tonne of Lego pieces at home. In the end, Minecraft offers an easy solution. \"It's just having all the Lego pieces you could ever imagine,\" he says.\n\n--\n\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\n\n1 day ago Share Save Lindsey Galloway Share Save\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs the list of nations issuing travel warnings to the US grows, some visitors are opting to boycott it entirely. Here's why many foreigners are changing their travel plans and what this could mean for Americans.\n\nAs President Donald Trump implements sweeping new policies, issues tariffs on longtime allies and leads an immigration crackdown, some international travellers are rethinking their travel plans to the US.\n\nThe cold shoulder has been particularly noticeable from the US's northern neighbour, Canada, which sends more than 20 million visitors to the country per year – more than any other nation. In response to Trump's proposed tariffs and repeated threats to annex the nation, former prime minister Justin Trudeau recently urged his fellow Canadians: \"Now is the time to choose Canada,\" adding, \"it might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.\"\n\nAlamy Justin Trudeau recently urged Canadians to stay in Canada instead of travelling to the US (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe appeal seems to have caught on, as many infuriated Canadians are now boycotting US holidays. In February, border crossings were down by more than 20%, according to Statistics Canada. The US Travel Association estimates that even a 10% reduction in Canadian visitors could result in $2.1bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\n\nWhile some Canadians are snubbing the US because of policy changes, others say they simply don't feel as safe as they once did.\n\n\"My partner and I decided not to go ahead with our planned vacations to the US this year,\" said Canadian travel journalist Kate Dingwall. \"I worry about the border and getting stuck somehow, especially with how prickly Trump is to Canada. There's just a sense of uneasiness around visiting America at the moment.\"\n\nKeith Serry, a writer and comedian based in Montreal, Quebec, cancelled five April appearances in New York City (including four shows at the upcoming New York City Fringe festival) due to the tense political situation.\n\n\"This decision will, of course, rob me of the opportunity to share my art with many of you in New York I've grown to know and love,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"That said, the honest truth is that I just don't feel safe travelling to the States right now. In addition, I feel a powerful disinclination to spending my money in any way that might aid the economy of a hostile state.\"\n\nAlamy Some international travellers have been inexplicably detained by US officials (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn recent months, some Canadians have faced tougher border security than ever before – even those with clean records and valid documents. One woman made international headlines as she was detained by ICE for two weeks in reportedly bleak conditions after her visa was revoked.\n\n\"We're a country that prides itself, imperfectly but intentionally, on values like inclusion, equity and human rights. When those values feel out of step with what's happening across the border, it becomes harder to justify participation,\" said Amar Charles Marouf, a Canadian citizen who works as a curator at the World Economic Forum. \"The political climate raises broader questions. What kind of treatment are we normalising? What assumptions are being made about who is welcome and who isn’t?\"\n\nIt's not that Canadians aren't traveling internationally; many are simply swapping their traditional destinations. Marouf says Mexico, South America and Europe all feel more welcoming at the moment. \"California will be there when this is all over, but I just feel like there's less risk going to Portugal instead,\" added Dingwall.\n\nSome international properties have seen a bump in traffic, directly attributable to Canadians now spurning the US. \"In the last several weeks, we've received 10-plus leads from Canadians seeking to relocate events from the United States this summer,\" said Diarmaid O'Sullivan, director of sales & marketing at Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club Bermuda. \"This is a mix of leisure travellers, including those planning weddings, and companies relocating business events. This represents an approximately 20% increase in forecasted revenue from the Canadian market.\"\n\nAlamy Ironically, the US had recently been touted as the world's top tourism market (Credit: Alamy)\n\nInterestingly, all of this is happening just as the US had been experiencing record growth in the travel and tourism sector. Marta Soligo, professor at UNLV and director of Tourism Research at the UNLV Office of economic development, points to The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC)'s 2024 Economic Impact Trends Report, which showed the US as the world's top travel and tourism market. Not only did the industry achieve an unprecedented economic impact of $2.36tn in the US, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projections indicate that the US economy will add more than 800,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\n\"Such numbers help us understand the importance of the sector in the US, showing that a decrease in tourism from top-origin countries could significantly damage the US economy,\" said Soligo. \"The consequences of these issues can impact both large US-based corporations, such as hotel chains, and small businesses alike.\"\n\nThe change in travel patterns is already having a tangible effect on the US economy. Tourism Economics recently updated its inbound US travel forecast from a predicted 8.8% growth, to a 5.1% decline, attributing the change to \"strained\" travel sentiment, \"sweeping tariffs\" and \"exchange rate shifts\" making travel to the US more expensive.\n\n\"The combination of travel bans and a reduction of US travel could have a material impact on tourism and economic development,\" said Jeff Le, former deputy cabinet secretary for the State of California and the state's federal coordinator during the first Trump Administration.\n\nAlamy International travellers to California contributed $24bn in 2023 (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn California alone, international visitors provided more than $24bn in local economies in 2023, reports Le. \"Losing this would likely hurt both people and local government funds,\" he said. \"It is harder to measure reputational loss, but I cannot imagine active boycotts help.\"\n\nWhile the broad impact of boycotting travel to the US could have substantial national and governmental effects, some advocacy organisations also warn that the loss of tourism dollars is most likely to be felt by individuals.\n\n\"It's US workers and small businesses who get affected by US travel boycotts,\" said Thomas F Goodwin, leader of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance. Goodwin notes that more than 99% of the US business and professional events industry is made up of small businesses, and more than 80% of all exhibitors are US and international small businesses. \"When international business travellers forgo coming to the US, everyone from exposition booth builders and general service contractors to venue caterers and individual skilled labourers suffer – not politicians or the government. Boycotts have a knock-on effect on hotels, taxis, restaurants, local entertainers, high street commerce and more.\"\n\nThere is also a cost that is harder to quantify: the global influence of American culture.\n\nAlamy Hotels, restaurants and local businesses are likely to feel the effect of travel boycotts (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"Visitor numbers declining in the US sends a signal that the US is losing its soft power – the influence it once held through openness, cultural leadership and global goodwill,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"If this trend continues, it may force tourism boards or even local governments to create counter narratives to win back trust. I am not sure if it will be effective, however, since at the end of the day, it is the policies of the government that give the ultimate direction and influence perception.\"\n\nSillaman notes that travel boycotts also have a long-term cost to culture, the economy and overall innovation. \"When academics, scientists, artists, designers and entrepreneurs start to choose other countries instead of US, the US is going to lose more than just visitors,\" she said. \"In the long term, it's going to lose its competitiveness, goodwill and it will turn into a closed society that stifles growth and innovation.\"\n\nAlamy Fewer travellers suggest the US may be losing its power and influence (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThis human impact of boycotts also shows up in a myriad of ways, noted Missouri lawyer John Beck. \"I've worked with hundreds of non-citizens over the last 15 years and seen firsthand how policies between governments can result in individuals – regular travellers, students, families – getting caught in the middle,\" he said. \"It's rarely about the politics. It's about missed weddings, lost business deals or being unable to visit a dying parent.\"\n\nBeck says he has worked with at least 80 clients who have either delayed or cancelled US travel due to real or perceived hostility over the past few years. This causes complications with split families, international companies who can't move talent quickly and lost business due to the lack of ease of movement. Even though the geopolitical stakes are high, there is a human aspect on both sides of the border.\n\n\"Most Americans have little to do with the policies that frustrate global travellers,\" he said. \"They just want safety, fairness and dignity. That's what we need to protect.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'This is the information age': How Microsoft founder Bill Gates mapped out the new internet era back in 1993\n\n1 day ago Share Save Greg McKevitt Share Save\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nGates and Paul Allen launched computing giant Microsoft 50 years ago. In 1993, he talked to the BBC about the online innovations that would define the 21st Century.\n\nWhen the BBC first broadcast an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in June 1993, there were thought to be only 130 websites in total. The BBC's venerable science programme Horizon was investigating the new \"Electronic Frontier\", in an era where \"information is starting to redefine our world, its geography and its economy\". Gates told the programme: \"This is the information age, and the computer is the tool of the information age and software is what will determine how easily we can get at all of that information.\" Viewers could send off a cheque for £2 and receive a transcript of the programme in the post.\n\nThe computer industry had already grown faster than any in history, but the key to future profits was creating something portable and user-friendly. The programme asked: \"Do we need endless information, or do they just need to sell it to us?\" In a world where a list of almost every website could fit on two sides of a sheet of paper, the world wide web did not even get a mention. However, the ideas explored in the programme are often far ahead of their time.\n\nWATCH: 'Microsoft is 10,000 people playing Nerf football at 2:00 AM. Microsoft is a cult'.\n\nIn the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allen set a goal of having a computer on every desk and in every home – all running Microsoft products, of course. They first met as children at a private school in Seattle, where they discovered a shared love of computers. Both went on to college but dropped out and created Microsoft, so-called because it provided microcomputer software.\n\nThe company's big break came in 1980 when Microsoft agreed to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company at the time. In a stroke of business genius, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to other manufacturers, spawning an industry of \"IBM-compatible\" personal computers which depended on its MS-DOS product. The money had begun to roll in – and to this day it has not yet stopped.\n\nWATCH: 'That vision of a computer in every home will absolutely be achieved': Bill Gates\n\nWhile Gates was the serious-minded computer nerd, Allen was his offbeat big brother. Allen worked at Microsoft until 1983, stepping away from the frontline following a diagnosis of blood cancer. He recovered to become a successful venture capitalist and, having held onto his share of the company, he was a fixture on the world's rich lists until his death in 2018 at the age of 65. He used his vast fortune to invest in his personal passions, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the Super Bowl in 2013.\n\nWhoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that you don't want them to know – Denise Caruso\n\nHis departure from Microsoft also meant that he had more time to perfect his guitar moves. Legendary music producer Quincy Jones even claimed in a magazine interview that Allen \"sings and plays just like Hendrix\". He said: \"I went on a trip on his yacht, and he had David Crosby, Joe Walsh, Sean Lennon... then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him – he's good, man.\" The design of Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture, which he founded, has been likened to a smashed guitar and was created by superstar architect Frank Gehry.\n\nGetty Images Paul Allen and Bill Gates met at school in Seattle, and co-founded Microsoft in 1975 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAllen jumped ship from Microsoft before products such as Windows, Excel and Word ever made it into the world's homes and offices. By the early 1990s, Gates' vision for networked computers sent sales and profits soaring. However, the pair's early dream of putting a computer running Microsoft software in every home and business was only half complete. Word processing and spreadsheets were lucrative, but Microsoft's relentless drive to expand needed new worlds to explore. The next step was to bring multimedia into people's homes, turning the personal computer into a communication device. It was the world of leisure so beloved by Allen that Gates needed to tap into.\n\n1,000 TV channels, and nothin' on\n\nGates acknowledged to the BBC in 1993 that \"the home will be a tougher frontier to conquer\". However, he was confident that Microsoft would succeed. \"If you take a time frame like 15 years or certainly 20 years, I have no doubt that the vision of a computer in every home, although it won't look like today's computer, will absolutely be achieved,\" he said.\n\nA year earlier, Bruce Springsteen had a hit grumbling about having \"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\". Undeterred by the Boss's cynicism, Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold talked of a future where we would have up to 1,000 television channels. He said: \"That might sound like a nightmare, but I think it's a wonderful thing. Imagine what your favourite bookstore would be like if there were only five books.\" Describing a system resembling today's streaming services, he spoke of an \"online interactive guide, which uses computer technology to organise the channels, show them to you by topic, even learn of the material that you like to watch, and then present it to you in an online fashion right on the television\".\n\nIn History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\nMyhrvold was providing a tantalising glimpse of the future: a world at your fingertips where you could order an En Vogue CD or Prince tickets instantly. But what would this mean for personal privacy?\n\nThere was a warning in the 1993 programme from Denise Caruso, editor of the magazine Digital Media: \"The ease of sitting in front of your interactive TV five years hence and being able to order something by pushing your remote control means information about you is going through a network. That means that whoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that maybe you don't want them to know.\"\n\nCaruso raised issues echoed in the current debate about Generative AI models being trained by devouring copyrighted material. She said: \"By making information a commodity, you really change the nature of how people think about ideas and their work and what they do. I am a writer. My stock in trade is ideas, and when you try to draw lines around what information is and where did an idea come from and who had that idea originally and what napkin was it originally drawn on, when you start moving information into that realm, it starts to get very fuzzy about where one person's idea stops and another one starts.\"\n\nShe said that while information was an incredible commodity, it had no value at all unless it could be protected. But how could you protect something that has no physical existence and could be copied or changed undetectably?\n\n\"The problem is that the solutions are as complex as the problems themselves. Do you want to lock up all the information? Absolutely not. We would have no scientific progress if scientists weren't able to freely exchange ideas and information. Do you just have a free-for-all and say all information is free? Well, you can't do that either because people do actually make their livings upon the fruit of their work, [which] is information, whether it's a book or it's a movie or it's music. I think technology is an incredible thing and it's very powerful, but it's powerful in both ways, and it's very important that we all understand that before we just embrace it.\"\n\nThe birth of email\n\nWhile the world wide web did not feature in the programme, it was many viewers' first introduction to the concept of electronic mail, or email. As Microsoft continued its voracious expansion, the company's human resources vice-president Mike Murray said that email \"creates an electronic village [which] allows us to transcend the borders of time or geographic barriers\". His words may seem grandiose now, but at the time it would have been a revolutionary idea that one could communicate instantly with someone or many people on the other side of the world without the need for an expensive international phone call.\n\nBy the end of 1993, the number of websites was estimated at 623, having doubled every three months. By the end of 1994, the figure was 10,022. Microsoft was seen by some commentators as being slow to acknowledge the possibilities and growth of the web, but in May 1995 Gates sent a memo to his senior staff titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave\", calling it \"the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981\". Three months later, Microsoft launched its web portal MSN alongside the release of Windows 95. Some versions had its brand-new Internet Explorer browser controversially bundled in. The future was again up for grabs, and Gates once again had some big thoughts on how he might conquer it.\n\n--\n\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\n\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking – not family expectations – that truly drew him in.\n\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\n\nHis parents were both in education – his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University – but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi became a household name after the opening of his restaurant in Notting Hill (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old chef – who has authored 11 cookbooks – tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\n\"My kids – I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old – they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\n\nFood should be healing rather than routine, says Ottolenghi\n\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi says his approach to cooking has changed as he's seen the public's shifting attitudes to food (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill café and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\n\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.\n\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\n\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook – when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\n\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective – used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Pads, pants or cups: Which period product is the most climate-friendly?\n\n6 March 2025 Share Save Ana Santi Share Save\n\nGetty Images There is a huge selection of period products to choose from, ranging from disposable tampons to reusable menstrual cups (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nTwenty billion disposable menstrual products are discarded each year in the US. There's a huge array of reusable options, from pads to pants to menstrual cups. Ana Santi explores which is the most sustainable and how safe they are.\n\nDuring a weekend away with my girlfriends a few years ago, one of them mentioned that she was wearing period pants, an environmental decision to move away from single-use pads and tampons. I'd vaguely heard of them, but didn't know anyone who wore them and I'd always been a little sceptical – would they be absorbent enough? My friend convinced me otherwise and they've remained my product of choice ever since. But as I browse the shelves of menstrual products in my local supermarket today, I'm overwhelmed by the choice available: so many pads and tampons (some organic, most not), numerous types of cups, a few period pants.\n\nI set out to find the most sustainable period product available.\n\nGiven that 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate every month, a group of academics based in France and the US conducted a life-cycle assessment of menstrual products across four product groups: disposable non-organic and organic pads and tampons (with applicators); reusable pads; period underwear; and menstrual cups, which are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and can hold 20-30ml (around two tablespoons) of menstrual blood. Comparing eight environmental impact indicators – global warming potential, fossil resources, land use, water use, carcinogenic effects, ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication – and conducted over one year across three countries (France, India and the US), the assessment considers impacts from production to disposal.\n\nAcross all the three countries and environmental impacts, the menstrual cup was a clear winner, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. Small and lightweight, one person's menstrual cup can last up to 10 years.\n\nDisposable pads – both organic and non-organic – had the highest impacts across all eight categories except water use, with non-organic pads scoring the highest for global warming potential and resource depletion. The global warming potential – greenhouse gas emissions' ability to absorb heat and warm the atmosphere over a given time period – came from manufacturing, with almost half of the impact from production of polyethylene (a petroleum-based plastic). But one of the most surprising results – not least to the report's authors – was that organic cotton pads had the highest impact of all, across five categories.\n\n\"The impacts are mostly linked to raw material manufacturing and organic production, which can have higher environmental impacts,\" explains Mélanie Douziech, one of the study's co-authors from Mines Paris-PSL university. The yield of organic farming is lower than conventional farming, meaning more water and land is needed to produce the same amount of organic as conventional cotton. Similar results were found for organic and non-organic cotton tampons.\n\nGetty Images In the US, 20 billion disposable period products are discarded each year (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nDepending on the product, different parts of the lifecycle influence the emissions. \"For disposable products, it's the raw material production and manufacturing, as a lot of these products have plastics in them, which have quite a large global warming impact,\" says Douziech. \"With reusable products, it is the manufacturing and use phases, especially the electricity requirements.\"\n\nWater and electricity are needed to wash all reusable products between wear, but period pants perform better than reusable pads, in part because otherwise another form of underwear would be worn – and washed – regardless. \"Even though the menstrual cup is a clear winner, period underwear is also an alternative product that really reduces the environmental impacts,\" says Douziech. How we care for them can also affect the overall impact, such as washing at lower temperatures and as part of a full load.\n\nThe assessment did not consider plastic pollution, but according to the study each conventional pad, including wrappers, wings and adhesives, adds some 2g of non-biodegradable plastic – the equivalent of four plastic bags – to the environment and take an estimated 500 to 800 years to decompose. The study adds that, in the US, 80% of conventional tampons and 20% of conventional pads are flushed down toilets, blocking sewers and releasing microplastics into oceans.\n\nPrior to this report, an analysis of several life-cycle analyses comparing the environmental impacts of menstrual products, including emissions and resource depletion, was commissioned by the UN Environment Programme in 2021. Co-author Philippa Notten, director of the Cape Town-based non-profit TGH Think Space, which focuses on energy, climate change and sustainability projects, says that, due to a lack of data, the impact of plastic at menstrual products' end of life is not well documented in life-cycle assessments. \"Plastic tends to get modelled as if it ends up in a landfill or incinerator. Counterintuitively, landfill actually looks good from a carbon footprint point of view because plastic takes hundreds of years to degrade, so those carbon emissions are locked up in the landfill, which acts like a carbon sink,\" she says. \"In reality, the product doesn't always end up in a formal waste management stream; it ends up as litter on beaches, as microplastics in the sea. And there is still a lot of carbon in the production of plastics.\"\n\nIn UNEP's report, the menstrual cup also comes out on top by a considerable margin. \"It's quite rare for this to happen to a product,\" Notten says. \"It's not that the cup doesn't have a carbon footprint, but because it's such a small, light product, the impact is also small relative to other products.\"\n\n\"We always talk about 'break even points' in these studies: how many times do you have to use a renewable product before it has made up for the emissions caused in its manufacturing and use phases, compared to a single-use product?\" Notten says. \"For many products, it's often really high, like 100 times. With a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint.\"\n\nBoth studies express the importance of context and highlight that greenhouse gas emissions are only one of the many consequences of products and processes. \"No matter what we do, we are going to have an impact, but the idea is to minimise this impact as much as possible,\" says Paula Pérez-López, co-author of the France and US study and a researcher at Mines Paris-PSL university.\n\nThe life-cycle assessment recommends that women consider factors beyond environmental impact, including social and cultural attitudes and infrastructures. \"This was out of our field of environmental assessment expertise, but in some African countries, reusable products, in particular menstrual cups, could be the difference between going to school and not for some girls, who don't have access to a period product,\" says Pérez-López. \"Of course, the problem of access extends to all kinds of products, but a menstrual cup could be much easier to access because it's a small product that lasts a long time.\"\n\nGetty Images The menstrual cup was ranked the most environmentally-friendly product in a life-cycle assessment (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBut recent reports have warned of the consequences of a poorly fitted, incorrectly sized menstrual cup, with one woman developing temporary kidney problems and some women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse. Shazia Malik, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Portland Hospital in London, is reluctant to recommend menstrual cups to teenagers unless they are carefully taught how to use and care for them. \"In the last eight years, I've seen patients – women and teenagers – who use menstrual cups develop infections,\" she says. \"If you don't insert [the cup] properly, it can compress the bladder or rectum, and it won't effectively collect menstrual blood.\"\n\nMalik also warns of the dangers of using the same menstrual cup for many years. Her advice is to have two cups on the go, sterilise them after each use – including every morning and night – and to replace them as soon as there is any wear and tear. \"We also need more awareness on choosing the right menstrual cup size, depending on your flow and whether you've had a vaginal birth. With education, the menstrual cup is a fantastic period product,\" Malik says.\n\nWith a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint – Philippa Notten\n\nIn the UK, the Women's Environmental Network, a non-profit, is calling for a Menstrual Health, Dignity and Sustainability Act to combat period poverty, environmental waste and toxic chemicals found in period products. WEN cites a new policy in the Spanish region of Catalonia as an example to follow. From March 2024 all women in Catalonia were given access to free, reusable menstrual products.\n\nAmong the network's concerns is a US study that detected 16 types of metals, including lead, in tampons, and a report by Which?, a UK consumer magazine, which found \"unnecessarily high levels of silver\" in some period pants, used as an antimicrobial agent to combat concerns about smell and hygiene.\n\nHelen Lynn, a campaign manager focusing on the environmental impacts of menstrual products at WEN, says that such chemicals are harmful to human health and the environment, with innovation happening faster than regulation. \"[The life-cycle assessment] is an interesting study but it doesn't take into account chemical residues and additives in menstrual products because businesses aren't obliged to disclose them, so studies like these can only look at the main materials disclosed by manufacturers,\" she says. \"A lack of transparency means that people don't know what's in these products and they put them next to a very absorbent part of the body.\"\n\nGetty Images The water and electricity needed to wash reusable period products also needs to be taken into consideration (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Vermont became the first US state to adopt a new law to ban the \"forever chemicals\" PFAs in menstrual products, while a bill led by New York congresswoman Grace Meng calls for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the make-up of menstrual products.\n\nMarina Gerner, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of The Vagina Business, would welcome a US equivalent to the EU Ecolabel, but is calling for a global initiative. \"Companies need to disclose the ingredients of their period products and toxic ingredients need to be banned by regulators,\" Gerner says. \"The reason this hasn't happened yet is because women's health has historically been under researched and underfunded. The modern tampon was invented in 1931 and the first study on metal levels in tampons was only published last year.\"\n\nSeveral years ago, I switched to mostly using period pants. They last between two to three years and cost about £45 ($56.7) for three pairs. At approximately £2.75 ($3.48) for a pack of 10 pads, and using two packs per month, I would have spent up to £200 ($252.7) on pads in the same period. A menstrual cup is approximately £20 ($25.2) and, for people comfortable using tampons, it is relatively easy to insert, but removal, cleansing and re-insertion when away from home or in public toilets can make it less accessible.\n\nAs a regular swimmer, I plan to try period swimwear next, although the possibility of leakage makes me anxious (I've been assured by people who wear them that this doesn't happen). Even though the life-cycle assessment ranked disposable organic products as the worst environmental offender, on occasions when period pants aren't convenient, I use a disposable, organic cotton, plastic-free and compostable brand that you can discard in your food bin (it is readily available in supermarkets and health stores). Pérez-López says that the study did not model composting at end-of-life. \"This would need to be investigated further.\"\n\nWhen trying to make better environmental choices, it is rare to find a relative silver bullet, like the menstrual cup. But I think that most people who are in a position to choose their menstrual products would prefer a range of options. \"And that is a great solution,\" says Pérez-López. \"Choose a reusable product when you can, but if you're uncomfortable using a certain type of product for your whole cycle, or you can't rely on a reusable product for a particular reason, combine several products. You will still be making a difference.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "Mālama: The word embodying the spirit of Hawaii\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Kate Eshelby Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMeaning \"to give back\", this ancient concept is a way of life – and a tourism initiative offering travellers fascinating local experiences and perks.\n\nI watched as smooth, purple poi streamed from the grinder, filling a large bucket in the centre of the small room. Earlier, I'd scraped away the rough skin of taro (the Pacific's answer to the potato), washing and cubing them with a knife. From a raised ledge, two men waited to grind it into the thick, starchy paste that has sustained generations of Hawaiians.\n\nMy husband, children and I were at the Waipā Foundation headquarters; a nonprofit on Kaua'i's lush North Shore dedicated to land conservation and reviving traditional agricultural practices. Waipā exemplifies the ancient Hawaiian concept of mālama (\"to care for\") which encourages visitors to give back to the environment and local communities through activities like habitat restoration, beach cleanups or food provision. But Mālama goes beyond eco-tourism: it's about leaving a place better than you found it. And after seeking out these experiences during a three-week stay, we found mālama not only improves Hawaii, it also made our time there much more meaningful.\n\nAlamy From restoring native forests to preparing poi, Hawaii is full of mālama-inspired volunteer experiences (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWe had begun the morning sipping traditional māmaki tea and eating homemade banana bread in the sunshine, as Waipā's guide, Kelsey Ke'alohilani Rogers, shared the legend of kalo (taro in Hawaiian) and how this root vegetable became an iconic part of Hawaiian culture. According to local beliefs, Earth Mother and Sky Father had a stillborn son. From the spot where he was buried, the first kalo plant grew, later nourishingtheir next son, Hāloa, the first human. \"This is why kalo is more than food; it's family,\" Rogers explained.\n\nThe best of 2025 Hawaii was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\n\nBut keeping this sacred staple on Hawaiian tables is becoming harder. Land in Hawaii is expensive, and the high cost of living requires many families to work multiple jobs, which is why Waipā gives nutrient-rich poi away or sells it at cost to locals.\n\n\"Here, you're not just learning – you're supporting people by producing affordable food,\" Rogers added. \"Simply paying for knowledge is extractive, but this is reciprocal.\" Waipā offers several food and farm tours, as well as a monthly volunteer morning to help with agroforestry, reforestation and removing invasive weeds.\n\nThe roots of mālama run deep. Hawaii is the most isolated archipelago on Earth, a volcanic cluster of eight main islands, marooned 2,390 miles south-west of California. Centuries before mass tourism, Hawaiians thrived under a sustainable resource management system known as ahupua'a. As she spoke, Rogers traced her finger along a colourful paper map showing how everything was interlinked from the mountains to the sea: what happened upland affected the reefs, waterways and forest. Mālama 'āina (caring for the land) has always been a deeply ingrained Hawaiian value – a fact the Mālama programme's participants are keen to teach visitors today.\n\nAlamy Mālama 'āina was the law of the land before mass tourism (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"Living on these distant islands meant we had to be self-sufficient and understand our environment,\" she said. \"The Western world was different – it just conquered and took what it needed.\"\n\nNow, generations after Hawaii became a US state in 1959 and the rise of jet travel propelled this \"Paradise of the Pacific\" to become a major tourist destination, many Hawaiians and local residents believe a return to the islands' traditional ways is long overdue.\n\n\"Mālama today is more vital than ever,\" Rogers said. \"Too many tourists trample over our land, ignoring restrictions and damaging sensitive ecosystems… Don't just think Hawaii is beautiful; help keep it that way. It's a shared responsibility.\" As Rogers explained, mālama isn't about seeing or appreciating a landscape; it invites visitors to connect and contribute to it, with the idea that caring for a place fosters a stronger relationship with it.\n\n\"Most tourists leave never knowing anything about our culture,\" she continued. \"Despite what many think, it's not just about going to a lū'au or surfing.\"\n\nNearby, outside the poi mill in the Waipā base, I listened to the rhythmic sound of singing as Hawaiians joined hands in a piko (circle), symbolising connection, to bless the food.\n\nAlamy The Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, where the first season of The White Lotus was filmed, is part of the Mālama programme (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs part of the initiative, we stayed at two hotels that encourage mālama: the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, which offers a free fifth night if guests participate in a beach cleanup; and 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay. Both properties highlight mālama-focused experiences in their daily programmes, partnering with organisations like the National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Surfrider Foundation, Waipā and the Kaua'i Humane Society. Our youngest was especially keen to try the latter, which lets visitors adopt a shelter dog for the day and take it out exploring.\n\n\"For many, Hawaii is just a playground, a Disneyland,\" a lifeguard by the Hyatt hotel pool told me. \"A huge number of homes have become holiday rentals, pushing locals out. If tourism is going to work here, it must benefit the local community.\"\n\nAfter volunteering at the Waipā Foundation, we visited Common Ground, also on Kaua'i's North Shore – a regenerative farm that was once a sugar plantation, and which encourages mālama 'āina. We joined one of its food and feast tours, where guests are shown around before sharing a meal that celebrates the island's bounty.\n\n\"Monoculture plantations like sugar were run by big companies that came to our islands, stripped the soil bare, and then left,\" our guide, Sophia Reinheimer, explained. But this farm is different: here, the soil is nurtured through regenerative practices, such as planting diverse crops rather than just one. All of the ingredients used in the food served come from Kaua'i – either grown on the farm itself or sourced from nearby producers. That's rare in Hawaii, where 90% of the food is imported.\n\nKate Eshelby The author's family took part in a lei-making workshop (Credit: Kate Eshelby)\n\n\"Mālama also means eating responsibly, choosing ocean-friendly restaurants and shopping at the many farmers'markets,\" Reinheimer added. But it extends beyond food – supporting local businesses and buying locally made souvenirs has a positive impact, too.\n\nWe also took part in a newly launched lei-making workshop in Common Ground's lush garden. As we twisted ti leaves into a lei hili (a rope-like lei), our teacher, Ivory Lloyd, shared the deeper significance behind the tradition. \"Lei making is the ultimate expression of aloha (the Hawaiian belief that all things, people and nature, are connected and deserve love),\" she said. \"It connects us to the land; we honour the plants we use and ask permission before picking them.\"\n\nYet, like many aspects of Hawaiian culture, traditional lei-making faced obstacles. After Hawaii's 1898 annexation by the US, many cultural practices – including the Hawaiian language and hula – were banned. It wasn't until the Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1960s that these traditions began to revive, and today, mālama plays a role in keeping them alive.\n\nMaile Brown from the Kaua'i Visitors Bureau told me how the mālama programme began. \"After Covid, we saw how much healthier the land was without the crowds,\" she said. \"We wanted to redefine tourism, to encourage greater respect for Hawaii's people and place.\"\n\nAlamy Visitors can volunteer at Limahuli Garden & Preserve on Kaua'i (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhat began as a list of participating businesses has evolved into a broader initiative, offering visitors opportunities to either volunteer during their stay, or engage with local businesses and nonprofits that embody mālama. Since Covid, the islands' message to visitors remains simple: come as you would into someone's home, and if you're willing, here's how you can help care for it.\n\n\"Tourism is about education,\" Brown continued. \"If you leave understanding the complexity and beauty of a place, you develop a reverence for it.\" While volunteering is one way to practise mālama, learning about Hawaii is just as essential. \"It's about perpetuating local culture,\" she continued. \"This is our kuleana, our responsibility.\" Then, she added, with a smile, \"Of course, be sure to enjoy the island's beauty, the variety of activities – just put mālama into the mix, and in your heart.\"\n\nOn another day, we joined the Surfrider Foundation, which organises beach cleanups for volunteers, including tourists. We were the only non-locals, so as we collected plastic, we talked about island life. At the end, as a rainbow revealed itself above, we shared homemade cookies and cupcakes. Our sons enjoyed exploring the beach while filling hessian sacks, and, under supervision, helped to cut the discarded ropes. It was shocking to learn that more than 52 metric tonnes of debris enter Hawaii every year – much of it from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with almost half composed of commercial fishing waste.\n\nOn our last day on Kaua'i, we went to Limahuli Garden & Preserve. While we chose to wander on our own, guided tours (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 09:00) highlight its conservation work. \"We steward a modern ahupua'a,\" volunteer coordinator Sonia Adame said. Visitors can volunteer too, removing invasive species or planting in the nursery.\n\nKate Eshelby Greg Solitario and his son, Devak, press their foreheads and noses together in the ancient Hawaiian greeting (Credit: Kate Eshelby)\n\nAfter eight days on Kauai'i, we ventured to Molokai, the least visited of all the Hawaiian Islands. There are no resorts, no chain stores, no billboards – just swirling seas at the foot of some of the world's tallest cliffs, forests of flaming red ʻōhiʻa trees and candy-coloured clapboard churches.\n\nWe travelled deep into Hālawa Valley on the island’s far eastern edge to visit Greg Solatario, a native Hawaiian cultural practitioner who lives off-grid on the land his ancestors have stewarded for centuries. Solatario embodies mālama – committed to nurturing the land and preserving Hawaiian culture. After welcoming us into his home, he led us through long-abandoned villages lost to the jungle and moss-cloaked heiau (temples).\n\nAs we approached, his son, Devak stepped out to greet us and blew a conch shell, which his father answered with another. \"This is to ask permission before entering the land,\" he explained.\n\nBut it was his parting words that lingered longest: mālama can, and should, be a global value, not just a Hawaiian one.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "National Rally leader Marine Le Pen has vowed to fight a Paris court’s decision to ban her from standing in the upcoming presidential election, accusing the judiciary of acting politically and attempting to undermine the people’s sovereignty.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, magistrates in Paris on Monday sentenced former presidential candidate Marine Le Pen to a five-year ban from standing for any political office in France after finding her guilty of embezzlement over the alleged use of European Union funds for her populist National Rally party at the EU Parliament for political activities in France. Crucially, the judges sided with demands for prosecutors to enact the ban immediately and for it to remain in place during any appeal, making it likely that the prohibition would remain in force during the 2027 presidential race to replace Emmanuel Macron, who will be term-limited from running again for the presidency.\n\nLe Pen, the undisputed frontrunner in the polls for the presidential race, has claimed the ruling is something usually seen in “authoritarian regimes”, arguing that the presumption of innocence is typically returned to those in France who launch appeals against convictions. Therefore, the ban on her from running for office during the appeal process violates the rule of law, she asserted.\n\n“This evening, there are millions of French people who are indignant, indignant to an unimaginable point, seeing that, in France, in the country of human rights, judges have implemented practices that we believed reserved for authoritarian regimes,” the National Rally leader said in an interview on Monday evening according to Le Figaro.\n\nDespite previously claiming that such a ban would represent a “political death sentence”, Le Pen has vowed to fight the ruling and said that she would not allow the French election to be “stolen” by the judiciary.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday morning, she said that her party “will not let this happen” and will defend the rights of the French people, who she said “have the right to vote for whoever they wish.”\n\n“The system took out the nuclear bomb. If they use such a powerful weapon against us, it’s because we’re about to win the elections… We will not let the French have the presidential election stolen. We will use all the means at our disposal to allow the French to choose their future leaders, and we will win, because truth and justice must win.”\n\nLe Pen noted that even longstanding political opponents have criticised the ruling, including far-left La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who said on Monday that “the decision to dismiss an elected official should go to the people” and warned that stripping Le Pen of the presumption of innocence during the appeal process “wouldn’t be just”.\n\nThe leader of the centrist Les Républicains in the National Assembly parliament, Laurent Wauquiez, was also critical of the ban on his political opponent, saying: “It is not healthy that in a democracy an elected official is prohibited from running in an election. Political debates must be decided at the ballot box; it is the French who must decide. This decision will have a very heavy weight on the functioning of our democracy. This is probably not the path we should have taken.”\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who also has previously been at odds with Le Pen, said: “I do not know the merits of the accusations against Marine Le Pen, nor the reasons for such a strong decision… But I think that no one with democracy at heart can rejoice in a sentence that hits the leader of a major party and deprives millions of citizens of representation.” Meanwhile, Meloni deputy Matteo Salvini, described the ruling against Le Pen as an “act of war” from Brussels against the rising populist movement in Europe.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump also commented on the ruling from the Oval Office, describing it as a “big deal.”\n\n“She was banned for running for five years, and she’s the leading candidate. That sounds like this country,” Trump quipped, referring to lawfare attempts to prevent his recent election.\n\nWhile Le Pen acknowledged that the path to the Elysee Palace for her is now “narrow”, given that the appeal must be completed before the 2027 election, she said that she will push forward and that the ruling “in no way” means the end of her political career. Despite the ruling, the National Rally leader can remain in her seat in the National Assembly, giving her a large platform to wage the fight against the judiciary.\n\nSitting alongside her on during Tuesday’s press conference, Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s longstanding right-hand man and eventual successor, said: “The duty of the National Rally, like that of all patriotic voters, is to be united and mobilized, alongside the woman whose only crime is to have found herself in a position to win the presidential election. This is not the time to give up!”.",

        "content": "Canada slapped 25 percent tariffs on about 1,800 American products in March, and will implement 4,400 more on April 2, the day President Donald Trump plans to announce higher tariffs against every country that taxes U.S. imports.\n\nMany of Canada’s tariffs are bizarrely targeted at imports that are virtually nonexistent, leading critics to suspect the list has been padded with nonsense to make the Canadian response look much tougher than it really is.\n\nCTV on Sunday listed some of the “odd and obscure” imports targeted by Canada, including “flamethrowers, false beards, church bell cases, and live monkeys,” plus “manatee meat and passenger drones.”\n\nCanadians will soon find themselves paying more for imported American accordion parts, emus, bovine semen, and clothing made with asbestos fibers. Toronto residents who dreamed of reaching the stars with an American-made spaceship will pay 25 percent more to make their dreams come true. Ottawa diarists will have to pay 25 percent more if they want to record their daily adventures in a diary imported from the United States.\n\n“Why would you list such a plethora of small, obscure products? I think it’s being driven by the need to produce visible optics, and so they can say, ‘Look, we’ve got 6,200 (items), we’re really going at this, we’re really sticking it to Donald Trump and the Americans,” said professor Ian Lee of the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University.\n\n“These are not consumer goods that are turning over in high volumes. They’re low-volume purchases, which tells me they’re going to have a small impact on Canadians if only a small number are buying them on any given day,” he said.\n\n“I will say, manatee meat isn’t something we can make ourselves, but I don’t think it will create too much of a backlash from Canadian consumers,” University of Regina economics professor Jason Childs wryly noted.\n\nChilds may be underselling the pain that will soon be faced by Canadian gourmands, as not only imported manatee meat will be socked with higher tariffs but also American-grown camel and primate meat. Canada’s fledgling camel-burger industry will tremble on the verge of extinction.\n\nOf course, not everything getting hit with retaliatory tariffs is a bizarre niche product, and Canada is employing other strategies to fight the trade war.\n\nCBC reported on Sunday that the Canadian government is purchasing billboards in Republican-voting states, and the District of Columbia, with messages such as, “Tariffs Are a Tax On Your Grocery Bill,” “Tariffs Are a Tax At the Gas Pump,” and “Tariffs Are a Tax On Hard-Working Americans.”\n\nAn alert correspondent in Columbus, Georgia, noticed that the Canadians made the small mistake of printing half of their billboard messages in French, a language not widely spoken in most U.S. cities. Other critics found the billboard messages amusingly overwrought, since American consumers are not nearly as dependent upon imports from the north as the Canadian government is hoping.",

        "content": "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker has carried an all-night speech in protest of President Donald Trump’s agenda into a new day\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker speaks through the night to protest Trump’s agendaBy MIKE CATALINIAssociated PressThe Associated Press\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker carried an all-night speech in protest of President Donald Trump’s agenda into Tuesday morning.\n\nBooker took to the Senate floor on Monday evening saying he would remain there as long as he was “physically able.” He was still on the floor more than 14 hours later.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker said at the start of his speech. “And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”\n\nBooker railed against cuts to Social Security offices led by Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and spoke to concerns that broader cuts to the social safety net could be coming, though Republican lawmakers say the program won’t be touched.\n\nDonning and doffing reading glasses, Booker read what he said were letters from constituents. One writer was alarmed by the Republican president’s talk of annexing Greenland and Canada and a “looming constitutional crisis.”\n\n“I hear you. I see you, and I’m standing here in part because of letters like yours,” Booker said.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Booker got some help from Democratic colleagues, who gave him a break from speaking to ask him a question. Booker said he would yield for questions but would not give up the Senate floor.\n\nAccording to the Senate’s website, the record for the longest individual speech belongs to Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nBooker invoked Thurmond and the civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Tuesday morning, arguing that changing history would require the public to get involved.\n\n“You think we got civil rights one day because Strom Thurmond — after filibustering for 24 hours — you think we got civil rights because he came to the floor one day and said, ‘I’ve seen the light,’” Booker said. ”No, we got civil rights because people marched for it, sweat for it and John Lewis bled for it.”\n\nBooker, 55, is serving his second term in the Senate. He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2020, when he launched his campaign from the steps of his home in Newark. He dropped out after struggling to gain a foothold in a packed field, falling short of a threshold to meet in a January 2020 debate.\n\nBefore taking to the national political stage, Booker was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, serving as mayor of Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, from 2006 to 2013. A Rhodes Scholar and graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law, he started his career as an attorney for nonprofits. He served on the Newark City Council before becoming the city’s mayor.\n\nHe was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2013 during a special election held after the death of incumbent Democrat Frank Lautenberg. He won his first full-term in 2014 and then reelection in 2020.\n\nBooker was at the helm in Newark when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced a $100 million donation to improve the city’s schools in 2010. Roughly a decade ago, Zuckerberg told the AP a major lesson from Newark being applied in later donations was to make sure the desires of the public are considered.\n\n___\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, N.J.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday evening ordered the military services to set sex-neutral physical fitness standards for combat arms, reversing more than a decade of the erosion of standards in hopes of recruiting more women.\n\n“For far too long, we allowed standards to slip, and different standards for men and women in combat arms, [military occupational specialties] and jobs, that’s not acceptable,” Hegseth said in a video on his official plane flying back from Japan before signing a memo to implement the order.\n\n“We need to have the same standard, male or female, in our combat roles to ensure our men and women who are [in] those formations have the best possible leaders and the highest possible standards that are not based at all on your sex, if you’re a man or a woman,” he added. “Soon we’ll have nothing but the highest and equal standards for men and women in combat.\n\nHegseth’s memo directed the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to develop comprehensive plans to distinguish combat arms occupations from non-combat arms occupations in order to identify which positions require “heightened entry level and sustained physical fitness.”\n\n“These roles, which are critical to our military’s mission success, demand exceptional physical capabilities, and the standards for them must reflect that rigor,” wrote Hegseth, who is an Army National Guard veteran, served in combat, and is himself physically fit.\n\nHegseth habitually does physical training with troops while on travel to overseas U.S. military bases, as a way to touch base with troops and lead by example. He also participated in a charity swim with Navy SEALs before becoming defense secretary.\n\nHegseth outlined three guidelines.\n\nFor ground combat operations, he said standards should emphasize the ability to carry heavy loads, endure prolonged physical exertion, and perform effectively in austere, hostile environments. “Service members in these roles must exhibit speed, strength, agility, and endurance to navigate the demands of combat situations,” he said.\n\nFor special operations forces, he said the standards must be “equally rigorous, incorporating advanced swimming, climbing, parachuting, and the ability to operate in extreme environments. … Sustained peak physical performance is essential to execute missions of the highest stakes across diverse and challenging terrains.”\n\nFor specialized occupations like Navy Divers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians, he said the focus should be on proficiency in those unique and demanding tasks such as aquatic rescue, repair, and demolition. “Sustained endurance is necessary to tackle long hours in physically and mentally taxing conditions,” he said.\n\nHe said all entry-level and sustained physical fitness requirements within combat arms positions must be sex-neutral — “based solely on the operational demands of the occupation and the readiness needed to confront any adversary.”\n\nHegseth asked the secretaries to submit their proposals to the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness within 60 days of the memo’s signing, with an interim update within 30 days, and full implementation of the plans within six months of submission.\n\n“This initiative aligns with my broader directive to maintain uncompromising and clear standards that ensure the continued dominance of our military,” he said.\n\nChief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell — a combat Army veteran and former Ranger — said in a post on X:\n\nFor too long, the U.S. military has let standards slip for men & women serving in combat arms jobs. Under President Trump & Secretary Hegseth’s leadership, our standards will be high, uniform, uncompromising, & clear.\n\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on X, Truth Social, or on Facebook.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The Conservative opposition in Canada demanded Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney fire a Toronto-area candidate, Paul Chiang, for suggesting that an anti-Communist Conservative named Joe Tay should be handed over to the brutal Chinese government in exchange for a bounty on dissidents.\n\nTay is an immigrant from Hong Kong who has been critical of the Beijing-controlled puppet government on the island. Under the authoritarian “national security law” imposed by China to crush the Hong Kong democracy movement in 2020, criticizing the government is an illegal act of “sedition.”\n\n“If anyone here can take [Tay] to the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto, you can get the million-dollar reward,” Chiang told a Chinese-language press conference in January.\n\nTay was running against Chiang in the district of Markham-Unionville at the time but is now the candidate for a different district. Chiang has been a Member of Parliament (MP) from Markham-Unionville since 2021. The bounty offered by the Chinese Communist Party for dissidents was $1 million in Hong Kong dollars, which works out to about $184,000 Canadian.\n\nThe demand for Carney to dismiss Chiang came from Conservative Michael Chong, who has been targeted by Chinese election interference for his own criticism of the Communist regime. Chong is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party for Wellington-Halton Hills North and has previously testified before the U.S. Congress about his own political persecution, noting that Chinese meddling in Canadian politics is a serious problem.\n\nA Canadian intelligence commission concluded in April 2024 that China “clandestinely and deceptively interfered in both the 2019 and 2021 elections” – both of which were won by the Liberal Party. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was heavily criticized for ignoring these warnings.\n\nOn March 30, Chong wrote on his X account that “[a]t least three Canadians have been coerced against their will to return to the People’s Republic of China,” indicating that the bounty touted by Chiang is no joke. Chinese expatriates living in Canada, and other countries, have good reason to fear the long arm of transnational repression from Beijing, especially if they still have families in China.\n\n“Paul Chiang’s support for the CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party’s) illegal and unjust bounty on a Canadian citizen is shocking, particularly to the countless Canadians of Chinese descent who have been targeted and harassed by the Communist regime,” Chong said in a press release on March 29.\n\n“After the lost Liberal decade of turning a blind eye to foreign interference by the CCP, warnings from experts, and a public inquiry, the Liberals continue to tolerate foreign interference putting the security of Canadians at risk,” his statement read.\n\n“Mark Carney’s silence on his candidate creates the dangerous impression that he condones this despicable suggestion,” Chong charged.\n\nOn March 30, Joe Tay seconded the call for Carney to sack Chiang by releasing his own statement.\n\nTay’s press release read in part:\n\nHis threatening public comments were intended to intimidate me, and they must not be tolerated. Further, he made an unsolicited attempt last night to contact me to discuss this matter, and has posted on social media that he offered me an apology. I want to be clear: no apology is sufficient. Threats like these are the tradecraft of the Chinese Communist Party to interfere in Canada. And they are not just aimed at me – they are intended to send a chilling signal to the entire community, in order to force compliance to Beijing’s political goals. This situation has left me fearing for my safety. Even prior to Mr. Chiang’s insidious comments coming to light, I had been in touch with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police regarding my personal protection.\n\nIn response, Chiang shared a statement to social media on March 31 in which he admitted that his comments in January urging anyone to turn Tay in to the CCP for a bounty were “deplorable and a complete lapse of judgment on the seriousness of the matter.”\n\nNot all of the criticism for Chiang came from Conservatives. MP Jenny Kwan of the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP), who has herself been targeted by China, asked on March 30: “In what universe is this normal?”\n\nOn March 31, Carney admitted that Chiang’s actions were “deeply offensive” and “a terrible lapse of judgment” – but refused to dismiss him. “He will continue with his candidacy, going forward, having made those apologies very clearly to the individual, to the community and moving forward to serve.”\n\nContinuing, the Liberal prime minister hailed Chiang as a “person of integrity.” Carney did, however, take the precaution of not appearing in public with Chiang, who ostensibly had “other responsibilities” on that particular morning.\n\nConservative Party leader and prime minister candidate Pierre Poilievre said on March 31 that the scandal had blown up from questions about Chiang into a serious indictment of Carney’s judgement. “This is not about an inappropriate or off-color joke. These comments by this Liberal candidate may well rise to the level of criminal because they called for someone to be turned over to a hostile foreign government on a bounty.”\n\nAlso on March 31, UK-based human rights group Hong Kong Watch wrote a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Michael Duheme urging him to launch an investigation of Chiang.\n\n“It is without question that Mr. Chiang’s comments are an attempt to intimidate Mr. Tay and his supporters and to silence him during an election. It is without question there are implicit threats of violence and an illegitimate reward in the form of a bounty,” the organization stated. “Canada must send a strong signal that these threats are not acceptable, and that means enforcement of the law.”\n\nOver a dozen other Hong Kong-Canadian groups likewise urged Carney to revoke Chiang’s candidacy in a joint statement, dismissing Chiang’s apology as “insincere” and citing several Canadian laws he may have violated.\n\n“Chiang’s remarks exemplify how foreign interference continues to cast a shadow over Hong Kong immigrants’ lives in Canada,” the March 31 statement read.",

        "content": "The heads of Iranian universities issued a statement on Sunday welcoming students deported from America for supporting Hamas, an Iran-backed terrorist organization, or other jihadist movements.\n\n“Iran’s universities, [the statement] said, are ready to accept students who are being expelled by US immigration officials for showing sympathy for the Palestinian cause,” the Iranian state propaganda outlet PressTV reported.\n\nPressTV did not name the universities signing the joint statement but noted that the statement indicated the Iranian jihadist regime would “facilitate” the transfer of students who support Iran’s genocidal anti-Israel positions from American colleges to Iranian ones through its “Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR).” Doing so, if the Iranian regime keeps to this promise, would serve to both attract ideologically aligned talent to the country and to increase support for Tehran on the nation’s campuses, which in the past half decade have become hotbeds of dissident sentiment. The Iranian regime has violently suppressed calls for democracy and an end to support for foreign terrorists on the nation’s campuses.\n\nThe invitation to pro-Hamas students deported from America follows a campaign launched in early March by President Donald Trump to identify violent agitators on American campuses and revoke their student and work visas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested last week that over 300 “lunatics” have had their visas revoked due to participation in pro-terrorism riots and other disruptive behavior.\n\nPressTV described the individuals in question as simply “pro-Palestinian protesters,” noting that the Iranian “academic institutions” in question said in their statement that they “take pride in extending support” to these individuals.\n\n“The acts of global arrogance in suppressing justice-seeking students,” the universities said in their joint statement, “and expelling them from American universities after their peaceful protests against the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime against the oppressed people of Palestine have further unveiled the true nature of those who claim to advocate for human rights.”\n\nThe job of “facilitating” the transfer of the students and, potentially, professors, from American to Iranian universities will fall to the SCCR “in collaboration with the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Medical Sciences,” PressTV noted. The outlet did not clarify if an equivalent process exists for transferring humanities and liberal arts students to Iran.\n\nThe current uproar on the left over the deportation of pro-Hamas students began with the arrest in early March of Mahmoud Khalil, the head of a club at Columbia University known as “Apartheid Divest.” Khalil was reportedly identified as a supporter of the genocidal terrorist organization Hamas and remains in custody at press time.\n\n“All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,” President Trump announced in a publication on his social media outlet, Truth Social, on March 3. “Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS!”\n\nSince the arrest of Khalil, several other students on American campuses have had their visas revoked. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest of foreign exchange student Badar Khan Suri, attending Georgetown University, this month for allegedly “actively spreading Hamas propaganda.”\n\n“Suri has close connections to a known or suspect terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas. The Secretary of State issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri’s activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable under INA section 237(a)(4)(C)(i),” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nShortly thereafter, McLaughlin confirmed the arrest and planned deportation of a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, Rumesya Ozturk.\n\n“DHS + ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,” McLaughlin announced. “A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is commonsense security.”\n\nAccording to Secretary Rubio, at least 300 individuals have had their visa privileges revoked on the grounds of publicly supporting terrorist organizations. Rubio told reporters on March 28 that he personally signs the orders to revoke those visas and that “every day” the Trump administration is working to remove more.\n\n“They’re not protesters; they’re taking over college campuses, they’re harassing fellow students,” Rubio said a day prior during a meeting with the president of Suriname, Chandrikapersad Santokhi. “We let them in our country to study. We gave them a visa because they said, I want to go to your university, I want to get a degree. They didn’t say, I want to go to university and I want to vandalize your library, and I want to chase Jewish students down the street, and I want to wear a mask over my face like if it’s Halloween and terrorize people.”\n\n“We didn’t give them a visa to do any of that,” he added.\n\n“People pay a lot of money to go to these schools. They borrow money to go to these schools, and you can’t even go to class because some lunatic who’s covering their face is running through campus,” he continued, “spraypainting things, harassing people. And they’re in my country as a guest. We want them out. Every one of them I find, we’re going to kick them out.”\n\nThe message this weekend is not the first time that Iran offers entry to students rejected in America for pro-terrorist agitation. In May, Shiraz University announced that it would welcome not just foreign students studying in America, but American students and professors facing disciplinary action for participating in violent campus riots in support of Hamas.\n\n“Students and even professors who have been expelled or threatened with expulsion can continue their studies at Shiraz University and I think that other universities in Shiraz as well as Fars Province are also prepared [to provide the conditions],” the president of the university, Mohammad Moazzeni, announced at the time.\n\nThe “supreme leader” of the Iranian regime, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, himself offered support to the violent pro-Hamas movements on campuses at the time.\n\nThe support for students on American campuses is a dramatic departure from the repressive crackdowns against Iranian students at home, who tend to oppose the regime’s Islamist totalitarianism and support for foreign terror movements over investing in the country. Iran faces near-annual waves of campus protests to which it responds by deploying its violent repressive police. Support for Hamas, in particular, has led to protests demanding Iran stop funneling regime resources to foreign jihadists; in late 2023, following the Hamas massacres in Israel that year, Iranian students reportedly began protesting against their regime by supporting Israel.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

        "content": "British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that illegal immigration should be confronted similarly to the war on terror, as he hosted an international summit on the issue in London.\n\nRepresentatives from over 40 nations, including illegal migrant hot spots such as Albania and Vietnam, descended on London on Monday in what is being dubbed as the largest global gathering to focus on illegal immigration.\n\nHosting, UK PM Sir Keir Starmer said that the international people smuggling trade, estimated to be worth around $10 billion (£7.7bn) per year, must be treated in “much the same way that we do against terrorism” if it is to be stopped.\n\n“Illegal migration is a massive driver of global insecurity. It undermines our ability to control who comes here. And that makes people angry,” Starmer said.\n\n“It makes me angry, frankly, because it is unfair on ordinary working people who pay the price, from the cost of hotels to our public services struggling under the strain,” he continued.\n\n“And it’s unfair on the illegal migrants themselves. Because these are vulnerable people being ruthlessly exploited by vile gangs.”\n\nThe British prime minister urged the international representatives to combine resources and share intelligence to tackle to people smuggling trade “at every step of the people smuggling journey, from North Africa and the Middle East to the high streets of our biggest cities.”\n\nStarmer cited multilateral efforts to bust human trafficking networks, such as a joint effort from Berlin, Paris, and London last year to break up a smuggling operation run by Iraqis.\n\nThe British PM also claimed that there have also been successful multilateral operations carried out in the Netherlands against smuggling networks and campaigns in places like Albania and Vietnam to convince prospective illegals to remain in their homelands.\n\nIn terms of next steps, Starmer said that his government would be devoting £30 million to fund operations targeting the finances and supply chains of networks operating throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe and another £3 million to expand British prosecutorial reach internationally.\n\nThe government is also looking at cracking down on illegal migrants working in the gig economy and on businesses which continue to employ illegals.\n\nIt has also been reported by the Daily Mail that the government is considering challenging some of the premisses of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and their applications in British law, which have been used by illegals to successfully avoid deportations. However, the government has so far refused to withdraw the UK from the convention.\n\nStarmer said that since his government came into power last July, the Home Office has deported 24,000 migrants, which he said was the most in eight years. However, this pales in comparison to the estimated one million illegals living in the country and is lower than the number of boat migrants who entered the UK since Labour came into office.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage remarked: “Over 30,000 migrants have crossed the Channel since Labour came to power. More illegals crossed in the first 3 months of 2025 than the same period in 2024. He promised to smash the gangs, but he’s smashing Rishi Sunak’s record instead.”",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "A Boston judge dismissed a criminal case against a migrant here in the United States illegally, citing prosecutorial misconduct after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained him during his criminal trial. The judge also held the arresting ICE agent in contempt of court for “egregious misconduct.”\n\nWilson Martell-Lebron, a Dominican national, appeared in court last Thursday on charges for having provided false information on a license application, but when he left Boston’s Edward W. Brooke Courthouse, he was detained by ICE agents and placed in an unmarked SUV. Boston Municipal Court Judge Mark Summerville accused the agents of “obstructing justice,” adding that ICE agent Brian Sullivan “conspired in a premeditated manner” to take Martell-Lebron into custody, per Boston 25 News. Summerville even charged that Sullivan “intentionally” and “egregiously” Martell-Lebron’s rights under the 6th and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“I find that this court cannot trust ICE to return the defendant back to court. I don’t find that they’re credible,” Summerville said. “I have no confidence in ICE, no matter what they told the Commonwealth, that they would ever bring this defendant into court.”\n\nSummerville left the matter to the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office on whether the ICE agent would face charges. He also dismissed the case against Martell-Lebron for alleged prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n“We’ll see how serious the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office takes this egregious conduct, and what they do with it, and whether any investigation does go forward, and whether any prosecution goes forward,” Summerville said. “It’s out of my hands now.”\n\n“I believe that this case is necessary to deter this type of misconduct in the future and to deter this type of misconduct from the Commonwealth team, the prosecution team,” Summerville added. “I find that ICE Agent Brian Sullivan was a member of the prosecution team.”\n\nThe DA’s office said that it did not coordinate with ICE and were “dismayed and surprised” by the detainment.\n\n“We have been instrumental to Boston becoming one of the safest cities in the nation by pursuing ethical prosecutions that hold offenders accountable and treat victims with dignity,” the DA’s office said. “We were dismayed and surprised when our prosecution of Wilson Martell-Lebron was interrupted by ICE apprehending him in the middle of our case.”\n\n“Any claim that we were aware of an attempt to prevent Mr. Martell Lebron from exercising his right to a trial is false. It was and still is our intention to try Mr. Martell-Lebron and hold him accountable for the crimes alleged in the complaint,” it added. “Federal authorities should not have detained him and interfered with our efforts to hold him accountable.”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

        "content": "A wild mob was seen smashing windows of NYPD vehicles and jumping on at least one police vehicle in Queens, New York, after law enforcement responded to an apparent car meetup.\n\nA swarm of traffic-cone-wielding hooligans caused significant damage to at least three NYPD vehicles during the early hours of Sunday, according to a report by ABC7 Eyewitness News.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nAdditional video footage shows at least one perpetrator jumping on an NYPD vehicle just before 1:00 a.m. on Rockaway Boulevard in Ozone Park, where police responded to a car meetup that was reported to have gotten out of hand.\n\nAuthorities say the unruly crowd — many of whom were clad in masks — dented the sides of NYPD vehicles and used traffic cones to break their car windows.\n\nWatch Below:\n\nPolice reportedly arrived at the scene to address what they believed was a car meetup where participants had been driving their own vehicles recklessly.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the New York Police Department asked the public for help in identifying the culprits, noting that the suspects were “wanted for reckless endangerment” and “criminal mischief.”\n\n“A group of individuals recklessly operated multiple vehicles and vandalized three NYPD vehicles,” the department said.\n\nSo far, three suspects have been arrested: 23-year-old Jordi Montesquieu of Massachusetts, and 18-year-olds Tyler Newman of New Hampshire, and Tristian Nandram of Queens, according to a report by the New York Post.\n\nMontesquieu was reportedly charged with third-degree criminal mischief, second-degree reckless endangerment, second-degree unlawful fleeing a police car, and obstructing governmental administration, police and other sources told the outlet.\n\nNewman, meanwhile, was slapped with a charge of obstructing governmental administration.\n\nNandram was charged with third-degree criminal mischief, obstructing governmental administration, possession of stolen property and petty larceny. He is also accused of stealing a bag containing police paperwork from the back of an NYPD vehicle, sources said.\n\nNew York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch took to X on Sunday to proclaim that law enforcement will “be back soon” to detain “the rest of them.”\n\n“We will not tolerate lawlessness or vandalism aimed at the police,” Tisch said, adding that “several individuals” had already been arrested “for crimes that endangered our cops and our streets.”\n\n“Rest assured, we’ll be back soon for the rest of them,” the police commissioner asserted.\n\n“It started when NYPD officers were doused with water in broad daylight — and told not to respond. No consequences. That moment marked the start of lawlessness in New York City,” Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa said on Sunday in reaction to the incident.\n\nSliwa, who was the Republican nominee in New York City’s 2021 mayoral election and is running again in the 2025 election, added, “Then came Andrew Cuomo’s 2019 pro-criminal laws — like cashless bail, Less is More, and Raise the Age — along with the repeal of 50-a, which stripped protections from cops.”\n\n“Then, the 2020 riots,” Sliwa continued. “City Council piled on with reckless laws — Brad Lander’s defunding the police, the diaphragm bill, and other anti-cop legislation.”\n\n“Eric Adams made things worse by turning the NYPD into a pay-to-play operation, failing to recruit, and driving seasoned cops out,” the mayoral candidate declared.\n\n“Under Adams, we’ve had endless riots, agitators shutting down streets and bridges — and now masked mobs surrounding police cars and smashing windows,” Sliwa said.\n\n“Our officers are the best in the world, but we must let them do their jobs without fear, hesitation, or political interference,” he added. “We must restore law and order — and a Sliwa Administration will bring back the New York we know and love.”\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

If you look at our trade deficits, we’re about $1.5 trillion in trade deficits. This is — we’ve seen during the pandemic, we have, really, a weakened infrastructure as it regard[s] so many different industries in the United States, manufacturing, boat building, and so many other ones.

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said he urgently wants a deal in Ukraine to save lives, threatening Russia with “secondary tariffs” on its oil trade if President Vladimir Putin doesn’t “fulfil his part of the deal”.\n\nRussia will be hit with “secondary tariffs” — which President Trump defines as monetary sanctions on second nations that buy products from the another to discourage trade — on its oil exports if it doesn’t hurry up and agree to peace in Ukraine, a “very angry” U.S. President has warned in a series of remarks.\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office on Monday night, President Trump explained he wants to see Russia’s Vladimir Putin make a deal because of the value of human life, the U.S. leader reminding the press pack that both Ukrainian and Russian soldiers are human beings.\n\nSaying that pushing for peace is worthwhile to save “2,500 human beings” a week, President Trump said of his Russian counterpart: “I want to make sure that he follows through and I think he will, I don’t want to go secondary tariffs on his oil”.\n\nPresident Trump reminded that secondary tariffs had already been very effective against Venezuela and said he expected the same with Russia, if his hand was forced because: “He knows I don’t play games.”\n\nBecause of this warning, President Trump said he believes Putin will ultimately stop dragging his feet and “fulfil his part of the deal”.\n\nAs previously reported, the threats of ‘tariffs’ against the customers of Russian oil to attack the Russian economy come as part of President Trump’s apparent pivot from carrot to stick for Moscow, having earlier offered concessions and cooperation to get the Kremlin to the negotiating table. He said at the weekend, per NBC that Russia trying to change the direction of travel in negotiations left him feeling “very angry, pissed off” and later on Air Force One that Putin had been “disappointing… I wasn’t happy with that”.\n\nPresident Trump has also been maintaining focus on Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who attempted to re-litigate the minerals deal in front of the press at the White House in February. Responding to claims Ukraine now wants to swap minerals for NATO membership, Trump retorted in the Oval Office that this was “never discussed” and is not on the table.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One, Trump said of that notion: “I think Zelensky, by the way, I see he’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal.\n\n“And if he does that, he’s got some problems. We made a deal on rare earth, and now he’s saying: ‘Well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal.’ He wants to be a member of NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that.”",

        "title": "Michael Bublé Challenges Trump with Patriotic Canada Rant: ‘When They Go Low, We Get High’",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Canadian signer Michael Bublé delivered a patriotic monologue on Sunday in which he declared his country is “not for sale” and “the greatest nation on earth,” an apparent response to President Donald Trump repeatedly suggesting that America could annex Canada.\n\nBublé made the remarks while hosting Canada’s Juno Awards, an annual music event. He did not mention Trump by name or offer any explicit political endorsement or condemnation – notable given that Canada is heading for a general election on April 28 contested mostly between incumbent, unelected Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. Both Poilievre and Carney are campaigning on the claim that Trump would prefer their opponent win the election, attempting to capitalize on growing anti-American sentiment in the country driven in part by Trump’s “51st state” comments. Bublé’s comments were nonetheless interpreted as defiance against the idea of Canada losing its sovereign to its southern neighbor.\n\n“You guys know I’m a hometown kid – I’m a hometown kid who never left,” Bublé told the audience, “and as I stand here and I look out at my fellow artists … I’m proud to be Canadian.”\n\nBublé attempted to reference a line first popularized by American former First Lady Michelle Obama, asserting, “when they go low, we get high,” which he rapidly corrected. The singer never identified the “they” he was challenging, but continued, “when you love something, you show up for it, and we always will.”\n\n“We will, because we’re formidable, because we’re fearless, because we don’t just acknowledge our differences, we embrace them,” Bublé stated. “Because they don’t just make us stronger, they make us a hell of lot more interesting.”\n\n“We are the greatest nation on earth and we are not for sale,” he concluded.\n\nThe current tensions between Washington and Ottawa began shortly after President Trump won his second term in office. At the time, Trump announced a plan to impose a 25-percent tariff on both Canada and Mexico in response to what he described as an out-of-control crime situation on the northern border and Canada’s failure to stop drug and human trafficking hurting Americans.\n\n“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump threatened in November. “This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”\n\nThe prime minister at the time, radical leftist Justin Trudeau, rapidly flew to Florida to discuss the situation with the president-elect. Trump ultimately delayed the tariffs and did not impose them on January 20, but joked that Trudeau was the “governor” of the “state” of Canada, outraging Canadians and eventually dooming Trudeau’s political career. After a decade in power, Trudeau announced in January he would resign, a move largely believed to be fueled by infighting in the Liberal Party over his poor showing with Trump.\n\n“Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned,” Trump wrote on social media shortly after Trudeau announced his plan to resign.\n\nTrump has since resumed conversation with Carney, Trudeau’s successor who took power in March after winning the leadership of the Liberal Party in an internal membership election. Trump and Carney most recently spoke on Friday in a phone call that Trump praised as “extremely productive.”\n\n“We agree on many things, and we will be meeting immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada,” Trump wrote, apparently presuming Carney’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump explicitly stated in an interview with Fox News this month that he would prefer Carney win to the conservative Poilievre.\n\n“I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all,” Trump said.\n\n“The Conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know him, but he said negative things,” Trump said of Poilievre. “So, when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less. I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all.”\n\nDespite Trump’s stated preference for and politeness towards Carney, Canadian leftists have attempted to brand Poilievre as the pro-Trump options. Leftist celebrities, most prominently comedian Mike Myers, have embraced Carney.\n\nBublé has openly discussed politics in past interviews but not embraced any particular partisan identity. He was notably a guest on conservative television personality Glenn Beck’s two programs – on CNN and Fox News – in the 2000s, though he did not offer any overt political commentary. Bublé has been a vocal supporter of gay rights, citing in past interviews members of his family who are gay, and once joked it was “sexist” of him to refer to Santa Claus as “buddy” in his version of the Christmas classic “Santa Baby.”\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Bublé described himself as listening “to people like Richard Dawkins and Noam Chomsky on YouTube.”\n\nIn several public instances, when asked about Trump personally, Bublé has offered neither praise nor explicit condemnation.\n\n“I can’t stop the politicians or stupid, uneducated people from thinking and saying and doing stupid things, but I can make a stand, I can talk to you,” he said in an interview with David magazine, “and when I’m with groups of friends or I’m in public places or when I’m with people who I think can use that sense of love and education, I can open my mouth and tell them how I feel. And one at a time, you can change the world like that.”\n\nIn more recent comments in 2023, Bublé lamented that American media was “very conservative” and the country was experiencing a “great divide.”\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

        "title": "Poll Shows Split as Trump Slams Judges for Pro-Migration Rulings",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Forty-five percent of Americans say federal judges are trying to block President Donald Trump’s election mandate, according to a poll of 1,115 likely voters by Rasmussen Reports.\n\nStill, 60 percent of respondents do not want to ignore federal court injunctions, according to the poll, which took place in late March.\n\nThe results come as Trump’s staff push more lawsuits to the U.S. Supreme Court where they expect the judges will recognize their argument that the Constitution gives the president sweeping power to manage the nation’s borders.\n\n“The fundamental error in how immigration is being discussed in the courts and media is pretending that what happened to us over the last four years is a routine civil enforcement matter,” said a March 29 tweet from Stephen Miller, Trump’s migration deputy. He continued:\n\nNO. We were invaded and occupied. Entire neighborhoods were conquered. Entire towns were subjugated. Our treasury was in the plundered. Our democracy was torn apart piece by piece. A national referendum was held on whether to surrender to the invasion or repel it. America voted for liberation. If every foreign trespasser gets to have their own federal trial prior to removal then there is no liberation. There is no restoration. The invasion will be made complete. Article 4 Section 4 requires the president to halt any invasion and no district court can override that mandate. For the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. The invading armies and foreign trespassers will be expelled. The cartels will be smashed. Liberation will be achieved.\n\nMore than 14 judges and courts have blocked Trump’s deportation programs. For example, a judge ruled last week that migrants must be allowed to appeal their deportations to countries other than their home country. This legal claim, if approved, would make it difficult for the president to deport economic or criminal migrants when the home country governments do not want them back.\n\nPro-migration advocates defend the multiplying legal roadblocks to the deportation of roughly 9 million inadmissible migrants that Biden’s deputies deliberately imported, usually without protest by judges and lawyers.\n\n“The Trump administration has used its first few months to target the due process rights of immigrants,” said an op-ed by David Leopold, an immigration lawyer and the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “If left unchecked, its efforts will threaten the broader rights and liberties of us all.”\n\nThe Rasmussen poll asked, “Several federal district court judges have issued injunctions to block President Donald Trump’s policies. Which is closer to your opinion?”\n\nForty-nine percent said, “Trump’s policies violate the Constitution,” and 45 percent said, “District court judges are wrongfully interfering with the president’s exercise of his constitutional powers.” But there is room for Trump to make up ground because self-described moderates split 56 percent to 34 percent.\n\nThe poll asked, “Should President Trump just ignore federal court injunctions he believes are unconstitutional?” Just 27 percent said yes, including just 41 percent of Republicans. Sixty percent said no, including 67 percent of moderates.\n\nFifty-seven percent of likely voters said the “current conflict between Trump and federal judges [is] a constitutional crisis.” Just 28 percent said no.\n\nThe poll shows Americans are zigzagging between their desire for constitutional order and their desire to deport Biden’s migrants.\n\nAbout 58 percent of American adults told CBS pollsters they approve of Trump’s program to “find and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally,” while 42 percent said they disapprove.\n\nThe March poll of 2,609 adults also showed that 56 percent of swing voters support Trump’s deportation program, as do 93 percent of Republicans. Majorities of white non-college-educated Americans, 69 percent, and white college-educated Americans, 56 percent, support the deportations.",

These are the folks who know where the efficiencies can be made.”\n\nHost José Díaz-Balart asked, “I’m just wondering, where do you draw the line in efficiency, in if there [are] exaggerated costs or abuse of some things? Where do you draw the line on finding that abuse, finding inefficiencies, and, yet, not affecting the people that so desperately count on that help?”\n\nClarke responded, “Well, I would say that it’s important that we go in with a scalpel and not a chainsaw, right? I would say that you don’t fire the workforce if you’re trying to find efficiencies. These are the folks who know where the efficiencies can be made.”\n\nShe continued, “At the end of the day, we have an obligation, as Americans, to take care of one another. And that means that, what some people call entitlements, others refer to and I believe are earned benefits. You earn, in your employment, Social Security benefits, you earn, in your employment, health care and Medicare. So, for these individuals to target these earned benefits is a huge departure from the compact that we’ve had with Americans for generations now.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

Security Council (UNSC) conference on “multilateralism.”\n\nHe is on a three-day visit to the Russian capital where he is expected to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, as well as Vladimir Putin.\n\nDays before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, China and Russia declared a “no limits” strategic partnership, though Beijing has insisted it remains neutral in the conflict.\n\nAddressing the prospect of peace, Wang said there must be a “fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved.”\n\nHe praised the normalisation of ties between Russia and the U.S., dismissing the idea that Donald Trump was trying to support Moscow in order to disrupt its relations with Beijing.\n\nThe Reuters report notes Chinese President Xi Jinping has met Putin over 40 times in the past decade and the two leaders have since agreed to deepen ties and cooperate on issues such as Taiwan, Ukraine and mutual rival the United States.",

        "content": "Liberal Party of Canada leader Mark Carney, who became prime minister upon Justin Trudeau’s resignation two weeks ago and will run as his party’s candidate in the April 28 snap election, has been accused of plagiarism in his 1995 thesis for a doctorate in economics from Oxford University.\n\nThe National Post on Friday pointed to ten clear examples of Carney using “full quotes, paraphrases, or slightly modified quotes from four previous works” in his 1995 thesis without “proper acknowledgement or attribution.”\n\nThe National Post printed the allegedly plagiarized passages from Carney’s thesis in their entirety, along with word-for-word quotes from the original material, and in each of the cited cases they were nearly identical.\n\nThe article ominously noted that “social status hasn’t stopped universities from revoking degrees” when infractions such as plagiarism were uncovered later.\n\n“Many European ministers have had to resign following allegations that some of their university work was plagiarized or after having been stripped of some of their academic credentials,” the National Post recalled.\n\nThe Liberal Party was enraged by the National Post story, although it struggled to refute any of the allegations, and evidently could not dispute the accuracy of the ten instances highlighted by the paper. Instead, the campaign brought forth its own expert — Carney’s doctoral supervisor at the time his thesis was written, Dr. Margaret Meyer — to assert that nothing in the thesis rose to the level of actionable plagiarism.\n\nMeyer told the National Post it was “mischaracterizing” the work, which she said included no “unusual academic practices.”\n\n“When pieces are frequently referenced in an academic text, it is typical that overlapping language appears,” Meyer wrote.\n\n“Mark’s thesis was evaluated and approved by a faculty committee that saw his work for what it is: an impressive and thoroughly researched analysis that set him apart from his peers,” she concluded.\n\nThe Liberal Party sneeringly dismissed the National Post as an “American-owned” publication and accused it of ignoring exculpatory evidence to condemn Carney “based on the ‘analysis’ of a Conservative donor and activist.”\n\nThe National Post marched out its own experts, one of whom was an Oxford graduate who preferred to remain anonymous “out of fear of being sued by Carney” to argue that Carney’s thesis absolutely does meet Oxford’s publishing standards for plagiarism in numerous passages.\n\n“When you have something lifted verbatim from a source, in there without quotation marks or citation… that constitutes plagiarism,” the anonymous professor contended.\n\n“He’s just directly repeating without quotations. That’s what we call plagiarism,” said the analyst quoted in the National Post article, Geoffrey Sigalet, an assistant professor and member of the University of British Columbia’s (UBC) advisory committee on student discipline.\n\nSigalet said some of the examples of potential plagiarism cited in Carney’s thesis were clear, while others fell into a “grey area” under UBC’s standards known as “patchworking” — a somewhat careless practice in which citations are not provided in close proximity to quoted material, but are included elsewhere in the text.\n\nSigalet went on to observe that Oxford’s standards for such practices are considerably tighter, so Oxford would normally have censured Carney for minor infractions that UBC might have ignored.\n\nThe National Post pointed out that Sigalet’s duties include policing student submissions for plagiarism, so he would seem to be an informed analyst. He is presumably the expert the Liberal Party thought should be ignored because he is a “conservative donor and activist.” The Liberal Party did not care to divulge Meyer’s political contributions, or state whether her opinions should be ignored on the basis of partisan activity.\n\nSome commenters noted that Meyer has an implicit conflict of interest beyond political considerations, since it would be embarrassing for her to concede that she approved Carney’s paper while ignoring multiple instances of plagiarism under Oxford’s standards.\n\nThe Conservative Party seems thus far content to let the plagiarism story simmer in its own juices, although Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre did share a link to the National Post story on Friday morning, without adding comments of his own.",

        "content": "A judge is barring President Donald Trump from ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) amnesty given to 530,000 Venezuelans — including Tren de Aragua gangsters — by President Joe Biden’s deputies.\n\nA California-based U.S. District Court Judge, Edward Chen, cited the migrants’ economic activity as if that entitled them to legal status regardless of U.S. laws and politics, claiming:\n\n[They] have have higher educational attrainment that most U.S. citizens (40-54%) have bachelors degrees), have higher labor participation rates (80-96%) [because they are younger, on average] … and annually contribute billions of dollars to the U.S. economy and pay hundreds of millions, if not billions, in Social Security taxes.\n\nThe California-born judge was nominated by President Barack Obama.\n\n“This is what we mean by judicial tyranny,” responded Stephen Miller, Trump’s policy chief, adding:\n\nBiden mass imported illegals from Venezuela, including criminals, gave them welfare and social security numbers. President Trump won an election promising to end the invasion. A rogue marxist judge just ordered Biden’s amnesty continued.\n\nThe judge blocked Trump’s plan to start ending the TPS status next month by arguing that the enforcement of Americans’ laws would be bad for the illegal migrants:\n\n[The court] finds that the Secretary’s actions threaten to inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted. Cost the United States billions in economic activity and injures public health and safety in communities throughout the United States. At the same time, the government failed to identify any real countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries. Plaintiffs have also shown they will likely succeed in demonstrating that the actions taken by the Secretary [Kristi Noem] are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus. For these reasons, the court grants plaintiffs’ request to postpone the actions pending the filing of adjudication merits of this case.\n\nIn reality, that mass inflow of 530,000 migrants into the United States has pushed down wages for American families and also pushed up their housing costs. One result is greater economic pressure against the creation of new families and the birth of American children.\n\nSome of the Venezuelan migrants have preyed on murdered Americans — for example, Laken Riley — and the continuing stay of the migrants will inflict additional crimes on ordinary Americans.\n\nRELATED: Texas Troopers Remove Venezuelan Flag Planted by Migrants on Border River Island\n\nThe 530,000 include some members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang that have been implicated in many crimes around the nation, including the takeover of at least one apartment building in Aurora, Colorado.\n\n“The judge is completely disregarding the law … this is a judge who wants to be president rather than judge, responded John Miano, a lawyer who specializes in migration cases.\n\nThe TPS law says:\n\nThere is no judicial review of any determination of the Attorney General with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this subsection.\n\nThe rogue judge should be constrained by directives from senior judges at the circuit courts, the appeals courts, and the U.S. Supreme Court, Miano said. Their jobs include the management of the nation’s lower judges, he said, adding:\n\nThey don’t want to do it because they all want to preserve that [unconstrained legal] power for themselves. [So] the circuit courts don’t want to be slapping down [lower] judges because they don’t want to be slapped down by the [higher] Supreme Court.\n\n“They don’t manage [lower judges], and this is why we have chaos in the courts,” Miano added.\n\nThe case is National TPS Alliance v. Kristi Noem, Case No. 25-cv-01766-EMC. in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California.",

        "content": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court race has become the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history, as conservatives face the chance to take back the 4-3 liberal majority, and Democrats view the battle as a chance to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats.\n\nThe April 1 election is between Trump-backed Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge and former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel and Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford who previously represented left-wing groups like Planned Parenthood as an attorney and is endorsed by groups like the pro-abortion EMILY’s list. The candidates are making their final pitches on Monday ahead of the election and after the end of early voting on Sunday.\n\nThe race is expected to reach $100 million, which practically doubles the previous record spent on a judicial contest held by the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court election. To date, more than $90 million has been spent on the race, the Associated Press reported, citing the Brennan Center.\n\n“For perspective, about $100 million was spent on 68 supreme court elections across 26 states in 2021 and 2022 combined, according to a Brennan Center tally,” the report states.\n\nREAD MORE: Exclusive — Eyes on Wisconsin: State Supreme Court Race That Could Bring Trump’s Agenda to a Screeching Halt\n\n“I think this will be important for the future of civilization,” Elon Musk said of the election at a rally for Schimel in Green Bay on Sunday. “It’s that’s significant.”\n\nWhile judicial races are nonpartisan, both sides of the political aisle are heavily invested in the results of the election. Wisconsin justices serve ten-year terms, and another chance to change the court will not arise until 2028.\n\nDemocrats’ view of the race as a pathway to power in D.C. is not mere speculation and has been touted openly. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan. 13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler has a subject line that reads: “Chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.” Notably, aides of tech billionaire Reid Hoffman helped to organize the event, the New York Times reported. Hoffman, allegedly a past visitor to Epstein Island, later contributed to the race, along with other left-wing billionaires.\n\n“But winning this race could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026,” the email reads.\n\nThe two seats are currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin and Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) in the 3rd Congressional District in the western part of the battleground state.\n\n“They got caught saying the quiet thing out loud, and they revealed what they’re up to. This is, as it was in 2023, a power play to attract enormous amounts of money from partisan donors and turn that into results on the court,” Schimel told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview, referring to the email. Breitbart News previously reached out to Crawford’s campaign for comment but did not receive a response, although the candidate has denied wrongdoing in statements to other outlets\n\n“When people talk about the timeline that President Trump has to push his goals, that timeline will be cut short or even shorter if they use the Wisconsin Supreme Court to gerrymander the maps as a court and change our representation in the House of Representatives,” Schimel added.\n\nOn the state level, the court will have the opportunity to rule on highly consequential issues like abortion, election integrity, and unions.\n\nREAD MORE: Exclusive — Trump-Backed Wisconsin Supreme Court Candidate Brad Schimel Talks Saving State from Activist Court\n\nOverall, Crawford raised more than $26 million and Schimel raised $14 million, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nRecords cited in the report show that more than 100,000 people from all 50 states sent money to both campaigns.\n\nA Journal Sentinel review of campaign reports found that 77 percent of Crawford’s donors come from outside of Wisconsin compared to only 15 percent of Schimel’s donors.\n\n“This is crazy that people from California are going to decide who’s on our Wisconsin Supreme Court. That’s wrong. I’m running for the people of Wisconsin and well over four-fifths of my money and donors come from people who vote right here in Wisconsin. We’ve got to make sure we turn that into votes on April 1st,” Schimel said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday.\n\nHowever, both candidates drew most of their actual cash from Wisconsinites, the report found, adding that two-thirds of Crawford’s funds came from state residents, compared to 94 percent for Schimel.\n\nCrawford’s campaign has drawn the support of left-wing billionaires like George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and J.B. Pritzker — individuals known for lavishing millions of dollars on radical causes, like defunding police and transgenderism.\n\nSchimel has received the endorsement of kingmaker President Donald Trump, as well as Trump’s top advisor, Tesla CEO and head of DOGE Elon Musk. Musk and two groups he backs have spent more than $21 million on the race, according to an assessment by Brennan Center for Justice. A breakdown by the Journal Sentinel found that $3 million went to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, while the rest went to America PAC and Building America’s Future.\n\nDemocrats have pounced on Musk’s involvement in the race as a talking point, painting the election not only as a referendum on abortion, but a chance to refute the so-called Trump/Musk agenda.\n\nRELATED: Wisconsin Supreme Court Rejects Hearing Democrat AG’s Lawsuit to Stop Elon Musk from Giving $1M Payments\n\nThere seems to be a great flush of voter enthusiasm for the spring election. According to AP, through the last day of early voting on Sunday, 644,800 people had cast ballots, which is 57 percent higher than early voting numbers in the battleground state’s 2023 Supreme Court election.\n\nBoth majority Democrat and Republican counties have seen massive increases in early voting. Milwaukee County, which is the state’s largest county and heavily Democrat, has seen a 40 percent early voting increase compared to 2023. Dane County, which is also liberal and the second largest county in the state, has seen a 43 percent increase, according to the report.\n\nThree suburban Milwaukee counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, all of which lean red, have seen massive increases in ballot returns as well. Early voting is up 62 percent in Waukesha County, 53 percent in Ozaukee County, and it is nearly double what it was in 2023 in Washington County, the report details.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

She is the handpicked voice of the Leftists who are out to destroy your State, and our Country — And if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin. All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel.\n\nDuring an interview with Breitbart News Saturday, Schimel expressed that ever since the liberals “took over” the state’s Supreme Court, “they have been going through a political agenda.”\n\n“Two years ago, the liberals took over our Wisconsin Supreme Court,” Schimel explained. “They got the majority on the court, and since they did, they have been going through a political agenda. They are striking down all of the laws they don’t agree with. They’re just checking off this list of all these things on their wishlist.”",

        "content": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the Democrats’ attempted takedown of President Donald Trump over Signal-gate “failed utterly” after a new CBS News poll revealed that his approval rating did not suffer after the incident.\n\nOn Monday’s episode of “Verdict,” the senator’s podcast he co-hosts with radio personality Ben Ferguson, Cruz said the left-wing media wants to use the Signal messages leaked by the Atlantic to “destroy” Trump:\n\nThe Left is not subtle. The Democrats in the media, they tell you exactly what they’re doing, and they’re all monolithic because they believe in censorship. They believe in propaganda. Every one of them says exactly the same thing, 100 percent of the time. And listen, it’s clear they hate Donald Trump. They want to destroy him. They hate everything he’s doing. And they looked at this Signal text thread as their big chance. This was going to be their “Russia, Russia, Russia,” that they were going to use to go after the President, to go after every one of his appointees.\n\nThe Signal-gate incident was first reported last week by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who shared screenshots from an encrypted group chat full of senior Trump administration officials that he appeared to have been mistakenly added to by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nMessages from the chat, which also included Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and others, revealed discussion about the U.S. military attacks on Houthis two days before they were carried out.\n\n“It was a pretty embarrassing mistake,” Cruz acknowledged. “But the underlying substance of the text exchange was great. It was actually the President and the national security team taking out terrorists who were attacking Americans, who had been attacking American shipping lanes, who Biden had ignored and done nothing, and who had been driving up costs for American consumers because it was so expensive to get through the Suez Canal.”\n\nCBS’s latest poll revealed that the leak of the Signal messages do “not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall,” as he garnered a 50-percent approval rating:\n\nCruz said, “Well, on Sunday, CBS released a new poll, and it turns out their entire attack on Signalgate failed.”\n\n“The CBS poll shows 50 percent of Americans approve of Donald Trump, 50 percent disapprove. In other words, their entire effort to take him down failed utterly,” the Texas Republican asserted.",

Once again, we extend our gratitude to Nayib Bukele and the government of El Salvador for their unparalleled partnership in making our countries safe against transnational crime and terrorism.”\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele confirmed the deportation flight, seemingly expressing gratitude to Trump and Rubio for their “fight against terrorism and organized crime.”\n\n“Last night, in a joint military operation with our allies from the United States, we transferred 17 extremely dangerous criminals linked to Tren de Aragua and MS-13. All individuals are confirmed murderers and high-profile offenders, including six child rapists,” Bukele wrote on X.\n\nThe deportation comes after the Trump administration deported nearly 300 Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members earlier this month to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nLeft-wing groups, including one linked to the Soros network, sued to halt the deportations and Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order to do just that. Last week, an appellate court upheld Boasberg’s ability to block Trump from deporting gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to fully vacate Boasberg’s decision and issue an immediate administrative stay on his order so the deportation flights can continue.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

        "content": "Keith Siegel — an American hostage held by Hamas for more than 16 months, speaking publicly in detail for the first time — described shocking abuse in captivity, saying he lived in constant fear and personally witnessed female hostages being tortured and sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists.\n\nIn an emotional interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday, the 65-year-old, originally from North Carolina — who was kidnapped by Hamas during its brutal October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and held in Gaza for 484 days — described the abuse, starvation, and psychological torment he endured in captivity.\n\nOn October 7, Siegel and his wife, Aviva, were taken from their home and dragged into Gaza in their own car, where they were held underground in Hamas-dug tunnels.\n\n“We were gasping for our breath,” he recalled.\n\nAviva was released during a temporary ceasefire in late November 2023, but Keith remained in captivity for nearly three more months.\n\nIn the harrowing televised account, Siegel — known as a gentle, devoted man, deeply committed to his wife, children, and grandchildren — recounted the inhumane treatment he endured as well as what he was forced to witness.\n\n“I witnessed a young woman who was being tortured by the terrorist,” he told CBS. “I mean literal torture — not just in a figurative sense.”\n\nHe said he saw female hostages being sexually assaulted, an allegation that echoes growing evidence of systematic abuse carried out by Hamas during its attacks on and captivity of civilians.\n\nHe also noted his treatment worsened sharply after the first ceasefire and hostage deal ended in November 2023.\n\n“The terrorists became very mean and very cruel and violent. Much more so,” Siegel said. “They were beating me and starving me.”\n\nHe described being taunted while captors ate in front of him and refused to share food. Furthermore, basic hygiene was nonexistent, with hostages allowed to “shower” once a month with only a cold bucket of water and a small cup.\n\nSiegel, who was seen weeping during the interview, also revealed his captors shaved his head and genitals, saying it seemed to “amuse” them. “I felt humiliated,” he stated.\n\nAs time wore on, Siegel’s psychological condition deteriorated.\n\n“I felt that I was completely dependent on the terrorists,” he said. “That my life relied on them — whether they were going to give me food, bring me water, protect me from the mobs that would lynch me.”\n\nIn what he suspects was a tactic to further torment him, he was sometimes left completely alone in a tunnel.\n\n“I was very, very scared,” he recalled. “Maybe that was a way for them to torture me in a psychological way — make me think, ‘Should I escape?’… But I’m pretty sure they knew I wouldn’t dare.”\n\nEven after being released in February, Siegel remains haunted over the hostages left behind. At least 24 are believed to still be alive in Gaza — including Americans.\n\nThe interview marks one of the most detailed firsthand accounts yet of the brutal and degrading conditions in which Hamas holds its captives. It reinforces long-standing concerns about the terrorist group’s tactics — not only on the battlefield, but in its treatment of civilians.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hamas group, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States government, has long targeted Israeli civilians and is responsible for the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nLast month, Siegel released a video thanking President Donald Trump and urging him to bring other hostages home.\n\n“President Trump, you are the reason I am home alive,” he said, in a video released by the Hostages and Families Forum organization. “You are the reason I was reunited with my beloved wife, four children, and five grandchildren.”",

        "content": "An illegal alien truck driver convicted of “careless driving resulting in death” for his responsibility in a fatal crash in Colorado last summer was detained by ICE Sunday immediately upon his release from jail.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seized Mexican national Ignacio Cruz-Mendoza moments after his release from a Colorado county jail following a roughly one-year prison sentence, KMGH-TV reported.\n\n“If we weren’t here, this person would have been released back to the community of Denver,” Robert Guadian, Denver ICE field director, said.\n\nThis is not the first time that Cruz-Mendoza has been set for deportation. ICE said it had removed the illegal alien from the country twelve times since 2002. It added that the Mexican national had even self-deported four times within the same time period.\n\nGuadian said that ICE should not have had to allocate a handful of agents to take Cruz-Mendoza into custody on Sunday. He explained that the booking could have been more seamlessly arranged had local law enforcement policies not prohibited federal agents from transporting inmates to ICE custody inside detention facilities.\n\n“We’d rather be in the jail. Making a safe and secure transfer of custody takes people off the line, takes agents and officers off the line that … could be doing other things, enforcement activities. Instead, we have to wait in parking lots,” the ICE chief said.\n\nCruz-Mendoza served time for his role in a deadly traffic incident in June 2024 near Conifer, Colorado, in which a semi-truck driven by the illegal alien “veered out of control and dumped a load of steel and iron rods across Highway 285,” the New York Post reported at the time. The metal load landed on the pickup truck of Scott Miller, 64, tragically crushing and killing him. The errant load likewise crushed four other vehicles and caused another driver to suffer major wounds.\n\nThe Jefferson County District Attorney charged Cruz-Mendoza, 47, with “minor traffic misdemeanors — careless driving resulting in a death, and careless driving resulting in injury,” according to the Post. Speaking with the newspaper at the time, Miller’s widow expressed her outrage at the “uncharacteristically low [charges] for such a deadly incident.”\n\nForeign truck drivers have flooded U.S. highways in recent years. Companies have sought to hire them as a cheap labor replacement for U.S. drivers because illegal aliens accept far lower wages than their American counterparts.\n\nLast month, Shannon Everett, a cofounder of American Truckers United, blasted the trucking industry as fatalities on U.S. roads mount, many at the hands of truck drivers who are not citizens.\n\n“We’re trying to make a statement so that the feds will do something. The foreign truck drivers — including many illegals — are killing American drivers, slashing truckers’ income, and pushing companies out of business,” Everett said after an accident involving an illegal driver killed five people in Texas.\n\nOther truckers agree.\n\n“For us, the biggest problem is …. illegal immigrants coming in and getting the license without anything,” said Rhaman Dhillon, the founder of the California-based North American Punjabi Truckers Association. “No training, no language [test], no nothing. They still get it,” he told Breitbart News.\n\nAmerican truck drivers are working hard to lobby state and federal agencies to strengthen regulations and testing requirements to head off the danger on U.S. roads.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.",

Trouble had been brewing for a while.\n\nHooters had sponsored the No. 9 NASCAR car driven by Chase Elliott since 2017, but last year, Hendrick Motorsports ended its ties to the longtime sponsor because it was not meeting its financial commitments.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Hooters closed dozens of locations last summer as inflation continued choking customers and companies in then-President Joe Biden’s America.\n\n“Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision,” a Hooters spokesperson told New York Post at the time, referring to the shut down some of the company’s restaurants.\n\nApproximately 40 of its 300 Hooters restaurants across the globe had been shuttered at the time.",

After gathering evidence for two days, authorities charged the suspect in her death, the Fox article said.\n\nAn arrest warrant said the suspect assaulted the victim by placing her in a chokehold until she lost consciousness. At that point, Rivas reportedly told officers he put his knees and full body weight on her neck which killed her.\n\n“A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that Rivas-Sagastume entered the country illegally from Honduras on March 17, 2021 and was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol. He was later ordered to be removed from the country on July 11, 2023,” The WSB-TV article said, adding that “ICE says they have lodged an immigration detainer with the Cobb County Jail to ensure he remains in custody for removal proceedings.”\n\nAtlanta News First reported on March 21 that the suspect had been living with two other illegal aliens who were also arrested:\n\nIn a social media post on March 22, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) addressed the tragic loss and called for the suspect to face the death penalty.\n\n“In Georgia, we are mourning the tragic and completely avoidable murder of another Georgia woman because of Democrat’s open border and cartel first policies!!! Camillia Williams, a mother of five and grandmother, was brutally murdered by an illegal monster!! Deportation is not enough, GIVE HIM THE DEATH PENALTY!!!!!” she wrote:\n\nThe Angel Family of Williams said she would be alive today if it were not for former President Joe Biden’s (D) disastrous border policies, Breitbart News reported on Thursday.\n\nThe article said that after the suspect was arrested by Border Patrol, “He was subsequently given a Notice to Appear (NTA) before a federal immigration judge and released into the United States interior as part of Biden’s parole pipeline. By July 2023, a judge ordered him deported from the U.S., but he was never taken into ICE custody.”\n\nWilliams’ niece said, “I feel like this could have been avoided had this man been deported when he was caught the first time. Now, he killed my aunt. There’s no telling what else this man has done.”\n\nThe tragedy happened as President Donald Trump’s administration is working to arrest criminal illegals across the nation.",

Paramedics attempted to resuscitate the boxer before taking him to the hospital, and he was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later.\n\nThe boxing authority said it \"is seriously mourning the demise of a potential world beater who was dictating a beautiful fight and all of a sudden ... fell into what has been described as an induced coma even though an official cause of death is yet to be made available after autopsy.\"\n\nOluwasegun had been declared \"medically fit\" for the fight by the Nigeria Boxing Board Control before the Ghana Boxing Authority cleared him to participate, according to the Ghanaian organization.\n\nThe boxer's official record prior to Saturday included 23 fights, with 13 victories and eight defeats. He was a former national and West African champion in his weight class, BBC Sport reported.\n\nRemi Aboderin, the general secretary of the Nigeria Boxing Board Control, described Oluwasegun as \"fearless\" and a \"ring warrior\" in comments to BBC Sport Africa.\n\n\"We are really devastated,\" Aboderin said. \"[This] is not something we envisaged.

        "content": "Beirut, Lebanon — Israel has launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time since a fragile ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November. Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area that Israel's military had warned it would strike.\n\nThe strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.\n\nA man reacts at the site of an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut, Lebanon, March 28, 2025. AFP/Getty\n\nHezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.\n\nLebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.\n\nIt was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.\n\nA map shows Israel and the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, and Israel's borders with neighboring nations Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (not labelled) to the southwest. Getty/iStockphoto\n\nIsraeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.\n\nLast week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.\n\nThe United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.\n\nThe Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"\n\nSmoke billows over Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike, as seen from Baabda, Lebanon, March 28, 2025. Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS\n\nAoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.\n\nIsrael continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens\n\nThe escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.\n\nIsrael has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza — 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.\n\nHamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.\n\nAlmost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city. The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that 855 people had been killed since the resumption of Israeli attacks on March 18. The Hamas-run ministry's figures do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen charity said in a social media post that one of its volunteers in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike Thursday that hit near one of its kitchens during a meal distribution.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy today,\" the organization, founded by American-Spanish chef José Andrés, said in a social media post, adding that six other people were wounded in the same strike. About a year ago, Andrés accused Israeli forces of \"targeting us in a deconflicting zone\" in Gaza. The charity acknowledged dismissing some staff in Gaza in December after Israeli authorities provided a list of about 60 WCK volunteers whom it alleged were linked to terrorism.\n\n\"This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,\" the Washington D.C-based charity said at the time. \"Prior to receiving the results of the COGAT [Israeli government] security check, we had no reason for concern regarding any of these individuals and, because Israel does not share intelligence with aid organizations, we do not know the basis for Israel's decision to flag these individuals. However, we felt this step was necessary to protect our team and operations.\"\n\nThe United Nations' World Food Program also sounded alarm Friday over the deepening hunger crisis in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel cut off the flow of most humanitarian aid into the territory, with its director in the region telling the Al Jazeera network that more than 90% of the enclave's population lacked food security.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israel obstructed 82% of aid convoys intended for Gaza between March 18 and March 24), hampering relief efforts.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nBefore you pursue tax forgiveness with the IRS, it's important to ask the right questions about the rules, the requirements and the alternatives. Getty Images\n\nHitting the submit button on your tax filings can result in a range of emotions, from the relief of getting things squared away to the stress of realizing you owe more than expected to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If you find yourself in the latter situation and are staring down a tax bill that you simply can't pay out of pocket, you may be wondering whether the IRS offers any form of tax forgiveness.\n\nThe good news? They do. The bad news? While the IRS' tax forgiveness programs can help taxpayers reduce or manage their tax debt, qualifying and applying for these options is typically a complex process.\n\nNavigating the IRS' tax forgiveness programs typically requires an understanding of the eligibility criteria, repayment terms and potential alternatives — information that the average taxpayer may not know. So, to get a clear picture of where you stand and how to best navigate your tax debt, it's important to ask the right questions about the IRS tax forgiveness process.\n\nGet extra help with your tax debt today.\n\nIRS tax forgiveness questions to ask now\n\nAsking the IRS tax forgiveness questions outlined below could help you determine if relief is available for you and how you can take advantage of it.\n\nWhat tax forgiveness programs does the IRS offer?\n\nThe IRS offers several programs designed to assist taxpayers who are struggling with their tax debt. The most well-known option is the Offer in Compromise (OIC), which allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed. Other options include installment agreements and penalty abatement. Understanding these programs can help you determine which one best fits your financial situation.\n\nSpeak to a tax relief specialist about your options now.\n\nDo I qualify for an Offer in Compromise?\n\nAn Offer in Compromise is one of the most sought-after forms of tax relief, as it can result in paying a fraction of what you owe to the IRS to settle your tax bill, but not everyone qualifies. The IRS considers your income, expenses, asset equity and ability to pay when evaluating your application. If you're experiencing financial hardship and cannot reasonably pay your full tax debt, this may be an option. However, the application process is rigorous, and the IRS typically rejects applications that don't meet their strict criteria.\n\nCan I set up a payment plan instead?\n\nIf an Offer in Compromise is not an option, an installment agreement may be the next best option. The IRS allows taxpayers to pay off their debt over time through structured monthly payments. But before signing up for a payment plan, you should ask how much interest and penalties will accrue over time, whether you qualify for a short-term or long-term plan and whether an automatic bank withdrawal is required.\n\nHow does Currently Not Collectible status work?\n\nIf you are in extreme financial hardship and cannot afford to make payments at all, you may qualify for Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status. This status temporarily suspends IRS collection efforts, meaning they won't levy your bank accounts or garnish your wages. However, CNC status doesn't forgive or erase your tax debt — it simply defers it until your financial situation improves. So, you should ask how long CNC status lasts and what circumstances could trigger a reassessment.\n\nCan I get my tax penalties forgiven?\n\nTax penalties can quickly add up, making your overall debt even harder to manage. The IRS does offer penalty abatement (meaning that the agency will forgive your tax penalties) in certain circumstances, though, such as first-time offenses or reasonable causes (like medical emergencies and natural disasters). If you're struggling due to penalties, ask whether you qualify for relief and what documentation is required to support your request.\n\nShould I work with a tax relief specialist on tax forgiveness?\n\nWhen dealing with the complexities that come with IRS tax forgiveness programs, you may wonder if professional help is worth the cost. Tax relief specialists understand the nuances of IRS procedures and can often navigate the system more efficiently than individual taxpayers, so for many people, they may be worth the extra money.\n\nIf you decide to work with a specialist, though, be sure to verify their credentials, ask about their success rate with cases similar to yours and get a clear understanding of their fee structure upfront. For simpler cases, you might handle the process yourself, but for complex situations involving substantial tax debt, professional guidance could potentially save you money.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nNavigating IRS tax forgiveness programs typically requires asking the right questions — and you should do so early and often.

Especially at the local watering holes.\n\n\"My husband works at Holiday, and everybody kept coming in to tell him about the eagles,\" said Lynn Wehnert.\n\nThat curiosity caused people to flock to Meuwissen Lake. It's where dozens of bald eagles suddenly appeared last week, allowing both professional and amateur photographers to get up close and personal with the raptors.\n\n\"There were people out there with good cameras getting, I assume, great pictures,\" said Wehnert.\n\nWildlife experts said there are a number of reasons the eagles would come to a little lake in Cologne. They include breeding, nesting, establishing territory, but the most likely reason is to hunt for food.\n\n\"As soon as the ice left, the skies were full of eagles,\" said Richard Arnst, from Benton Lake Watershed Conservancy.\n\nArnst believes crappies and sunfish are why the eagles picked Meuwissen Lake this year.\n\n\"We stocked for the last three years but we've got to believe winterkill this year. The timing was right, the weather was right and the eagles were hungry,\" said Arnst.\n\nThe fish likely flowed from Benton Lake into Lake Meuwissen, making for an easy lunch. Arnst says his organization has also removed about 10,000 carp and bullheads from the lakes to help with water clarity.\n\n\"It was awesome. It was great. It was quite the topic in the bars and everybody's been talking about it,\" said Arnst. \"This is like going to Wabasha for the Eagle Center. We had it here in Cologne.\"\n\nArnst said they plan to keep stocking fish in the future, in the hope that the birds will come back.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said eagle numbers are the healthiest they've been in years.",

        "content": "Stocks skidded Tuesday morning as Wall Street braces for President Trump's rollout of a fresh round of tariffs on April 2, with some economists warning that the new import duties could crimp economic growth and reignite inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 20 points, or 0.4%, to 5,591, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also shed 0.4%.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump hasn't yet disclosed details about his April 2 tariff plans, the president has said he plans to announce so-called reciprocal tariffs, which are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers. But because the cost of tariffs are largely passed onto consumers, they could cause inflation to re-accelerate while dampening economic growth, economists say.\n\n\"We are seeing the early signs of a stagflationary environment emerging, driven not by external shocks but by deliberate policy. That combination is a toxic one for equities,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management company deVere Group in an email.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are likely to experience \"rolling price increases for several quarters\" due to Mr. Trump's tariffs, noted Ed Yardeni, an economist with Yardeni Research, in an April 1 research note. Other nations could impose their own retaliatory tariffs in response to Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement, compounding potential price increases, he noted.\n\n\"And of course, inflation remains elevated above the Fed's 2% target, and the pandemic price shock is still fresh in Americans' minds,\" he added.\n\nTuesday's stock slump comes a day after the S&P 500 posted its worst quarterly performance in two-and-a-half years, shedding 4.6% as investors reacted to Mr. Trump's tariff regime. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the first three months of the year with a 10.4% decline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.2% over the same period.\n\nEven if Trump's tariffs end up being less harsh than feared, the lack of clarity may already be leading U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending.\n\nJohnson & Johnson shares\n\nIn equities trading, Johnson & Johnson slid 3.5% after a U.S. bankruptcy court judge denied the company's settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It's the third time the company's attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts.\n\nShares of PVH Corp., the clothing company formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen, climbed 16% before the bell after it beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter sales and profit targets. PVH, which owns the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, also gave a strong forecast for 2025.\n\nAlso early on Tuesday, the government releases figures on job openings for February. It's a big week for labor market reports, with the weekly layoffs report coming Thursday and the March jobs report set for Friday.\n\nEuropean markets showed strong gains after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers that the world's biggest trade bloc would not cower to U.S. trade demands.\n\n\"Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm counter measures if necessary. All instruments are on the table,\" von der Leyen said.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Officers arrested 39-year-old Damon Gaines of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police. He is facing charges of assault and battery.\n\nGovernment payroll records online identify Gaines as an air traffic controller. He is on administrative leave while the matter is investigated, the FAA said.\n\nCBS News has tried to contact Gaines for comment.\n\nThe union representing air traffic controllers who are typically the people working inside the Reagan control tower declined to comment.\n\nThe incident comes as the situation at the DCA tower has been increasingly tense since a mid-air air collision in January killed 67 people in the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster since 2001. It also comes after a Delta Air Lines flight departing Reagan airport experienced a close call with an Air Force jet after taking off on Friday.\n\nAfter the deadly January crash between a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines flight, the National Transportation Safety Board made a number of recommendations to address a \"serious safety risk\" at Reagan airport, including banning helicopter operations along the route near the airport when runways 15 and 33 are in use.",

National Oceanography Centre\n\nThe camera trap system is thought to have been triggered by strong currents. National Oceanography Centre\n\nThe center's underwater robot came across the contraption when part of its mooring snagged on Boaty McBoatface's propeller. When it was brought back to the surface, author and lifelong Nessie investigator Adrian Shine said he knew exactly what it was.\n\n\"It was a fascinating moment,\" Shine told CBS News.\n\nHe described the camera trap as \"quite ingenious.\" \"[It was] triggered by a bait line, which was above the camera on a float, and if that was pulled, an external magnetic switch was operated,\" he said.\n\nLifelong Nessie investigator Adrian Shine helped identify the camera once it was pulled to the surface. National Oceanography Centre\n\nShine, who set up The Loch Ness Project in the mid-1970s to investigate Loch Ness, said around 24 film exposures had been taken but there was no evidence of Nessie in those pictures.\n\nOnce revealed, the pictures mostly show Loch Ness' dark, murky waters and it is believed the camera could have been triggered by the loch's strong underwater currents.\n\nAccording to Shine, the Instamatic film camera was one of six deployed as part of the project, which was spearheaded by American biologist and scientific director of the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau Roy Mackal. The camera pulled to the surface by Boaty McBoatface was one of three that had been lost in the deep waters during a gale.\n\nThe U.K.'s National Oceanography Centre regularly uses Loch Ness to test its underwater autonomous vehicles. National Oceanography Centre\n\nThe chance encounter came during a routine test of the center's underwater vehicles, which help map seabed habitats.\n\nSam Smith, from the center's Marine Autonomous Robotics Systems group, said, \"While this wasn't a find we expected to make, we're happy that this piece of Nessie hunting history can be shared and perhaps at least the mystery of who left it in the loch can be solved.\"",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHomeowners considering borrowing from their home equity should closely compare their home equity loan and HELOC options this April. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIn the high-interest-rate environment of April 2025, borrowing money can be expensive. Personal loans, for instance, currently carry rates of over 12%. And credit cards? Those average nearly double that. Homeowners, though, are lucky. They have access to a type of borrowing that's often more affordable than more traditional options.\n\nIt's true: With home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), homeowners can often borrow money at interest rates well under 10%.\n\nStill, while these products can both save you on interest, they're not the same. Below, we'll break down how to choose between a home equity loan and a HELOC this April.\n\nStart by seeing how much home equity you could borrow here.\n\nHome equity loans vs. HELOCs: What's the better borrowing option this April?\n\nNot sure which of these home equity borrowing products could work better for you now? Here's what to consider:\n\nA HELOC may be better for lower interest rates — at least in the short-term\n\nHELOC rates are currently slightly lower than those on home equity loans so that right there will save you cash. But on top of this, HELOC rates are also variable — meaning their rate will usually go up or down based on market conditions and, mainly, the actions of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWith the Fed poised to reduce rates later this year — the majority of members expect at least one more rate cut — that would likely mean lower HELOC rates, too.\n\n\"I believe we are likely to see interest rates continue to come down over the coming six to 24 months, so a HELOC may be more favorable at this time,\" says Evan Luchaco, a home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage.\n\nKeep in mind that rates change often, though, so if rates begin to creep up again and you're not able to pay off the balance fast, it could have an adverse effect, resulting in significantly more costs in the long run.\n\n\"HELOCs are generally best when a borrower knows that they will be able to pay the new debt off quickly,\" says Kevin Leibowitz, a mortgage broker at Grayton Mortgage.\n\nSee how low of a HELOC rate you could qualify for here.\n\nA home equity loan may be better if you're thinking long-term\n\nIf you're planning on keeping your home equity product for a while and need an extended period to pay it off, a home equity loan may be the better choice.\n\n\"If a borrower knows that the new debt will be in place for a number of years, then the home equity loan might become a better option,\" Leibowitz says. \"The rate and payment won't change.\"\n\nIt's also better for the more risk-averse consumer who might not be fully secure in their financial situation. \"For the customer who is more conservative financially, a home equity loan is often a more sensible route,\" Luchaco says. \"It provides a secure interest rate.\"\n\nA HELOC is better if you want a financial safety net\n\nYou'll likely want a HELOC if you need a \"just-in-case\" fund or some financing on hand for unexpected expenses.\n\n\"A HELOC can be considered an emergency fund if someone doesn't have one or doesn't have the means to set one up very quickly,\" says Patti Brennan, CEO at Key Financial. \"For example, if/or when we go into a recession and downsizings occur, your boss won't really care if you have money in the bank or a means to pay your bills — but you should.\"\n\nHELOCs can also be the better choice if you have an expense that's extended — a long-term home renovation or recurring tuition payments, for instance.\n\nAs Aaron Craig, vice president of mortgage and indirect sales at Georgia's Own Credit Union, put it, \"If you're not quite sure how much home improvements are going to cost and would like some flexibility to borrow as much or as little as you need as the project progresses,\" HELOCs can be a good choice now.\n\nA home equity loan is better for consolidating debt\n\nFinally, if your goal is to consolidate high-interest debts right now, experts say you're better off using a home equity loan than HELOC.\n\n\"A HELOC can ultimately be dangerous when used to consolidate debt and alleviate monthly payments, but the homeowner doesn't change their spending habits,\" Luchaco says.\n\nThis is because HELOCs allow you to keep borrowing money, usually for up to 10 years. If you pay off your debts and then continue to use those HELOC funds for other non-essential purchases, you could end up with a bigger problem than before.\n\n\"Eventually, that type of homeowner will get themselves into trouble again and inevitably need to sell their home in order to use their remaining equity to pay off the newly acquired debt — or end up in some sort of financial hardship,\" Luchaco says.\n\nTalk to a professional\n\nEvery situation is different, and there are lots of factors to take into account when borrowing from your home equity. If you're not sure which is best for you, talk to a home equity lending professional. They can walk you through your full scope of options and help point you in the right direction both this April and, hopefully, long-term.",

        "content": "What to know about your rights as ICE arrests multiple people for Palestinian protest participation\n\nMinneapolis — A University of Minnesota graduate student who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement was taken into custody because of a drunken driving infraction, not for being involved in protests, federal officials said Monday.\n\n\"This is not related to student protests,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"The individual in question was arrested after a visa revocation by the State Dept. related to a prior criminal history for a DUI.\"\n\nNews of the student's detention - and the lack of an official explanation - sparked student protests and expressions of concern from university and political leaders. Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday that he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about it Friday and was still waiting for further details.\n\nMeanwhile, officials at Minnesota State University Mankato said Monday that one of their students had been detained by ICE as well.\n\nPresident Edward Inch said in a letter to the campus community that the student was detained Friday at an off-campus residence.\n\n\"No reason was given. The University has received no information from ICE, and they have not requested any information from us,\" Inch wrote. \"I have contacted our elected officials to share my concerns and ask for their help in stopping this activity within our community of learners.\"\n\nThe Mankato school didn't name the student or give the student's nationality or field of study. ICE didn't immediately respond to a request for details on that case.\n\n\"This is becoming a deeply concerning pattern, where ICE detains students with little to no explanation ... and ignores their rights to due process,\" U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in a statement. \"I will keep pressing the administration for answers about these arrests and work to get answers from federal immigration authorities about this case.\"\n\nThe University of Minnesota hasn't named its student, either.\n\nThat student, who was detained at an off-campus residence on Thursday, was enrolled in the business school on the Minneapolis campus. University spokesperson Andria Waclawski said the school had no further updates Monday. She said earlier that they were following the lead of the student and respecting their request for privacy, while providing the student with legal aid and other supports.\n\nThe governor said Monday that, \"A deep concern is, here, that no matter what the situation was, in this country, everyone has due process rights and our concern is whether those due process rights are being followed.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. More than half a dozen people with ties to universities are known to have been taken into custody or deported in recent weeks. Most of those detainees have shown support for Palestinian causes during campus protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that 300 student visas had been revoked up to that point, asserting \"we have a right\" to rescind the visas of students who participate in campus protests, despite questions about due process and First Amendment objections.\n\n\"If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa,\" Rubio said. \"If you lie to us and get a visa then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa.\"",

        "content": "Employees across the massive U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday in a major overhaul expected to ultimately lay off up to 10,000 people. The notices come just days after President Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.\n\nSome employees found out they'd been cut when they arrived at work Tuesday morning and discovered their security badges had been disabled. Others waited in long lines to get into their buildings amid the delays and confusion.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan last week to remake HHS which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, monitoring the safety of food and medicine, and administering health insurance programs for nearly half the country.\n\nThe plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers across the country under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.\n\nAs CBS News reported last week, the layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers.\n\nThat's down from around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal records. There were 81,917 at the end of the first Trump administration.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington predicted the cuts will have ramifications when natural disasters strike or infectious diseases, like the ongoing measles outbreak, spread.\n\n\"They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,\" Murray said Friday during a call with reporters.\n\nCuts are also expected at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, as part of the HHS restructuring, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News.\n\nAround 873 staff — two-thirds of its workforce — are expected to be cut from NIOSH, multiple leaders within the agency were told in recent days.\n\nBeyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funds. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost funding, \"some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nUnion representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that between 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated. The department's leadership will target positions in human resources, procurement, finance and information technology. Positions in \"high cost regions\" or that have been deemed \"redundant\" will be the focus of the layoffs.\n\nKennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \"sprawling bureaucracy\" in a Thursday video announcing the restructuring, and said the department's $1.7 trillion yearly budget, \"has failed to improve the health of Americans.\"\n\n\"I want to promise you now that we're going to do more with less,\" Kennedy said.\n\nHHS on Thursday provided a breakdown of some of the cuts:\n\n3,500 jobs at the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects and sets safety standards for medications, medical devices and foods.\n\n2,400 jobs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors for infectious disease outbreaks and works with public health agencies nationwide.\n\n1,200 jobs at the National Institutes of Health, the world's leading health and medical research institution.\n\n300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAt the CDC, most employees haven't been unionized, but interest rose sharply this year as the Trump administration took steps to reduce the federal workforce. Roughly 2,000 CDC employees in Atlanta belonged to the American Federation of Government Employees local bargaining unit, with hundreds more who had petitioned to join this week being added.\n\nBut on Thursday night, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that would end collective bargaining for a large number of federal agencies, including the CDC and other health agencies.\n\nThe erosion of collective bargaining rights was decried by some Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"President Trump's brazen attempt to strip the majority of federal employees of their union rights robs these workers of their hard-fought protections. This will only give Elon Musk more power to dismantle the people's government with as little resistance from dedicated civil servants as possible — further weakening the federal government's ability to serve the American people,\" according to a joint statement Friday by U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, both of Virginia.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "What's in the 80,000 pages of JFK assassination documents released by the Trump administration\n\nOscar-winning director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film \"JFK\" portrayed President John F. Kennedy's assassination as the work of a shadowy government conspiracy, is set to testify to Congress on Tuesday about thousands of newly released government documents surrounding the killing.\n\nScholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy, and the declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on a review by CBS News. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.\n\nThe first hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets comes five decades after the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy as his motorcade finished a parade route in downtown Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nRepublican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who chairs the task force, said last month that she wants to work with writers and researchers to help solve \"one of the biggest cold case files in U.S. history.\" Scholars and historians haven't viewed the assassination as a cold case, viewing the evidence for Oswald as a lone gunman as strong.\n\nStone's \"JFK\" was nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, and won two. It grossed more than $200 million but was also dogged by questions about its factuality.\n\nAmerican director Oliver Stone poses during the photocall for the presentation of his documentary JFK: Case reviewed at the BCN Film Festival in Barcelona, Spain on April 25, 2022. Adri Salido/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nThe last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy \"probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.\" In 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence \"to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.\"\n\nThe Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald worked. Police arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television.\n\nFor Tuesday's hearing, the task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who both have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination. He has praised Luna as being open to new information surrounding the killing.\n\nShortly after taking office in January, Mr. Trump took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The recently released documents about JFK's assassination have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHELOC interest rates have steadily declined over the last six months, approximately. Getty Images\n\nIf you're a homeowner with significant equity in your home (and, right now, the average is around $313,000, so chances are high that you are), you may be contemplating borrowing from it. With cost-effective borrowing options limited in the current economic climate, borrowing against your accumulated home equity has multiple advantages, especially if you do so via a home equity line of credit (HELOC). This product works as a revolving line of credit similar to a credit card, except it uses your home's equity instead. But you'll only have to pay interest on the amount of credit used, not the full line of credit approved for.\n\nAnd right now is a particularly great time to borrow with a HELOC, thanks to an increasingly borrower-friendly HELOC interest rate climate. Before getting started, however, it helps to know some important things about HELOC interest rates this April. Below, we'll break down five important items to know.\n\nStart by seeing how low of a HELOC interest rate you'd qualify for here.\n\nEverything to know about HELOC interest rates this April\n\nHere are the questions (and answers) interested homeowners should know about HELOC rates this April:\n\nWhat are HELOC interest rates now?\n\nThe average HELOC interest rate is 8.01% as of March 31, 2025. That's the average, however, and it's possible that homeowners could secure an even lower interest rate if they take the time to shop around and research lender offers. At the same time, that rate could be even higher if you apply with a mediocre credit score. So, if your credit isn't in good shape first, consider improving it before starting your HELOC borrowing journey.\n\nShop for HELOC rates and terms online today.\n\nWhat's happened to HELOC interest rates so far this year?\n\nHELOC interest rates fell to an 18-month low in January. They then hit a two-year low in February and followed that by dropping to new two-year lows multiple times in March. This has made HELOCs significantly cheaper than home equity loans, credit cards and personal loans, giving homeowners with equity in their homes a clear way to borrow in an otherwise high-rate atmosphere.\n\nWhat's happened to HELOC interest rates over the past six months?\n\nHELOC interest rates over the past six months, or since September 2024 approximately, have fallen by almost two full percentage points, underlining the cost-effectiveness of using this borrowing product this April. On September 4, 2024, the average HELOC interest rate was 9.99% but at 8.01% now, it's almost two points lower. And thanks to a variable rate that changes monthly for borrowers, it could fall even further this April.\n\nWhere are HELOC interest rates headed this April (and beyond)?\n\nIf recent performance is a reliable indicator, HELOC interest rates are likely to continue their downward trend this April and, potentially, even further in the months that follow. Still, economic conditions will need to be right for this trend to continue. That means a consistently falling inflation rate and, theoretically, additional cuts to the federal funds rate (as borrowers saw in the final months of 2024).\n\nKeep an eye out for the next inflation reading, to be released on April 10. If that shows further cooling as it did in the previous report, HELOC rates could come down again. And they'll almost assuredly drop again in the months that follow if the Federal Reserve resumes its interest-rate cut campaign.\n\nIs a variable HELOC interest rate a good idea now?\n\nIf you're looking to secure one of the lowest interest rates possible now, then yes, a variable HELOC interest rate is a good idea now and is one of the few practical ways borrowers can position themselves for lower interest rates without the headache of having to refinance (and having to pay refinancing closing costs). At the same time, a variable rate can rise as easily as it can fall, so the inherent volatility will need to be priced in, particularly when borrowing from such a critical financial asset like your home.\n\nLearn more about borrowing with a HELOC online today.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBy understanding the dynamics of HELOC interest rates, both now and in the recent past and approaching future, homeowners considering this borrowing option can make a more informed and well-rounded decision. With your home functioning as collateral and the risk of losing it to the lender if you can't make your repayments, doing your research and understanding your affordability is key here. So consider speaking to a financial advisor or home equity lender who can answer your questions and help you better understand all of your options.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Residents of the Badger State will have their last chance Tuesday to vote in an unusually high-stakes race for a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.\n\nThe election, which is officially nonpartisan, pits Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who is backed by the Democratic Party, against Republican-endorsed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in what has been the most expensive judicial election in American history. The campaigns and their supporters have spent more than $81 million, attracting endorsements and campaign appearances from Elon Musk, Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders and other national political figures.\n\nThe race is seen by some as an early swing-state test of voter sentiment related to President Trump's performance in the White House, but it's also a crucial statewide race that could swing ideological control of Wisconsin's closely divided highest court.\n\nLiberals currently hold a 4-3 majority, and the court is expected to consider cases related to abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting and election rules.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidates Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford. Getty Images\n\nBy Monday morning, 644,800 advance ballots had been returned, representing about a 40% increase over the advance total in Wisconsin's 2023 judicial race, and that year also set a turnout record. About a third of advance ballots so far have come from heavily Democratic counties of Milwaukee and Dane, in the Madison area, and that's roughly in line with their share of the advance vote in 2023.\n\nNineteen percent of advance ballots have come from the WOW counties in the Milwaukee suburbs of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, which is a couple of points higher than their share in 2023.\n\nGiven that the more liberal candidate won the 2023 race by double digits, the early turnout numbers look good for Crawford. But the bulk of the voting is expected to occur on Election Day, when Schimel could very well close a gap.\n\nMusk, the world's wealthiest person and an ally to Mr. Trump, has personally campaigned and spent big in an effort to sway voters toward Schimel, who both he and Mr. Trump have endorsed.\n\nThat effort nearly collided with the justices currently seated on the state's Supreme Court, when Musk was sued over his promise to hand out $1 million to individual voters at a campaign event over the weekend.\n\nThe court unanimously declined on Sunday to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Musk's checks from going out. At a rally soon after the decision, Musk handed two people oversized posters depicting $1 million checks, declaring that the money was payment in exchange for promises they'd be spokespeople for his political group.\n\nFive of the court's seven justices have endorsed a candidate in the race. The court's liberal justices have endorsed Crawford. One of the court's conservative justices has endorsed Schimel, who wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while campaigning Sunday.\n\nPolls in Wisconsin close Tuesday at 8 p.m., which is also the deadline to get absentee ballots to municipal clerks.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "A federal judge in California on Monday agreed to delay the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program that currently shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from deportation.\n\nUnder a decision announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in February, these migrants were slated to lose their government-issued work permits and deportation protections next week, on April 7.\n\nBut in a scathing decision on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled in favor of TPS holders who filed a lawsuit against Noem's decision and postponed her action until he adjudicates the merits of the case.\n\nChen called Noem's decision \"unprecedented,\" noting that the U.S. government had never before abruptly terminated a TPS program without a significant wind-down period. He said the move appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" about Venezuelans, citing references in Noem's order about alleged gang members from Venezuela entering the U.S. and Venezuelan migrants straining resources in American communities.\n\n\"(T)he Court finds that the Secretary's action threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States,\" Chen wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Chen continued, are likely going to prevail in arguing that Noem's actions \"are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.\"\n\nCBS News has reached out to representatives for the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Monday's court order.\n\nAdvocates for migrants praised the ruling, saying it would curb the Trump administration's plan to carry out the largest deportation campaign in American history.\n\n\"The Court's decision provides a crucial protection against mass deportations for a population that this administration has singled out for extreme vilification,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, the co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law and one of the lawyers in the case being heard by Chen.\n\nCreated by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the U.S. government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. While it does not place beneficiaries on a path to permanent legal residency, TPS allows them to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.\n\nThe Biden administration vastly increased the number of migrants eligible for TPS, creating or expanding programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela and other countries. The Venezuela TPS program is the biggest of its kind, covering roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations in 2021 and 2023.\n\nRepublicans have long criticized TPS programs, arguing they are often extended improperly and that they reward illegal immigration since some of those eligible for the policy are in the country without proper documents. On the first day of his second term, President Trump ordered officials to review TPS programs to ensure they are \"limited in scope.\"\n\nLess than two weeks after that order, Noem announced she was revoking the 2023 TPS designation for Venezuelans and undoing the Biden administration's last-minute extension of the program. While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration persist, she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS policy.\n\nVenezuelans enrolled in TPS through the 2021 designation are slated to keep their status through at least September.\n\nWhen it first offered Venezuelans TPS in 2021, the Biden administration cited the political and economic turmoil in Venezuela under the regime of President Nicolas Maduro. Over the past years, nearly 8 million people have left Venezuela, settling in neighboring South American countries, the U.S. and other nations as part of the largest exodus ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNoem has also announced plans to start phasing out the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, as early as this summer. Advocates have asked Chen to intervene and rule against that move, but the judge has yet to rule on that request.",

        "content": "Five years ago, the CEO of one of the largest pain clinic companies in the Southeast was sentenced to more than three years in prison after being convicted in a $4 million illegal kickback scheme.\n\nBut after just four months behind bars, John Estin Davis walked free. President Trump commuted Davis' sentence in the last days of his first term. In a statement explaining the decision, the White House said that \"no one suffered financially\" from Davis' crime.\n\nIn court, however, the Trump administration was saying something very different. As the president let him go, the Department of Justice alleged in a civil lawsuit that Davis and his company defrauded taxpayers out of tens of millions of dollars with excessive urine drug testing. The DOJ alleged that Comprehensive Pain Specialists made such a \"staggering\" sum from cups of pee that employees had given the testing a profit-minded nickname: \"liquid gold.\"\n\nDavis and the company denied all allegations in court filings and settled the DOJ's fraud lawsuit without any determination of liability. Davis declined to comment for this article.\n\nJohn Estin Davis, former CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists, who was convicted of health care fraud, was granted clemency by President Trump in 2021. At the same time, the DOJ was suing Davis for allegedly orchestrating a much larger health care fraud scheme. Davis and CPS later settled the lawsuit without any admission of wrongdoing. Heidi de Marco / KFF Health News\n\nSince returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has said he will target fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and his Republican allies in Congress have made combating fraud a key argument in their plans to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides health care for millions of low-income and disabled Americans. During an address to Congress last month, Mr. Trump said his administration had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" without citing any specific examples of fraud.\n\n\"Taken back a lot of that money,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We got it just in time.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump's history of showing leniency to convicted fraudsters contrasts with his present-day crackdown. In his first and second terms, Mr. Trump has granted pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes or of interfering with fraud investigations, according to a KFF Health News review of court and clemency records, DOJ press releases, and news reports. At least 13 of those fraudsters were convicted in cases involving more than $1.6 billion of fraudulent claims filed with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nAnd as one of the first actions of his second term, Mr. Trump fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government.\n\n\"It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,\" said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney and law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. \"In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.\"\n\nElberg said considerable fraud in Medicare and Medicaid exists largely because the programs' \"pay-and-chase models\" prioritize paying for patient care first and tracking down stolen dollars second. To prevent more fraud, the programs would likely need to be redesigned in ways that would be slower and more cumbersome for all patients, Elberg said.\n\nRegardless, Elberg said the president's claimed focus on fraud appears to be a pretext for slashing spending that has been legally appropriated by Congress. Mr. Trump has empowered the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which he established and named by executive order, to make deep cuts in federal budgets, halting some medical research and aid programs in addition to cutting spending on climate change, transgender health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\"What's been the focal point to date of the administration is not what anybody has ever referred to as health care fraud,\" Elberg said. \"There is a real blurring — a seemingly intentional blurring — between what is actually fraud and what is just spending that they are not in favor of.\"\n\nJerry Martin, who served as a U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee under President Barack Obama and now represents health care fraud whistleblowers, also said Mr. Trump's focus on fraud appeared to be \"just a platform to attack things that they don't agree with\" rather than \"a genuine desire to root out and combat fraud.\"\n\nEven so, Martin said some of his whistleblower clients have been emboldened.\n\n\"I've had clients repeat back to me 'President Trump says fraud is a priority,'\" Martin said. \"People are listening to it. But I don't know that what he's saying translates into what they believe.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\nA billion-dollar fraud case and needless eye injections\n\nPresidents enjoy the unique authority to erase federal convictions and prison sentences with pardons and commutations. In theory, the power is intended to be a final bulwark against injustice or overly harsh punishment. But many presidents have been accused of using the pardon power to reward powerful allies and close associates as they leave the White House.\n\nMr. Trump issued about 190 pardons and commutations in the final two months of his first term, including for some health care fraudsters convicted of schemes with astonishing costs.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump granted a commutation to Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted in 2019 of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. After he was sentenced, DOJ announced in a press release that \"the man behind one of the biggest health care frauds in history will be spending 20 years in prison.\" Mr. Trump freed him 14 months later.\n\nMr. Trump also granted a commutation to Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who was serving a 17-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million. Melgen falsely diagnosed patients with eye diseases, then gave them unnecessary care, including laser treatments and painful eye injections, according to DOJ and court documents.\n\n\"Salomon Melgen callously took advantage of patients who came to him fearing blindness,\" said a DOJ news release after Melgen was sentenced in 2018. \"They received medically unreasonable and unnecessary tests and procedures that victimized his patients and the American taxpayer.\"\n\nDOJ: $70 million spent on \"excessive\" urine testing\n\nDespite the flurry of pardons and commutations at the end of Mr. Trump's first term, the leniency he showed Davis was unique. Davis was the only convicted health care fraudster to receive clemency while the Trump administration was simultaneously accusing him of more fraud.\n\nAs CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists from 2011 to 2017, Davis oversaw a rapid expansion to more than 60 locations across 12 states, according to federal court documents.\n\nHe was indicted in 2018 for using his CEO position to refer Medicare patients in need of medical equipment to a conspirator in return for kickbacks paid through a shell company, according to court documents. He was convicted at trial in April 2019 of defrauding Medicare.\n\nThree months later, the DOJ filed a fraud lawsuit against Davis and CPS that piggybacked on the claims of seven whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that CPS collected more than $70 million from federal insurance programs for urine drug testing, most of which was \"excessive,\" and that an audit of a sampling of the tests had found at least 93% \"lacked medical necessity.\"\n\nTypically, government insurance programs pay for urine testing so pain clinics can verify that patients are taking their prescriptions properly and not abusing any other drugs, which could contribute to an overdose. Patients could be tested as little as once a year or as often as monthly depending on their level of risk, according to the DOJ lawsuit.\n\nBut Comprehensive Pain Specialists performed \"myriad urine drug testing on virtually every CPS patient on virtually every visit\" then conducted \"at least 16 different types of tests\" on each sample, and sometimes as many as 51, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMr. Trump commuted Davis' sentence for his criminal conviction in January 2021 as the DOJ was finalizing a settlement in the civil lawsuit. The commutation was supported by country music star Luke Bryan, according to a White House statement.\n\nMonths later, with President Joe Biden in office, CPS and its owners agreed to repay $4.1 million — less than 10% of the damages sought in the suit — and the case was closed.\n\nIn the settlement, Davis agreed not to take any job where he would ever again bill Medicare or other federal health care programs. He was not required to personally repay anything.\n\nMartin, who represented one of the whistleblowers who first raised allegations against Davis and CPS, said the leniency that Mr. Trump showed to him and other health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations during his second term.\n\n\"There are a lot of rank-and-file people who are operating at the lowest point in their professional careers, where they've seen a lot of their work essentially be water under the bridge,\" Martin said. \"That's got to be really demoralizing.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

        "content": "Washington —Special elections will be held Tuesday in two safe Republican Florida congressional districts that have attracted serious fundraising from Democrats and increased attention since President Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik's name from consideration for U.N. ambassador.\n\nThe race to replace former Rep. Mike Waltz, who resigned from his seat in Florida's 6th Congressional District to become Mr. Trump's national security adviser, appears unexpectedly competitive, with Democrat Josh Weil significantly outraising Republican state Sen. Randy Fine in a district that Waltz won by more than 30 points in November. Weil, a public school teacher, had raised more than $9 million through mid-March compared to Fine, who brought in less than $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nThe race gained more attention last week when Waltz appeared at the center of a Signal leak, when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen.\n\nThe developments have turned outsized focus toward the contest for the seat representing an area on Florida's Eastern Coast. And though Republicans are not in danger of losing their majority even if Democrats pull off upsets in both contests, favorable results for the GOP would give the party more breathing room as it attempts to pass Mr. Trump's agenda. Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House, with 218 seats to Democrats' 213. There are two remaining vacancies in seats that were held by Democrats who died in March.\n\nIn withdrawing the appointment of Stefanik, a New York Republican who has been among Mr. Trump's most loyal voices in Congress, the president explained that he didn't want to risk further depleting the already narrow majority.\n\n\"We don't want to take any chances,\" Mr. Trump said last week in the Oval Office. \"It's as simple as that. It's basic politics.\"\n\nThe other special election, in Florida's 1st Congressional District in the state's Panhandle, will fill the vacancy left by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose nomination to be attorney general was derailed by a House Ethics Committee report that alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who denied any wrongdoing, withdrew his name from consideration, although he had already resigned from Congress.\n\nThe race, which is seen as less competitive, includes Republican Jimmy Patronis, the state's chief financial officer, and Democrat Gay Valimont, a gun control activist. Patronis had raised $2.1 million as of mid-March compared to Valimont's nearly $6.5 million, according to FEC filings.\n\nThe contests, along with an election for Wisconsin Supreme Court also being held on Tuesday, mark the first elections since Mr. Trump returned to office, in races that are being viewed as key tests for the GOP.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, stopped short of predicting that Democrats would flip either seat on Tuesday, but said the attention on the reliably red districts should serve as a warning for Republicans.\n\n\"These are races that should not under ordinary circumstances be on anyone's political radar,\" he said at a news conference last week. \"What I can say, almost guarantee, is that the Democratic candidate in both of these Florida special elections will significantly over-perform, which will represent another sign that the Republicans are on the run and that Democrats are going to take back control of the House of Representatives next year.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "New evidence changes timeline of Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's last days\n\nA court on Monday cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view.\n\nThe ruling from a New Mexico judge allows the possible release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog.\n\nAll photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.\n\n\"There shall be no depiction of either body in any video production\" or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.\n\nA representative for the Hackman family estate had urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family's constitutional right to privacy.\n\nThe partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nAuthorities have said Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after his wife died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rodent-borne disease. While hantavirus infections are rare, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.\n\nActor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa pose for a portrait in 1986 in Los Angeles, California. Getty Images\n\nHackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.\n\nOne of the couple's three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, was also found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.\n\nAuthorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple's deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.\n\nNew Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.\n\nIn seeking to block the release of records, estate representative Julia Peters had emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and the potential for their dissemination by media. The Hackman family estate also sought to block the eventual release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAn attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during Monday's hearing that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.\n\nThe bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.\n\nCBS News, CBS Studios and The Associated Press intervened in the matter. Gregory P. Williams, an attorney for the news outlets, told the judge that they had previously said in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.\n\n\"There is certainly a public interest in knowing how their deaths were investigated and knowing how that was handled,\" Williams said.\n\nSusan Madore, a publicist who had worked with the Hackmans for years, testified that the couple relished living in Santa Fe because it afforded them anonymity. Hackman retired in the early 2000s.\n\nArakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, an attorney for Hackman's son and daughters highlighted the possible traumatic effects of releasing conversations about the deaths within police body camera videos.\n\nScot Sauder, an attorney for the state medical investigator, told the judge that autopsy reports for Hackman and his wife do not yet exist and won't include past health care information once completed. It can take months for autopsy reports to be completed.\n\nPrivacy likely also will play a role as the couple's estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife while the will she signed that year directed her estate to him. With both dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.\n\nWithout trust documents being made public, it's unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.\n\nHackman's career spanned multiple decades in which he starred in dozens of films. Some of his notable roles included Detective \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection\" (1971), a surveillance expert who suspects a murder in \"The Conversation\" (1974) and a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1992).",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — Senate Republicans are preparing to move forward with a budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda, eyeing a vote later this week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters late last week that the budget resolution is \"in the process of being drafted\" after he and House Speaker Mike Johnson met with top tax leaders earlier in the week to map out the path forward. House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints, but they must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process — a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate.\n\nThough Thune has not committed publicly to moving forward with a resolution this week, a source familiar told CBS News on Monday that Senate Republicans are planning to do so in the days ahead. The budget resolution could come up as soon as mid-week, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, which allows senators to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night.\n\nThune teased the vote on the Senate floor Monday, saying \"in the very near future, we will be taking up a budget resolution to lay the groundwork for legislation to make the 2017 tax relief permanent, secure the border, unleash American energy and provide for our nation's defense.\" He noted that the priorities will be accompanied by \"substantial savings measures.\" Asked by reporters later Monday about the timing, Thune said \"maybe later in the week.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune speaks at a press conference with other members of Senate Republican leadership following weekly policy luncheons, in Washington, DC on March 25, 2025. Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nBudget resolutions serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The final product must be deficit-neutral to comply with reconciliation rules.\n\nThe Senate is expected to set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees in the budget resolution to give them flexibility moving forward. Thune noted that while the instructions given to House and Senate committees \"may look different,\" it's \"simply a function of Senate rules,\" while stressing that \"House and the Senate are united in aiming to do all we can on this.\"\n\nTop Senate Republicans have been pushing to move forward on the bill, including Budget Committee chairman Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, who outlined to reporters last week that \"there's a desire to move the resolution up\" from an initial plan to move on it next week.\n\n\"The sooner you pass the resolution, the sooner the committees are up and running, and the quicker you'll get the reconciliation bill, which is the big prize,\" Graham said.\n\nThe plan could face some pushback from fiscal hawks, who are looking to make deeper spending cuts. With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans can afford to lose just a handful of votes in the budget process. Graham told reporters that \"authorizing committees are going to cut until we run out of votes.\"\n\n\"So to those who want to cut spending, only problem you'll have is being unable to convince 49 of your colleagues of what you want to cut,\" Graham said.\n\nA vote this week in the Senate could set the House on a path to adopt the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.\n\nBut the resolution's biggest hurdle could come from the Senate parliamentarian, who is expected to weigh in in the coming days on an accounting approach, known as the current policy baseline, which Senate Republicans have pursued. As Republicans look to extend the 2017 tax cuts, the approach would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Whether the parliamentarian signs off on the gambit remains to be seen.\n\n\"What we are doing by extending existing tax policy is just that,\" Thune said of the maneuver at a news conference last week, adding that Senate Republicans don't believe that should have to be offset or paid for. \"You're simply extending what already exists.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats have widely opposed the GOP budget plan. But the reconciliation process allows Republicans to move ahead with a simple majority, so they would not need help from across the aisle. The caucus held a strategy call Sunday night on budget reconciliation, a Senate Democratic aid told CBS News.\n\nTop Senate Democrats on Monday slammed the current policy baseline approach in a letter to the majority leader, writing that \"employing this unprecedented gimmick would upend budget law, erode the remaining fiscal guardrails in the budget reconciliation process, and result in trillions of dollars more in federal debt.\"\n\n\"If you and conference go down this road, you will be destroying the last vestige of fiscal discipline left in the reconciliation process,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the ranking Democrats on the Finance and Budget committees, Sen. Ron Wyden and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in the letter. \"No longer would new tax cuts or spending programs ever need to be offset. The lasting consequences to our national debt will be severe.\"\n\nand contributed to this report.",

Despite his heartfelt plea, the ceasefire with Hamas ended this month, with Israel resuming bombing in Gaza. Every bomb that falls jeopardizes the hostages still held in captivity, Bibas said. He spent most of his time in captivity in Gaza's tunnels and lived through bombings.\n\n\"You don't know when it's gonna happen. And when it happens, you're afraid for your life,\" he said. \"The whole earth would move like an earthquake, but underground.\"\n\nYarden Bibas\n\nBibas, his wife Shiri and their two, red-headed sons — 4-year-old Ariel and 9-month-old Kfir — were among those taken hostage during the Oct. 7 Hamas-terrorist attack on Israel, which sparked the war. In all, some 1,200 civilians and soldiers were killed that day and 251 people were abducted.\n\nIn the months since, an estimated 50,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militant combatants. Most of those are women and children.\n\nYarden Bibas 60 Minutes\n\nBibas lived through much of the deadly bombing in Gaza before his release during a January ceasefire. During his time in captivity, he was forced to sit on camera after he was told by Hamas that his wife and sons were killed by an Israeli air raid. Israeli officials have since said that forensic evidence shows Bibas' children were killed by their captors.\n\n\"They were all murdered in cold blood, bare hands,\" Bibas said. \"They [Hamas] used to tell me 'Oh, doesn't matter. You'll get a new wife. Get new kids. Better wife. Better kids.'\"\n\nShortly after Bibas was freed in January, Hamas released the bodies of his wife and children as part of a ceasefire deal.\n\nBibas started advocating for the hostages still in Gaza almost immediately following his own release. He wrote a letter to Netanyahu pleading to stop the fighting. Bibas does not believe continued fighting will encourage Hamas to release the hostages.\n\nNow Bibas is hoping to reach the ears of President Trump.\n\n\"I know he can help,\" Bibas said. \"I'm here because of Trump. I'm here only because of him. I think he's the only one who can stop this war again.\"\n\nBibas said the president should convince Netanyahu and Hamas to agree to another ceasefire.\n\nHe worries about the safety of the hostages still in Gaza, including his best friend, David Cunio, and Cunio's brother, Ariel. Cunio was kidnapped with his wife Sharon and their kids, who were released during the first ceasefire in November 2023. Cunio and his brother are still being held hostage and are presumed to be alive.\n\n\"Probably the hardest thing: I have to move [on] with my life, and David is not with me,\" Bibas said. \"I lost my wife and kids. Sharon must not lose her husband.\"\n\nKeith and Aviva Siegel\n\nBibas is not the only freed hostage hoping for another ceasefire. He's joined by Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American who was also released in January. Siegel's wife, Aviva, was also kidnapped by Hamas and later freed.\n\nKeith Siegel 60 Minutes\n\nThe Siegels lived in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the border with Gaza, and were taken from their home. They were driven into Gaza and taken down into a tunnel.\n\n\"We were gasping for our breath,\" Keith Siegel said.\n\nAviva was with her husband for 51 days, until she was released during a brief ceasefire in 2023. They were held with several women and children, and said there was constant abuse.\n\n\"I witnessed a young woman who was being tortured by the terrorists. I mean literal, you know, torture, not just in the figurative sense,\" Keith Siegel said.\n\nHe said female hostages were sexually assaulted, with other captives made to watch.\n\nSiegel said conditions worsened for him after his wife was released and that early ceasefire collapsed.\n\n\"The terrorists became very mean, and very cruel, and violent,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli-American said he was beaten and starved. His captors would eat in front of him. He said once a month, he would get half a bucket of cold water to clean himself.\n\nHis spirit, he said, was broken.\n\n\"I felt that I was completely dependent on the terrorists, that my life relied on them, whether they were gonna give me food, bring me water, protect me from the mobs that would lynch me,\" he said. \"I was left alone several times and I was very, very scared that maybe they won't come back and I'll be left there. And what do I do then?\"\n\nWith the couple now back home, Aviva Siegel worries over two neighbors — 27-year-old twins Gali ans Zivi Berman — still languishing in captivity in Gaza.\n\n\"There needs to be a deal that will bring them back, and finish with this whole thing,\" she said.\n\nIsraelis still in captivity\n\nAn estimated 24 hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza, including best friends Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David. Hamas took them from the Nova Music Festival.\n\nRecently released hostage Tal Shoham, 40, spent 471 days with them in captivity. Shoham recently met with the parents of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David to tell them about their sons.\n\nReleased hostage Tal Shoham, right, recently met with the parents of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David to tell them about their sons, who are still being held captive in Gaza. 60 Minutes\n\n\"It's important for us to know exactly what's going on with our children,\" parent Ilan Dalal said.\n\nShoham didn't hold back when he spoke with Gilboa-Dalal's parents.\n\n\"One moment he's, like, partying in the Nova, the second moment he's in the worst place in the world,\" Shoham told them of their son. \"It took him, I think, five or six days just to stop crying, to start to realize that this is the reality now.\"\n\nShoham said they were mostly confined to a narrow tunnel, where they were beaten daily and made to share minute amounts of pita bread, rice and water.\n\n\"Sometimes the water tastes like blood, sometimes like iron. Sometimes it was so salty that you could not drink it, but you don't have anything else,\" Shoham said. \"You don't need too much to stay alive.\"\n\nBut they were resourceful, coming up with odd ways to win favors. For instance, they discovered one of the guards liked back rubs.\n\n\"The exchange was that he will get a massage every day and he will bring us some more food. And different food,\" Shoham said.\n\nHamas also brought Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David in a van to watch fellow hostages be released. Hamas released a video of them begging for their freedom.\n\n\"And then they moved them back to the tunnels. So this can be devastating to them,\" Ilan Dalal said.\n\nGalia David, mother of hostage Evyatar David, said she wants everyone to hear about what's happened to the hostages.\n\n\"Maybe someone will hear it and he will save our sons. I don't know,\" she said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Taipei, Taiwan — The Chinese military announced large-scale drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan on Tuesday that include an aircraft carrier battle group, as it again warned the self-ruled island democracy against seeking formal independence. The joint exercises involve navy, air ground and rocket forces and are meant to be a \"severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,\" according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command. No operational name for the drills was announced or previous notice given.\n\nChina considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favor their de-facto independence and democratic status. Any conflict could bring in the U.S., which maintains a series of alliances in the region and is bound under U.S. law to treat threats to Taiwan as a matter of \"grave concern.\"\n\nTaiwan's Presidential Office said in a message on the social media platform X that \"China's blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS.

Mr. Trump has threatened to impose trade tariffs on Japan, a key U.S. ally, sparking more concern.\n\nThe two sides agreed to accelerate plans to jointly develop and produce missiles such as Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missiles, or MRAAM, and consider producing SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, to help ease a shortage of munitions, Nakatani said. The ministers also agreed to speed up the process involving the maintenance of U.S. warships and warplanes in Japan to strengthen and complement Japanese and U.S. defense industries.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo, March 30, 2025.

The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency.\n\nLai's words and actions appear to have especially angered Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose previous attempts at intimidation have had little effect on the Taiwanese public. Those have often been timed in response to expressions of Taiwanese independence, including a visit by then U.S. House leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nA new propaganda push by China\n\nChina's PLA also released a series of videos to publicize their military exercise, including one in which they depict Lai as a green parasite \"poisoning\" the island by hatching smaller parasites. The video shows Lai's head on the body of a bulbous green worm, with a pair of chopsticks picking him up and roasting him over a flame set over Taiwan.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, seeking to wear down Taiwanese defenses and morale, although the vast majority of the island's 23 million people reject its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. In recent years, it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises, from sending small numbers of individual fighters and surveillance planes to sending groups of planes, drones and ships.\n\n\"The PLA organized naval and air forces to practice subjects such as sea and land strikes, focusing on testing the troops' ability to carry out precision strikes on some key targets of the Taiwan authorities from multiple directions,\" said Zhang Chi, a professor at China's National Defense University in an interview with Chinese state television.\n\nTaiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen since 2016, when China cut off almost all contacts with Taipei.",

        "content": "Nearly all employees at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an agency created by Congress to support American museums and libraries, were put on administrative leave Monday, according to a Trump administration official. An IMLS employee and a union representing them said all employees were put on leave, but an administration official said 20% of IMLS employees were not.\n\nThe move still impacted about 80% of IMLS' roughly 77-employee staff.\n\nEarlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the agency, as well as six other governmental entities, to be reduced to \"the minimum presence.\" A few weeks ago, employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were spotted in the IMLS building in Washington, D.C., to attend the swearing in of the new acting commissioner, Deputy Labor Secretary Keith Sonderling.\n\nAFGE Local 3403, the union representing IMLS employees, said the notification to employees came after a \"brief meeting between DOGE staff and IMLS leadership.\" It said museums and libraries would no longer be able to contact IMLS staff for updates about their funding. The message also said the status of previously awarded grants is unclear, but that funding is likely to be terminated.\n\nIMLS has approximately 77 employees and was created by Congress as an independent federal agency in 1996 through the Museum and Library Services Act to support American museums and libraries. Last year, the institute awarded $267 million in grants across the country, with a focus on helping to organize book drives and museum field trips in areas without existing access to libraries or museums.\n\nEveryLibrary, an organization supporting libraries across the country, called the move to put employees on leave \"potentially devastating for institutions that depend on federal support to meet local needs.\"\n\n\"This is not merely a bureaucratic activity; it is a crisis for the library, museum, and archive communities across the United States,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nAn email to IMLS employees Monday from the agency's human resources director stated there was no \"disciplinary purpose\" being served in putting these employees on administrative leave. The notice said email accounts would be disabled and instructs employees to leave laptops and work cellphones in the office, according to text of the email shared with CBS News.\n\nOne employee said Sonderling's arrival at the agency seemed to signal that employees would soon be put on administrative leave. They have not been told what will happen to the agency, though one possibility entails shrinking the staff footprint to 30 employees and moving them to the Labor Department, according to the Federal News Network.\n\nA White House official said the restructuring \"is a necessary step\" to fulfill Mr. Trump's executive order and would ensure \"hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.\"\n\n\"These changes will strengthen IMLS's ability to serve the American people with integrity and purpose,\" they added.\n\nMr. Trump also signed an executive order this month that targeted funding for the Smithsonian Institution programs that haves what he characterizeds as \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have previously called for the agency to retain its federal funding and responsibilities under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.\n\n\"We write to remind the Administration of its obligation to faithfully execute the provisions of the law as authorized,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Sonderling. \"IMLS grants enable libraries to develop services in every community throughout the nation, including people of diverse geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds, individuals with disabilities, residents of rural and urban areas, Native Americans, military families, veterans, and caregivers.\"",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHomeowners contemplating borrowing home equity should use the lull in Federal Reserve meetings this April to shop online for low rates and attractive terms. Westend61\n\nHome equity loan interest rates are driven by multiple factors. One of the most prominent is the Federal Reserve, and the bank's interest rate and monetary policy, specifically. When rates are hiked, rates tend to rise for many borrowing products, arguably most noticeably in the home equity borrowing market. At the same time, when inflation is cooling, the Fed feels more comfortable cutting interest rates, as it did three times in the final four months of 2024. As a result, interest rates on home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have steadily declined, with HELOCs, in particular, dropping to 18-month and two-year lows, respectively, just in the first three months of 2025.\n\nBut there's no Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for this April and the bank won't meet again until May 6 and May 7. Understanding this break in the calendar, then, prospective home equity borrowers should be strategic in their approach. Below, we'll detail three home equity moves homeowners should consider making, specifically without an April Fed meeting scheduled.\n\nStart by seeing what home equity loan rate you'd currently be eligible for here.\n\nHome equity moves to make without an April Fed meeting scheduled\n\nHere are three smart home equity moves homeowners should consider making this April, minus a formal Fed meeting scheduled:\n\nTake the time to shop around\n\nIn a month with a looming Fed meeting, borrowers will understandably feel compelled to act quickly, particularly if they're looking to lock in a low home equity loan rate (which is fixed). Waiting for the Fed to take rate action, or even hint at future rate action, could adversely impact what rates borrowers can secure.\n\nBut with no meeting set for April, homeowners can take a deep breath and spend more time shopping around to find low rates and attractive terms. Remember that you don't need to use your current mortgage lender to secure a home equity loan or HELOC, so use the 30 days in April to shop around online to see what offers are available. You may be surprised at what you ultimately find when you can take the time to do your research and compare and contrast offers.\n\nStart shopping for home equity loans and HELOCs online today.\n\nCompare a fixed rate versus a variable one\n\nA home equity loan has a fixed interest rate (which is generally advantageous), but home equity loan rates are higher than HELOCs now (which is not). At the same time, HELOC rates, despite a steady decline over the past six months, can rise as easily as they can drop. And that can happen even before the May Fed meeting if lenders assume that rates will remain higher for longer. That will be less of a concern with a home equity loan, whose rate will stay static unless refinanced.\n\nThe good news is that you have some time to closely compare your fixed rate and variable rate options this April. Consider calculating your repayment costs over the common 10 and 15-year repayment periods to better determine both short and long-term affordability (and don't forget closing costs).\n\nDetermine your exact financing needs\n\nYou should never rush into securing home equity financing as your home functions as collateral in this scenario. Fail to make your home equity loan or HELOC monthly repayments and your home could be repossessed by the lender. One way to avoid this is by determining your exact financing needs, so you only borrow what you need and no more.\n\nAnd this should be simple to do this April with the threat of a Fed meeting, and, potentially, a significant interest rate impact, not such a timely concern. That said, be sure to still monitor the wider rate climate, particularly the next inflation report that's released on April 10, as that could impact what the Fed does in May – and what home equity lenders potentially do before then.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA break in the Federal Reserve meeting schedule, especially considering that the bank has left rates paused in its first two meetings of 2025, could be a welcome opportunity for homeowners considering borrowing from their home equity now. To take advantage this April, however, they should take the time to do their due diligence by shopping around for rates and lenders. They should also do the math and compare the pros and cons of a fixed home equity loan rate versus a variable HELOC one, all while precisely determining their exact financing needs. By using this April to do the hard work and research, borrowers can better improve their chances of home equity borrowing success both in May and in the months and years that follow.",

Carolyn Kaster / AP\n\nThe drone appeared with Seth Brown batting for the Athletics in the seventh inning of the Chicago Cubs' 18-3 rout and it delayed the game for a few minutes.\n\n\"I think for me, I didn't want to cut my fingers off. I always see that on the news, people hurt themselves when it's hovering or whatever and their hand gets caught in it,\" said the 22-year-old Thalblum, a sixth-year bat boy. \"I tried to catch it by the bottom and it was there for me so I just grabbed it and then I just started whacking the wings of it, basically with the bat, just to snap them off so it wouldn't fly away from me because I was going to take it behind the wall. We couldn't figure out what to do with it and it was trying to fly away from me.\"\n\nThalblum is the son of longtime A's visiting clubhouse manager Mikey Thalblum.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell was impressed. When the drone was spotted by some Chicago players, Counsell alerted plate umpire Adrian Johnson, who hadn't seen it.\n\n\"I guess that's the world we're in right now,\" Counsell said. \"But it was funny because it looked like the drone was trying to fly away, it was trying to fly Mikey's son away, too. It's life in 2025.\"\n\nStewart Thalblum had noticed the drone the previous at-bat, a first for him, and then saw Johnson stop play — so he went to work.\n\n\"Everybody was just looking at it for a little while and I've never had something like that happen,\" Thalblum said. \"I was asking around, everybody's looking and nobody from security or anything had gone out there so I was like, 'I don't know whose responsibility it is,' so I was like, 'OK, maybe it's mine.'\"\n\nDad was plenty proud of his son — again.\n\n\"I'm proud of him for a lot of other reasons more so than getting a drone, just for being a good kid,\" the father said, chuckling and not surprised at the fast thinking. \"He's a good clubbie.\"",

Getty Images\n\nWith the tax filing deadline fast approaching, millions of Americans are rushing to finalize their returns. This time of year can be extra stressful if you have unpaid IRS taxes from previous years and owe more this year.\n\nBack taxes often snowball into a financial burden with growing penalties and interest. The IRS can also levy bank accounts, place liens on your property, garnish your Social Security disability check and damage your credit score. These repercussions underscore the importance of tackling this debt promptly.\n\nThe good news is that several relief programs exist for struggling taxpayers. These could reduce or eliminate what you owe under certain circumstances. So it helps to know the qualifying criteria. Below, we spoke to experts about what to know, specifically.\n\nStart tackling your tax debt here now.\n\nHow to qualify for IRS tax forgiveness, according to experts\n\nTax problems rarely resolve themselves and often compound over time. \"In my experience, if you owed last year, then you'll probably owe this [year] and next year,\" warns Adam Brewer, tax attorney at AB Tax Law. With ongoing tax obligations mounting, many taxpayers need relief options.\n\nJoseph Leocata, JD, a certified public accountant and tax controversy advisor with Berkowitz Pollack Brant Advisors + CPAs, says tax forgiveness becomes viable \"when the balance becomes insurmountable, when facing financial hardship or if the IRS intensifies collection actions.\" Below are three tax relief avenues to explore:\n\nOffer in compromise (OIC)\n\n\"An offer in compromise is an agreement with the IRS to settle your tax debt for less than you owe,\" explains Logan Allec, a certified public accountant and owner of Choice Tax Relief. The IRS accepts offers in compromise through the following approaches:\n\nDoubt as to collectibility: Make a case to the IRS that they should accept what you're offering because there's \"doubt\" that it could collect more without causing economic hardship.\n\nMake a case to the IRS that they should accept what you're offering because there's \"doubt\" that it could collect more without causing economic hardship. Doubt as to liability: Provide evidence that you don't owe the amount the IRS claims you do.\n\nProvide evidence that you don't owe the amount the IRS claims you do. Effective tax administration: Show that while you can pay the full amount, doing so would create an inequitable situation due to exceptional circumstances such as serious illness.\n\nOf the above, \"the most common is doubt as to collectibility,\" Allec says. Applying for it involves these steps:\n\nSubmit Form 433-A (OIC) with complete details about your assets, income, expenses and liabilities\n\nInclude Form 656 (the official offer in compromise contract)\n\nProvide supporting documents for all financial information\n\nPay the application fee and the non-refundable initial payment\n\nAfter reviewing your financial information, the IRS calculates your reasonable collection potential. For your offer to succeed, Allec notes that \"your offer amount should be at least the amount of your reasonable collection potential.\"\n\nExplore your tax debt forgiveness eligibility here.\n\nPenalty abatement\n\nPenalty abatement offers relief from the additional charges the IRS adds to your tax debt. \"In certain circumstances, the IRS may fully or partially abate — that is, forgive — the penalties it has assessed against you,\" Allec explains. The IRS offers two main types of penalty relief:\n\nFirst-time abatement: This program is available to taxpayers with no penalties in the previous three tax years. It forgives failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties for one tax year.\n\nThis program is available to taxpayers with no penalties in the previous three tax years. It forgives failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties for one tax year. Reasonable cause abatement: You must prove that circumstances beyond your control prevented tax compliance. Examples include natural disasters, serious illness or an inability to obtain necessary records. The IRS reviews these requests case-by-case with an \"element of subjectivity,\" according to Allec.\n\nCurrently not collectible (CNC) status\n\nThe IRS has 10 years from the date of assessment to collect a tax. \"We've seen millions of our clients' tax debts written off due to the IRS's collection statute expiring,\" Allec says.\n\nSometimes this happens without effort if the IRS isn't actively pursuing collection. But in many cases, tax professionals help clients enter formal arrangements such as \"currently not collectible\" status. Though this doesn't get rid of the debt right away, it could delay aggressive collection actions until the statute expires.\n\nTax relief qualification criteria to know\n\nTax professionals highlight three qualification criteria for IRS tax relief programs:\n\nFinancial hardship: \"Taxpayers qualify for most types of tax relief if they demonstrate to the IRS that making payments toward their tax debt causes financial hardship,\" explains Leocata. This means you can't cover your tax debt and basic living expenses.\n\n\"Taxpayers qualify for most types of tax relief if they demonstrate to the IRS that making payments toward their tax debt causes financial hardship,\" explains Leocata. This means you can't cover your tax debt and basic living expenses. Current compliance: You must be current on filing requirements and tax deposits for the current year. This shows the IRS you're trying to meet your obligations.\n\nYou must be current on filing requirements and tax deposits for the current year. This shows the IRS you're trying to meet your obligations. Installment payment threshold: \"If the balance is more than $25,000 but less than $50,000, [you must] pay off the balance within 72 months by direct debit to avoid a lien filing,\" Brewer advises. This is crucial if you're trying to buy, sell or refinance a home without the IRS getting in the middle of the transaction.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTax relief services exist for many financial situations, and your circumstances will determine which option works best. So, consult a professional at a reputable tax relief company. They can assess your situation, help gather required documentation and guide you toward the optimal approach.",

The most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted transatlantic air travel for months.\n\nIceland saw at least seven volcanic eruptions during 2024 near Grindavik, leading to the evacuation of the town. After the seventh eruption, people were evacuated from about 50 homes in the fishing village, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency.\n\nIceland is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Trump says he is not joking about seeking a third term as president\n\nWashington — President Trump suggested in an interview this week this week that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice.\n\nThe president told NBC News in an interview Sunday that he's \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility in recent months. He also said that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"\n\nTrump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and … I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"\n\nExperts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.\n\nHere's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:\n\n\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"\n\nMr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.\n\n\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"\n\n\"Am I allowed to run again?\"\n\nShortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.\n\n\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice — or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"\n\nThen on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"\n\n\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"\n\n\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"\n\nAt the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again — that's the expression.\"\n\n\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.\n\nOn Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.\n\n\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"\n\n\"There are methods\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.\n\n\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\nThe president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he spoke with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.\n\n\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.\n\n\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"\n\nMr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.\n\n\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "Miller Gardner may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after tests revealed elevated levels of the potentially lethal gas in the hotel room he had been staying in, according to Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ.\n\nGardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family. According to a statement from the Gardners, he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill.\n\nOIJ Director Rándall Zúñiga said Monday that a team testing the family's hotel room found high levels of carbon monoxide, and that the room where they stayed was situated next to \"a specialized machine room\" that could have caused the contamination. The test results led the OIJ's investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Zúñiga said in a video statement in Spanish.\n\n\"It is also important to highlight that this entire investigation has been closely coordinated with the United States FBI, and we await the final results of the forensic toxicology to determine exactly what caused this young man's death,\" Zúñiga said.\n\nThe hotel said in a statement Monday to CBS News, \"We are heartbroken by the tragic loss that recently occurred on our premises due to causes that have not yet been confirmed. We are diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation. We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident.\"\n\n\"Out of respect for the ongoing judicial process and the family's privacy, we will refrain from commenting on any unconfirmed hypotheses or possible causes,\" the hotel added. \"Our priority remains the safety and well-being of our guests and staff, and we reaffirm our ongoing commitment to the highest operational standards within our facilities.\"\n\nCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is produced when fossil fuels are burned. Cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators can all produce carbon monoxide. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be determined. OIJ previously said autopsy results could take two to three months.\n\nThe Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort in Manuel Antonio, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San José.\n\nThe family did not provide further details about who else had gotten sick or what symptoms they experienced.\n\nAn obituary posted online described Miller Gardner as an Honor Roll student who played football and baseball and loved traveling with his family.\n\n\"The void Miller's passing leaves in the hearts of his family, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches and others will be felt for years,\" it said. \"Miller's time here with them was brief but his spirit will carry on forever through those who were impacted by the way he lived.\n\nOIJ had said earlier in the investigation that the cause of death may have been food poisoning, but the investigation was ongoing.\"\n\nThe update on a possible cause of death comes days after authorities in Belize said three American women who were found dead in their hotel room in the country last month had died of carbon monoxide poisoning.",

        "content": "Washington — Democratic Sen. Cory Booker delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor overnight, continuing into the morning on Tuesday in a protest of the Trump administration's policies.\n\nBooker, a 55-year-old who first came to the Senate in 2013 and is now the fourth-ranking Democrat, began speaking around 7 p.m. on Monday and said he would continue speaking \"for as long as I am physically able.\" As the sun rose on Tuesday morning, he was still speaking from the Senate floor.\n\nBooker cited the legacy of leaders, like late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis, whom he said stood up \"when this country was facing crossroads, was facing crises, they stood up.\"\n\n\"I rise today in an unusual manner,\" Booker said, before invoking Lewis' refrain to \"get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America.\"\n\n\"Tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble,\" Booker said, pledging to disrupt the normal business of the Senate. \"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis… These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker speaks during the Senate Democrats' news conference in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

The New Jersey Democrat spent some of that time reading letters from constituents who say they have been harmed by the Trump administration's policies, and condemning the administration more broadly — from trade wars to mass firings to deportations and threats to Medicaid.\n\nBooker occasionally yielded to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sens. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York as they echoed his concerns with the administration and encouraged his effort.\n\nAfter 7 a.m. Tuesday, Booker acknowledged the 12 hours that has passed, saying he's \"wide awake\" and would \"stand here for as many hours as I can.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "At least two-thirds of the staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, are expected to be laid off as part of a restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., multiple federal health officials tell CBS News.\n\nAround 873 staff are expected to be cut from NIOSH, multiple leaders within the agency were told in recent days, out of the 10,000 workers that are slated to be laid off from across the Department of Health and Human Services this year.\n\nNIOSH was created by Congress in 1970 to study worker safety and health. Workplaces often turn to the agency to investigate outbreaks and injuries, like after the deadly fungal outbreak that shuttered a Michigan paper mill in 2023.\n\nHowever, multiple officials said that new \"health hazard evaluation\" probes by NIOSH had been paused for several weeks under travel and communication restrictions imposed soon after the Trump administration took over.\n\nHealth officials bracing for deep cuts within NIOSH include workers at the agency's Pittsburgh and Spokane offices, where some 200 staff — the vast majority of those working out of the locations — are expected to be impacted, according to a notice sent to their union.\n\nAmong the teams where \"all employees\" are expected to be impacted, according to the notice, are the office of NIOSH's director; the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, which is tasked with vetting and approving N95 respirators among other personal protective equipment; as well as several branches dealing with miner safety and health.\n\nThe \"probable effective date\" for the cuts is June 30, according to the letter sent to the union. (Read the full letter below.)\n\nLilas Soukup, president of AFGE 1916, confirmed the union had been forwarded the notification from HHS on Monday, but said they had received little guidance from HHS on the details of the cuts.\n\nHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the planned cuts.\n\nMultiple federal health officials said that official notices to workers that they would be cut as part of a \"reduction-in-force\" have not yet been received, including at NIOSH.\n\nWhile managers within several HHS agencies were told last week to expect notices to be emailed as soon as Friday, staff at several health agencies said none were received as of the close of business on Monday.\n\nManagers say they have been largely left in the dark about the details of the cuts, and given little opportunity to provide input into the process.\n\nNIOSH's teams currently sit within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They oversee several programs authorized by Congress which are expected to be impacted, ranging from a national registry to study cancer rates in firefighters to a program to monitor and treat people sickened during the rescue and cleanup of the September 11th terror attacks.\n\nUnder the reorganization plan outlined by Kennedy last week, the reduced NIOSH would be combined into a new Administration for a Healthy America along with several other agencies, like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nOther offices set to be merged into AHA have also been warned to expect steep cuts, including the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy.\n\nOther changes at the CDC\n\nMultiple Trump administration aides have been targeting a rapid implementation of the restructuring, with Trump officials telling career staff to lay out plans to implement Kennedy's restructuring within weeks.\n\nSeveral offices are expected to be merged into the CDC under the restructuring, ranging from staff working out of the department's global affairs teams to most of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR.\n\nASPR oversees the nation's pandemic stockpiles of vaccines, medications and personal protective equipment. It also runs several emergency preparedness and response efforts, including medical teams that are dispatched to respond to disasters.\n\nAs part of internal merger plans shared with CBS News by multiple health officials, ASPR's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, team would be cleaved off and moved elsewhere.\n\nAmong the pandemic preparedness projects funded by BARDA had been several studies of experimental COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Past BARDA awards have funded the development of vaccines and treatments that were successfully deployed to fight other outbreaks, like the spread of mpox in 2022.\n\nAt least one of those studies, research by vaccine-maker Vaxart into a COVID-19 vaccine that could be taken by mouth, has been paused by the Trump administration.\n\nOfficials said they expect BARDA will likely be merged with the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health or ARPA-H, a different medical research agency.\n\nRead the notification letter sent from HHS to the union about the job cuts:",

        "content": "What to know about Florida's special elections\n\nEarly on during Donald Trump's first term as president, Republicans were at risk of losing a reliably red congressional seat in Kansas.\n\nHis decision to nominate Mike Pompeo as CIA director led to the need for a special election to fill the former congressman's seat representing Wichita and a sprawling portion of the state along the Oklahoma border.\n\nMonths earlier, Pompeo had comfortably won the district by 31 points. But by the time polls closed in the April 2017 special election for the seat, Republican candidate Ron Estes narrowly avoided an upset, going on to win the seat by around six points.\n\nThat harried 2017 race underscored a familiar dynamic in American politics: the importance of special elections for House seats in a bitterly divided Washington and the long-shot opportunity of an opposing party to flip a district in what can be a low turnout affair. It's one that has taken on particular resonance amid the harsh partisan division that has gripped Washington.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission records from 2017 to the end of 2024, control of a House seat flipped less than 15% of the time in a special election during that timespan. Those odds spotlight the stark challenge Democrats are facing on Tuesday in the special election for two reliably red seats in Florida that were held by Republicans Matt Gaetz and Mike Waltz.\n\nAfter winning his seat by 32 points in the 2024 general election, Gaetz left Congress during his abandoned attempt to become Trump's attorney general. Waltz won his seat by 33 points last fall before resigning to become national security adviser.\n\nIn the race to replace Waltz, Democratic candidate Josh Weil has vastly outraised Republican state Sen. Randy Fine, leading to surprising anxiety on the right for a seat that was expected to easily remain in GOP hands. In recent days, Trump himself has attempted to boost Fine while campaign finance records show the Elon Musk-founded AMERICA PAC has dedicated close to $77,000 to support the state senator in a relatively small but notable foray into the contest.\n\nEven in the seven special House elections since 2017 where control of a district changed hands, unique dynamics were sometimes at play. When Alaska Democrat Mary Peltola won the seat that had been held by Republican Don Young in August 2022, she faced two Republican challengers in a contest decided through the state's brand of ranked choice voting.\n\nAnd when California Republican Mike Garcia and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi won their special contests, they were running to replace politicians who had faced scandal.\n\nThere remains a certain level of unpredictability with special House elections, and despite the attention they receive, they can become more of a snapshot in time rather than a true sign of what will happen in the next general election.\n\nAfter his narrow 2017 special election victory in Kansas, Estes faced the same Democratic challenger in the 2018 midterms.\n\nEstes won by more than 18 points and remains in Congress.",

But even more sinister is the administration’s rejection of race as a “social construct,” which is nothing short of an expression of a belief in racial purity and white supremacy.\n\nEven more sinister is the administration’s rejection of race as a “social construct.”\n\nOne of the things that has Trump angry is “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit at the American Art Museum that innovatively positions nearly 100 sculptures alongside statements about scientific racism. That’s the discredited belief that there are biologically distinct races of people, with some more superior than others. The exhibition examines how artists and art objects have assisted, reflected or challenged such racist thinking since the 18th century, but Trump, in his executive order expresses disappointment that the show “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.”\n\nHolding that race is not a biological reality is not a mere view. It’s a fact, and the rejection of that fact is a key component of white supremacist thinking. Trump’s executive order claims race-centered ideologies are detrimental to our shared culture but is silent on the fact that white supremacy, which his executive order promotes, has proved to be the greatest, most deadly identity politics of them all. See slavery. See the westward expansion of the United States and Manifest Destiny.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has tried to overhaul the way we understand American history. On the heels of the Black Lives Matters protests following George Floyd’s murder, Trump issued an executive order to create the 1776 Commission, a team of conservative politicians, activists, and pundits (none of them professional historians) to develop a “patriotic education” that rescued American history from identity-driven revision that emphasizes critical thinking over patriotism.\n\nThe “1776 Report” was meant as a repudiation of the influential New York Times’ “1619 Project” that reoriented America’s founding myths through the lens of the Transatlantic slave trade. One of Trump’s final acts in office was the official release of that “1776 Report,” and one of President Joe Biden’s first acts in office was to rescind it through his own executive order.\n\nLike the “1776 Report,” the current executive order targeting the Smithsonian is preoccupied with the nation’s founding. It charges Vice President JD Vance with undoing “false revisions” that have brought “negative light” to our founding principles and insists — falsely — that the U.S. has always been a vehicle for universal freedoms.\n\nLike the “1776 Report,” the current executive order targeting the Smithsonian is preoccupied with the nation’s founding.\n\nThe administration demands that the Smithsonian – a sprawling network of 21 museums, research centers, an arboretum and a zoo — reflect its version of national identity by the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in July 2026. The Smithsonian is not entirely funded by the federal government, but enough of its budget relies on congressional appropriations that it’s always been vulnerable to political whims.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that a backward-looking political movement that seeks to “make America great again” wants its version, and only its version, of the past on display at our country’s highly visible cultural institutions. While people have always disagreed over what happened in the past and how it impacts where we find ourselves today, the Smithsonian is an institution that has helped steer people away from mythologies.\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian opened in 2004, breaking new ground with its focus on the representation of national racial and ethnic minority experience. The NMAAHC finally opened in 2016 during the last months of President Barack Obama’s presidency, 13 years after president George W. Bush signed the legislation creating it. Though the late Rep. John Lewis introduced the bill to create the NMAAHC and Bush signed it into law, its existence should be credited to everyday people who pushed to see a truthful portrayal of themselves and their history in the nation’s highest institutions.\n\nBut this is not all that Trump has in mind when he mentions “restoring truth and sanity.” It’s about rolling back social progress. The administration singling out the NMAAHC — incorrectly suggesting that it frames nuclear families, hard work, and individualism as “aspects of White culture” — is itself bizarre, but its underlying biologically essentialist take on society is even more troubling. It mentions the Smithsonian’s upcoming American Women’s History Museum, criticizing it for including nonbinary and trans women in its displays, saying that the museum should not “recognize men as women in any respect,” such as “male athletes participating in women’s sports.” Not satisfied with preventing trans women from playing women’s sports, the Trump administration appears to want to erase these communities from sight or even memory.\n\nThe demand for more diverse and inclusive stories on the National Mall goes back generations.\n\nThe demand for more diverse and inclusive stories on the National Mall goes back generations and the fight won’t stop with this executive action. As long as there are monuments, memorials, and exhibitions claiming to represent the public, the public will push back against those it finds to be misleading and offensive. In response to Trump’s administration scrubbing government websites of what it terms DEI content, the American Historical Association has condemned that “federal censorship of American history.”\n\nThe question of “who owns history” has always been a political one mired in power struggles, and Thursday’s executive order reveals that the stakes of this struggle are greater than ever. This is not just about representations. It’s about knowledge itself and the use of the knowledge to justify inequality.\n\nThere’s a reason people in Trump's administration seem more bothered by the idea of equity than diversity or inclusion: They don’t seem to think we’re equal and they’re going after all content that suggests we are. They believe there is a natural order of human beings — a biologically rigid sytem of race — that puts them at the top. And they want to force our most celebrated historical institutions to back them up.",

        "content": "The headline on the NBC News report probably raised some eyebrows: “Trump says he’s ‘very angry’ and ‘pissed off’ at Putin during an NBC News interview.” The report explained that Donald Trump, responding to Russia’s Vladimir Putin’s latest criticisms of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, complained that the comments were “not going in the right location.”\n\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.\n\nIf the goal was to generate a great many headlines about Trump being “angry” with his ally in Moscow, the comments were a great success.\n\nBut some skepticism is in order.\n\nFor now, let’s not dwell on the fact that it’s hard to imagine the Trump feeling genuine outrage about Putin criticizing Zelenskyy given the frequency with which he has criticized Zelenskyy. Instead, let’s consider what the Republican president has done, rather than that he’s said.\n\nFor example, the American president first threatened to impose harsh new sanctions on Russia in late January, and then he did nothing. Trump made related threats earlier this month, and again, there was no follow-through. As the Republican repeats a similar line, it’s tough to imagine the Kremlin feeling especially anxious about the White House’s next move — especially amid reports that the U.S. administration isn’t overly eager to enforce existing sanctions on Russia.\n\nBut while the administration’s line on sanctions is important, let’s also not overlook what the White House has done since Trump returned to power to help the Putin regime.\n\nAnd did I mention that Senate Republicans, at Trump’s behest, confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s director of national intelligence, despite her habit of echoing Russian propaganda? Because that happened, too.\n\nYour mileage might vary, but this does not seem to reflect an American president who’s “very angry” with the Russian leader.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "With his choice for drug czar, Trump adds to his team of Fox-affiliated amateurs",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Nearly eight years ago, Donald Trump nominated Republican Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy — a position best known to the public as the nation’s “drug czar.” That did not turn out well.\n\nFollowing explosive reporting from The Washington Post, which found that the GOP congressman championed legislation that hindered federal agents from going after the Big Pharma firms that flooded the country with addictive opioids, Marino’s nomination collapsed and he withdrew from consideration.\n\nEight years later, the president has a new drug czar in mind, who’s notable for different kinds of reasons. The Washington Post reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Friday that he intends to nominate Sara A. Carter, a Fox News contributor, to serve as director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. “From Afghanistan to our Border, Sarah’s relentless pursuit of Justice, especially in tackling the Fentanyl and Opioid Crisis, has exposed terrorists, drug lords, and sex traffickers,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, misspelling her first name.\n\nOne of the reasons the Carter nomination stood out is the growing list of Fox News personalities who’ve landed powerful positions on Team Trump. In January, The New York Times published a tally and found 19 “former Fox News hosts, commentators, on-air medical experts, producers and other personnel” who’d landed jobs in the Republican administration. Soon after, Media Matters published a revised total, putting the new number at 20. (The list did not include Attorney General Pam Bondi, who briefly moonlit as a guest host of a Fox News program while she was serving as Florida’s chief law enforcement official.)\n\nAs March got underway, the president also appointed Fox News personalities Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, and as March neared its end, Trump added yet another Fox News contributor to his White House operation, tapping Carter to serve as the drug czar.\n\nBut complicating matters is the nominee’s resume. As a Stat News report explained, “Carter’s selection comes as a surprise: Her background is not in drug policy, public health, or law enforcement, and she has never served in government.”\n\nOr put another way, Carter will be an amateur, joining Trump’s team of amateurs.\n\nIt is not exactly a secret that the incumbent president sees governing expertise and policymaking experience as qualities to be avoided. Indeed, during the Republican’s first term, those with expertise and experience tended to be the people who discouraged the president — the first chief executive in American history to reach the Oval Office without any experience in public office at any level — from taking steps he was eager to take.\n\nAs a result, Trump appears to have gone out of his way to lean into his preference for amateurs in a second term, choosing inexperienced and unqualified loyalists for much of the White House Cabinet.\n\nThose who celebrate rookies in positions of influence have reason to celebrate. Those who value qualifications have reason to worry.",

        "title": "Trump appears to be already laying the plans for a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump threw down the gauntlet to people who want to preserve constitutional democracy in this country. He told NBC’s Kristen Welker that he is “not joking” about the possibility of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment’s prohibition on any person being “elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nWhen asked how he would get around those words, Trump said ominously, “There are methods which you could do it.” I will leave it to others to identify loopholes in the language of the 22nd Amendment, assuming that the president cares about such niceties. Already, Trump is laying the groundwork for a third term, separate from the debates over the 22nd Amendment, by destroying or intimidating institutions that might stand in his way and claiming unconstitutional authority to control elections.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future.\n\nWe saw further evidence of this strategy on Friday when the president brought another prominent American law firm to heel. The terms of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom’s surrender erode its independence, assure it will be a vassal of MAGA-world well into the future, and show Trump’s determination to ready the way to end free and fair presidential elections three years from now.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future. Attacking, discrediting, intimidating and silencing both critics and the institutions that support criticism is familiar in regimes that seek to consolidate their power in the hope that they will never relinquish it. We see signs of this strategy in the president’s attack on law firms, universities, the free press and judges. His executive orders are consolidating his power and easing us toward a nondemocratic future.\n\nRecall that Trump urged his supporters last year to “get out and vote, just this time.” He explained that if they did, they “won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore ... ”\n\nOn Sunday, the president signaled that even if the 2028 election is held as scheduled, he wants to ensure it would not be competitive, just as Viktor Orbán achieved in Hungary. What Trump would consider an achievement is, as The Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum writes, an autocratic takeover. Since Orban won a second term as Hungary’s president, he has mixed paeans to populism and family values with the destruction of press freedom and academic freedom and the politicization of the courts and the civil service. That has eased his way to claim emergency powers and amend Hungary’s constitution, even as the country has fallen into poverty and corruption has become legalized.\n\nHoward Simon, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, explains that “capturing or marginalizing independent centers of thought and dissent that could challenge their authority” is what authoritarians do.\n\nThat brings us back to Skadden Arps, which last week became the second firm to cut a deal with the administration in the wake of Trump’s executive orders targeting various law firms. Skadden had not been the subject of an executive order, and three firms have already successfully challenged the orders in court. But Trump said the firm agreed to “essentially a settlement,” including “a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services during the Trump Administration and beyond.”\n\nIf the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the president insisted that some of the ransom he extracted from Skadden to stay out of his line of fire would be devoted to “ensuring fairness in our Justice System.” Note also, the open-ended phrases like “and beyond” and “at least.” Whatever happens in the 2028 election, you can rest assured that Skadden Arps will not represent anyone opposing Trump or seeking to hold him accountable.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that many other firms are unwilling to take on clients who are Trump opponents. “The president is following a playbook from other countries whose leaders have sought to undermine democratic systems and the rule of law, including Russia, Turkey, and Hungary,” writes the Post’s Michael Birnbaum. “Leaders in those countries have similarly attacked lawyers with the effect of hollowing out a pillar of justice systems to expand their power without violating existing laws.”\n\nIf that were not enough to convince pro-democracy forces to mobilize now to ensure we have a free and fair election in 2028. The president’s recent executive order on elections purports to seize powers for himself from both the states and the independent Election Assistance Commission. Linda Meyer, emeritus law professor at Quinnipiac University, says, “The decentralization of voting systems has been a guarantee of integrity in federal elections because federal employees in the current administration cannot control the entire process. This EO is targeted to wrest control over voting from states and allow the feds to get info about how each person votes.”\n\nIn what Meyer calls the “worst case scenario,” Trump can use his executive order to “target federal enforcement of this EO in [Democratic] areas and throw out votes there … while leaving [Republican] districts alone. Perhaps he can also find out exactly who voted for him and who didn’t and ‘investigate’ only those registrants who voted against him.”\n\nFor someone like Trump, who thinks an election can only be fair if he wins, the temptation to use his order that way may prove irresistible. For those who believe that the 2028 elections can be free and fair no matter what Trump does, the president’s executive order on elections proves that he thinks otherwise.\n\nAnd as The New Republic’s Michael Tomasky points out, Trump’s actions at the Defense Department, starting with the nomination of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have all been undertaken with the goal of “purging … an independent, rules-based military in favor of a military loyal to a single leader.” The result is that “there’s no one around to stop Trump from declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution or even an election.”\n\nRegardless of whether the courts rule on the constitutionality of a third term for Trump, he is already preparing to make their rulings moot through means that have nothing to with the 22nd Amendment. If the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly. Political leaders, lawyers and election experts must map a strategy for stopping the president. And the rest of us should prepare to copy the strategies for mass mobilization and protest used to save democracy in other countries. There is no time to waste.",

        "title": "Elon Musk's Wisconsin voter giveaway raises serious questions",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Here’s a simple question: Should a rich person be allowed to write you a check for voting the way they want?\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the answer is complicated, as it depends on how the offer is structured and how prosecutors and courts interpret various state statutes.\n\nBut set that aside. Don’t even look at it from an ethical or moral perspective. Just ask yourself: Practically, is that a good idea?\n\nThe question has come up because billionaire federal contractor Elon Musk is trying several creative ways to encourage turnout in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race he’s taken an interest in. But history has shown that if this works and it remains legal, it won’t be long before other billionaires adopt similar tactics.\n\nGiving voters cash directly is just cutting out the middlemen of campaign consultants and ad makers.\n\nIf that happens, sweepstakes could become a staple of every election cycle as billionaires compete to offer you cash. You could call it Balance-of-Powerball, maybe, or MAGA Millions.\n\nIt’s perhaps inevitable that we would end up here. After the Supreme Court began dismantling the campaign finance system with the 2010 decision in Citizens United, corporations and the wealthy have found more and more creative ways to spend money on elections. Giving voters cash directly is just cutting out the middlemen of campaign consultants and ad makers.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the specifics of this case.\n\nTwo political action committees linked to Musk, America PAC and Building America’s Future, have disclosed spending about $17 million on the Wisconsin race, while Musk donated $3 million to the state Republican Party, according to ProPublica. They and other big spenders have helped push overall spending on the race to more than $80 million, making it the most expensive judicial race in American history.\n\nBut Musk didn’t stop there. In true entrepreneurial fashion, he looked for other ways to influence the race.\n\nFirst, America PAC put together a two-sentence petition “in opposition to activist judges,” offering $100 to any registered voter in Wisconsin who signed it and another $100 for any voter who referred another person to sign it. In exchange, voters just have to submit their full name, email, mailing address and cellphone numbers — all valuable information for anyone running a get-out-the-vote effort, especially for a low-turnout judicial election.\n\nIt’s not the first time Musk’s PAC has used this tactic. In the run-up to the November presidential election, America PAC ran a “sweepstakes” offering million-dollar prizes for voters who signed a petition that seemed designed to gather names for a get-out-the-vote effort in swing states. Musk’s own lawyers admitted in court that the “winners” of the prizes were not actually randomly chosen but were more like paid spokespeople.\n\nOfficially, the giveaways are just for voters who signed a petition. But let’s be real. The PACs wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t think it would help Musk’s preferred candidate, Brad Schimel. Musk is not exactly known for charity. (In fact, his private charitable foundation did not give away the minimum amount required to avoid tax penalties for three years in a row, most recently missing the mark by $421 million.)\n\nWhen you think about it, the million-dollar giveaway even seems a little cheap.\n\nMusk is currently worth $337 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A million dollars to him is equivalent to about one-hundredth of a cent to a person making $100,000 a year. He could give a million dollars to half the people who’ve already voted in Wisconsin, and he’d still be the 11th richest person in the world.\n\nThe giveaway tactic has survived court challenges before, so it seems like it’s probably on solid ground, legally. The PAC has already identified a voter in Green Bay, Scott Ainsworth, as the recipient of its first $1 million check. Ainsworth posed for a photo with a giant check like in those old contests from the 1980s with Ed McMahon and the “Prize Patrol.”\n\nThe giveaway tactic has survived court challenges before.\n\nBut Musk then went further, posting on X, the social media platform that he owns, that he would give away two more checks for $1 million each to attendees of a Wisconsin event “limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election.”\n\nElection law expert Rick Hasen wrote that because those checks would only be given to people who have voted, they would “appear to violate the plain meaning” of a state anticorruption statute. The post was later deleted, and the Wisconsin attorney general is seeking a court order to stop that particular giveaway.\n\nAgain, “Is this legal?” is a question for the attorney general and the courts. But it’s not the question under consideration here.\n\nOne of Musk’s stated reasons for getting involved is so the Wisconsin court will approve a gerrymandered map that gives Republicans a slight edge in the U.S. House of Representatives. (One might also note that Tesla is currently suing over a Wisconsin law that bars its dealerships.) But whatever Musk’s reasons for using his insane wealth to influence the election, the effort is unseemly.\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, it doesn’t matter what his motivations are. You might even agree with the next billionaire who wants to try such tactics — or at least favor the same outcome as them. But is this how we want to run our democracy, by dangling cash in front of voters? What next, scratch-off ballots with random prizes for voting “correctly”?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In America, our leaders shouldn’t hide from the people they represent. That is why I recently held town halls in three congressional districts — California’s 22nd, 40th and 41st districts — that are key for winning back the House in 2026. All three are currently held by Republicans, and I plan to travel to red districts in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Nevada and Ohio in the upcoming months.\n\nWhile GOP lawmakers are canceling town halls after being booed and protested, I am working alongside community leaders and advocates to build a movement with two goals: mobilize voters in swing districts and block Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid and education funding.\n\nMeetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy.\n\nAmericans are scared and they deserve the chance to ask their representatives why they voted for a budget plan that hurts the working class. With that in mind, I am visiting districts where there is a high percentage of residents on Medicaid. I am spending my time and resources immersed in these districts — meeting with working-class Americans and organizing. In the 22nd district, where I held my first town hall, 64% of residents are on Medicaid. It’s deeply disappointing that their own member of Congress wouldn’t show up to discuss his vote on a budget that would cut this program.\n\nRepublicans tried to dismiss my town halls as a “stunt,” but meetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy. I hold one in my own district every single month, and I believe it is something that every member of Congress should do in person — no matter how tough the questions might be.\n\nAround 1,000 people came to each of my town halls, ready to ask questions and fight for change. In rural, deep red California, where last cycle a few hundred people showed up at such events, this turnout was historic. I heard from attendees who had never seen so many Democrats gather in their area before. While there was excitement and readiness to mobilize, people were also emotional and angry about how this administration is impacting their lives. And though they were upset with their own Republican members of Congress, they were also fed up with the Democrats in Washington who are failing to fight back against the cuts that will put their lives in danger.\n\nAcross the three town halls, the same questions kept coming up: What are Democrats going to do? What can I do? It’s critical that our party recognizes that people feel angry and want change.\n\nThere are five steps that we must take right now.\n\nFirst, we need to flip three Republican votes on the budget reconciliation bill GOP leaders are putting together in Congress. This legislation slashes funding to Medicaid and education. By sharing stories about the consequences of ripping away money for Medicaid and schools, we can embarrass Republican representatives to change their vote and put the well-being of their constituents over their loyalty to Trump.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment.\n\nSecond, Democratic leaders should outline a clear organizing plan for 30 Republican-held districts that are competitive. This plan should include resources for potential volunteers, we should direct them to what they can do in these districts. This can mean hosting town halls, running phone banks, registering people to vote, knocking on doors and sharing stories on social media. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, is hiring full-time organizers in GOP representatives’ districts to get out the vote for local races.\n\nThird, we need an army of people in red districts distributing information. In Bakersfield, a woman at my town hall told me she has been delivering food to friends and neighbors in need while explaining how the Republicans and Trump are cutting SNAP and other benefits. Our party needs to recruit people and provide resources to spread information within communities about the harm Republicans are causing.\n\nFourth, we need candidates who can run in these districts at all levels of government. During the town halls, I met remarkable community leaders, parents and young people who are eager to get involved. Our party should make it a top priority to invest in candidates who decide to run for these seats.\n\nFinally, we need a vision that helps the working class and gives Americans hope for the future. At town halls and other local events, we must offer a plan for how we’re going to improve people’s lives when we take back the House. It should include specifics like a higher minimum wage, Medicare for All, $10-per-day childcare, 10 million new units of housing, and new tech and advanced manufacturing jobs to increase communities’ wealth and income.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment. We must acknowledge voters’ fury, help them organize and offer concrete policies for a better country. That is how we build a movement, defeat the far-right and overcome the deep political nihilism in our country.",

        "title": "Justices Sotomayor and Jackson criticize court’s refusal to clarify criminal appeal rights",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court exercises power not only in how it decides cases but in which cases it chooses to decide. We were reminded of this reality by a new dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat dissent came Monday on the court’s order list, a routine document publicizing action in pending high court appeals. That action is mostly unexplained refusals to hear petitions for review. But sometimes the justices make their thoughts known. That’s what happened in the case of Missouri death row prisoner Lance Shockley, whose petition the majority rejected over Sotomayor’s dissent.\n\nThe legal issue presented by Shockley’s appeal might sound dry, but it is quite important.\n\nIt takes four justices to grant review. The two-justice dissent therefore reinforces the power the court has in shaping its own docket, as well as the importance of the court’s membership to how that docket is shaped. Sotomayor and Jackson have previously called attention to criminal cases their colleagues have refused to hear. They’re two of the three Democratic appointees on the nine-justice court with six Republican appointees.\n\nThe legal issue presented by Shockley’s appeal might sound dry, but it is quite important. It involves something called a “certificate of appealability,” which state prisoners must secure in order to press appeals in federal court. The ability to obtain such certificates differs around the country, and by turning down Shockley’s appeal, the justices turned down the opportunity to clarify the rules and make the law uniform.\n\nThe federal circuit in which his case proceeded has a stricter process than other circuits. So even though a judge voted to grant him the ability to appeal, that judge was overridden by other circuit judges, thus depriving Shockley of an appeal. Sotomayor wrote that she would have granted review to resolve the differences among the circuits “and decide whether the Courts of Appeal can dismiss an appeal after a judge votes to grant a certificate.”\n\nThe Obama appointee wrote that Shockley’s case “exemplifies the problems” with the approach taken by the St. Louis-based circuit in his case. He was convicted of killing a police officer after the prosecution argued he committed the crime because the officer was investigating his role in a drunken-driving incident that resulted in the death of Shockley’s sister-in-law’s fiancé.\n\nDuring jury selection, a potential juror said he had written and self-published a book, but Shockley’s lawyer didn’t follow up on what it was about. He became the jury foreperson.\n\nThat unexplored aspect of the juror’s background turned out to be important because, Sotomayor recounted, quoting a previous ruling in the litigation, the book was a “fictionalized autobiography” describing the “brutal and graphic revenge murder of a defendant who killed the protagonist’s wife in a drunken-driving accident.” The book’s protagonist was a fictionalized version of the juror who “viewed the defendant as escaping justice in the court system because the defendant received only probation following his conviction,” Sotomayor recounted. The foreperson brought the book to deliberations and handed it out to other jurors.\n\nYet “inexplicably,” as Sotomayor put it, Shockley’s counsel declined to take testimony from the foreperson or other jurors in support of a mistrial. “As a result, the trial court did not hear evidence regarding the foreperson’s alleged bias and misconduct or its effect on other jurors, ... some of whom later indicated that they had looked through the book,” the justice wrote. She called it “difficult to see” how the defense’s approach “could fail to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Nonetheless, Shockley couldn’t press his claim on appeal due to the 8th Circuit’s rejection of his certificate of appealability, even though a judge on the circuit wanted to grant him one.\n\n“Had the Court instead followed the approach taken in the Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, that error would have been avoided,” Sotomayor wrote, joined by Jackson, a Biden appointee.\n\nAgain, the legal question here isn’t whether Shockley would ultimately succeed in his appeal but whether he could press it at all. The court’s refusal to settle the matter one way or the other means that the rules will continue to operate differently in different courts around the country.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In spring 2024, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that found a government official could not use her position to punish a disfavored political organization by going after the third parties that did business with it.\n\nLikewise, President Donald Trump’s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional. But unless lawyers stand up to the president and clients stand by their lawyers, the damage to the legal system will be profound.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional.\n\nClients and lawyers must band together against these blatantly illegal actions by the Trump administration and flip the script: They need not defend their own actions but, rather, force government attorneys who may seek to punish the clients of any “disfavored” law firms to justify such unconstitutional efforts, which will be impossible to do.\n\nSo far, the president has targeted five private law firms and the clients they represent, claiming that his administration will punish those clients who have the temerity to do business with those firms. Two of these firms, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, have capitulated to this pressure, expressing fears that the president’s attacks threaten their business model, and they will lose clients who might not want lawyers representing them who have such a bad relationship with the federal government.\n\nThis fear is certainly real, but if the president can scare clients away from the firms that might take positions against his administration, there will be fewer and fewer lawyers willing to take such stands. If that happens, our system of rights, protected by law, and not dispensed at the fiat of the executive, will crumble. But here’s the thing: such actions by the president are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nLast year, in a case filed by the National Rifle Association, on facts eerily similar to those surrounding the president’s actions, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, found that the efforts of a state agency in New York to punish companies that did business with the NRA violated its free speech rights enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nWhile it is deeply troubling that some firms feel the need to appease the White House in the face of such unconstitutional retribution, it will take more than just a handful of firms to resist such bullying. And if such resistance does not materialize, the threats to the rule of law will only increase, and our legal system will not serve to protect everyone’s rights or facilitate the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n\nIt is in everyone’s best interest — even those clients who might fear retaliation from the Trump administration for retaining disfavored firms — to condemn the president’s efforts to attack members of the legal profession simply for playing their essential role in our legal system. These clients should stand by their lawyers and those lawyers must turn the tables on their opponents. They must force government lawyers who might take punitive action on behalf of the president to justify such unconstitutional behavior in court. Since government lawyers take an oath to the Constitution, they, too, have a duty to resist facilitating such punitive and unconstitutional actions.\n\nAddressing U.S. attorneys in 1940 about the role of the prosecutor in a society that abided by the rule of law, then-Attorney General Robert Jackson — who would also serve as a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and was later a Supreme Court associate justice — explained: “While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries.\n\nIn the last light of the first Trump administration, Justice Department lawyers refused to help the president remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Recently, federal prosecutors resisted pressure to dismiss the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. As one of those lawyers, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten, explained: “Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way. If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries. Remember, President Richard Nixon, too, cycled through several lawyers until he found someone willing to fire the special prosecutor investigating him, but the “Saturday Night Massacre” also helped lead to Nixon’s ultimate demise.\n\nThe ability of lawyers and their clients to operate free of such animus is an essential element of our legal system and the rule of law itself. And everyone benefits by a functioning legal system: a financial institution under investigation, a worker cheated out of a fair wage or someone facing deportation.\n\nIn a democracy that promises “Equal Justice Under Law,” a phrase chiseled above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court building, lawyers are critical to deliver on the promise of such equal justice, not for some, but for all. Attacks on lawyers — even elite ones — are designed to bring the entire legal system to heel.\n\nTurning to Robert Jackson once again, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, writing for the Supreme Court, he set forth what should be our national True North when it comes to speech and action disfavored by government officials: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s attacks on law firms are designed to not just dictate orthodoxy, but also to bend the legal system to President Trump’s will. These seemingly petty actions, from high officials, are setting us down a path where the legal institutions designed to protect everyone will no longer serve to check abuses of power. Everyone within the legal system — its judges, lawyers, clients and average citizens — must resist such efforts and do so together.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 30 episode of \"Ayman.\"\n\nWashington has been in a frenzy over the Trump administration’s Signal scandal, in which some of the president’s top officials were caught discussing a bombing campaign in Yemen in an unsecured group chat that somehow included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nDespite all these questions, somehow the most important part of this story isn't getting any attention in elite Washington circles.\n\nPeople were outraged. Many wondered how this could have happened. Some pressed for national security adviser Mike Waltz, who added Goldberg to the chat, to resign. Questions have also swirled about another chat participant, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked if Hegseth could have possibly been drinking before he sent the military plans. There’s also a question about why no one has been fired yet. (President Donald Trump said Saturday that no one will be.)Despite all these questions, somehow the most important part of this story isn’t getting any attention in elite Washington circles. And it’s this: Why is America bombing Yemen in the first place? How many people are being killed in these bombings? Who are they? If Congress hasn’t voted on it, are the bombings unconstitutional? Are they a violation of the United Nations Charter?\n\nTo be clear, American attacks on Yemen didn’t just start with Trump. For years, Houthi rebels in Yemen have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a major trade route. The attacks started shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and the Houthis say they won’t stop until Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has ended.\n\nIn response to these attacks, Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on the Houthis. Shortly after, Biden admitted those strikes weren’t successful. However, he also pledged to continue them. And now it’s Trump’s turn to pick up where Biden left off. The president is doing so without any debate or congressional approval. In March, he declared the group a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSome may remember that as a candidate, Trump pledged to end America’s era of endless wars. It was a smart campaign strategy. The American people are sick and tired of these wars. But as soon as Trump retook the White House, he did just the opposite. He’s ramped up bombings on Yemen. He has also effectively given a green light to Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu to end the ceasefire in Gaza. On Iran, Trump told my colleague Kristen Welker: “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.” On Greenland, Trump told Welker, “I never take military force off the table.”\n\nSo far, this president isn’t a peacemaker, and he’s not ending America's forever wars — he’s threatening to start new ones.\n\nBut that doesn’t seem to be of concern to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They’re concerned about keeping American secrets safe, and the bombing campaign itself is just background noise.\n\nSo far, this president isn't a peacemaker and he’s not ending America's forever wars — he’s threatening to start new ones.\n\nIt’s not just the politicians who are missing the real story here. In an interview with NPR, Goldberg was asked about how, in the aftermath of his story, there has been little focus on the over 50 people, including women and children, who were killed in these strikes and whether he believed people were “burying the lead.”“I don’t know if we’re burying the lead, because, obviously, huge breaches in national security and safety of information — that’s a very, very important story, obviously,” Goldberg responded.\n\nThis is the perfect example of a Washington controversy: Democrats and Republicans are screaming at each other while the most powerful voices on both sides support the same underlying policy — a seemingly illegal war on a sovereign Middle Eastern country without congressional approval.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Constitution’s authors clearly saw Congress as being the first among equals in the three branches of government. The legislative branch was granted sole authority over some of the most powerful aspects of the state, including taxation and declarations of war. It was left to the first Congress to finish filling out most of the document’s details, like determining the size of the Supreme Court and the scope of the executive departments under the president.\n\nThe Republican leaders of the 119th Congress seem to have entirely forgotten their place in the federal pecking order. There are few GOP legislators these days who are willing to present themselves as an equal of President Donald Trump, let alone willing to tell him what to do. Their prostration before Trump has reduced the most powerful branch on paper to petitioning the president’s court for the means to achieve even Congress’ most modest goals.\n\nThe Republican leaders of the 119th Congress seem to have entirely forgotten their place in the federal pecking order.\n\nTrump, in his race to rip out the gears of government and illegally tear down what Congress has established, has made no secret of this new power dynamic. Congressional Republicans have offered little public outcry against the president usurping their power, slashing whole agencies and departments their predecessors established under federal law. Not only that, but the legislature’s new deference to the White House is compelled to take a bizarre detour through billionaire Elon Musk, who in his role as the de facto head of the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency appears to have more control over the Republican agenda than House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nBehind closed doors, Republicans are desperate to keep Trump and Musk’s cuts from hurting them with their constituents — or at least to get some kind of heads-up from DOGE’s hatchet men. The New York Times on Friday reported a behind-the-scenes look at how Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., leapt to protect federal offices that serve his constituents and provide jobs in his district. Rather than using any of his influence as chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Cole and his aides had to reach out to Musk and DOGE, hat in hand, to ask them to reconsider.\n\nAlongside his counterpart in the Senate and the head of the House Ways and Means Committee, Cole is a key gatekeeper of the power of the purse. In the past, he would have been rightly seen as one of the most powerful figures in Washington. The power the speaker and majority leader wield over those committees has been used in turn to boost their own influence. Members hustled hard for earmarked funds to bring federal projects to their states and districts, which the president’s administration would then carry out. It has historically been a tangible way for lawmakers to show that they were getting things done in Washington.\n\nNow things are entirely reversed, as the White House asserts total control over federal projects, leaving personal appeals to Musk and his loyal staffers as the only way for Republicans to stave off politically damaging cuts. While the earlier system was undoubtedly partisan, there was always a chance the next election would put the gavel back in the hands of the current ranking member.\n\nBut Democrats now find themselves iced out of the decision-making process entirely, as The Boston Globe reported earlier this month:\n\nRepresentative Jake Auchincloss, a [Massachusetts] Democrat, said that he tried to get in touch with DOGE about a particular concern — he wouldn’t elaborate on the inquiry or explain how he conveyed it — but that ‘DOGE had every opportunity to engage with me in good faith and stiff-armed me.’\n\nThat seems to suit the GOP’s congressional leadership just fine. If the only purpose of this Republican Congress is to follow the president’s instructions (however capricious or arbitrary), then there’s no need for Democratic input. Speaker Johnson is obeying Trump’s directive to deal simultaneously with an annual spending bill and reupping the 2017 tax cuts, despite the risk that figuring out all the details may be too much for his fragile caucus to bear. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is busy trying to figure out how to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent like Trump wants without driving up the national debt by several trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nThe urge to please Trump has Congress scrambling to carry out his whims, bending over backward to do so without relying on a single Democratic vote.\n\nThe urge to please Trump has Congress scrambling to carry out his whims, bending over backward to do so without relying on a single Democratic vote. Thune spent last week preparing to lobby the Senate parliamentarian to let those costly tax cuts dodge the 60-vote threshold for its budget bill. If he fails, he’ll either need to convince his caucus to overrule her or find enough Democrats to break a filibuster. Meanwhile, Johnson was left to figure out what to do with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the former No. 4 member of his leadership team. She stepped down from that role, but her nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been pulled to protect the GOP’s exceedingly slim House majority. Anything to avoid engaging with Democrats and confronting the idea Congress should be more than a rubber stamp for the president.\n\nUnder the weight of Trump’s gravitational pull, the milelong stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue that separates the Capitol from the White House has compressed into a singularity. When facing voters next fall, congressional Republicans are hoping to do so lauding not their own victories but those of the president and the richest man in the world. It should be embarrassing for a member of the U.S. Congress to campaign on their proximity to power — but that seems to be good enough in the shameless vacuum of ambition that is laying ruin to the Founders’ temple to democracy.",

        "content": "Before neo-Nazi Anders Breivik massacred 77 people in Norway in 2011, he emailed a 1,518-page document, a compendium of his own writing and other far-right texts, to over 1,000 people. The deranged screed warned that Muslim immigration to Europe amounted to an “invasion” of people — whose culture was “incompatible with Western society — that would lead to the “cultural and demographic suicide” of the continent.\n\nEarlier this month, the vice president of the United States went on TV to say the same thing. Speaking with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, JD Vance asserted that Germany is suffering an “invasion” of people who are “totally culturally incompatible” with “Western civilization.” This purported “invasion,” Vance said, will lead to a “civilizational suicide” if it’s not stopped.\n\nIt barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Donald Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers. I’ve witnessed this process of normalization over the last eight years as a reporter covering the far right, seeing neo-Nazi talking points, especially around immigration, enter the mainstream discourse with horrifying, accelerating speed.\n\nIt barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers.\n\nI fear now that many of us here in America still haven’t registered the logical endpoint of such rhetoric, which both dehumanizes subgroups of human beings and presents them as an existential threat. I fear that even as the Trump-Vance administration now embarks on its extralegal campaign of mass deportation — paired with a campaign to rip away the judiciary of its power to keep the White House in check — many Americans are reluctant to come to terms with the idea of sprawling concentration camps, and worse, in America today. But the extreme actions and rhetoric being taken by the administration are not dissimilar from those deployed in the early stages of some of the worst regimes of the 20th century.\n\n“Concentration camp regimes always need a group they can turn into outsiders by making its members seem so dangerous that the government needs to remove those people from society,” Andrea Pitzer, author of “One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps,” told me. “You can’t typically do that without years — years! — of rhetoric demonizing them. Even with the Nazis, it took more than five years from Hitler becoming chancellor of Germany until the mass roundup of Jews as a group began with Kristallnacht in November 1938.”\n\nTrump, Vance and the GOP, of course, have spent years demonizing immigrants, the rhetoric reaching a fever pitch during the 2024 election, with Trump saying immigrants were “poisoning the blood of the country” — a phrasing that bore an unnerving resemblance to wording in Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” — and with Vance spreading the vicious lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were stealing and eating their neighbors’ pets.\n\n“Over time, this demonization creates real fear and gets citizens to go along with measures like concentration camps,” Pitzer said, adding that members of the Trump administration — including Trump, Vance and Elon Musk — have brazenly used racist and dehumanizing language. “By using this kind of language, they’re not just nodding to the same source material of eugenics from a hundred years ago; they appear to be cosplaying earlier fascist leaders, with aspirational nostalgia for their power and abuses.”\n\nThe last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come. There was the abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was clearly detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University, as his crying, eight months’ pregnant wife looked on, recording it. (The Justice Department alleges Khalil withheld required information about his past employment in Syria and his membership in certain groups when he applied for permanent resident status.)\n\nThere was a video of masked ICE agents — essentially secret police — near Boston stopping and arresting Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national and PhD student at Tufts University. Ozturk, who is in the U.S. on a valid visa, was targeted for having “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” according to the DHS, an apparent reference to an op-ed she published in a student newspaper arguing that Tufts should divest from companies tied to Israel. She was taken to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana.\n\nThe Trump administration is proud of what it’s doing.\n\nThere was the deportation of 250 purported Venezuelan gang members to a notorious gulag in El Salvador with no due process, in defiance of a federal court order that the plane deporting them turn around and come back to America, a photographer witnessing the inmates be slapped and kicked and shoved, capturing the moments when their heads were forcibly shaved.\n\nThere were the deaths of two immigrants at the Krome North Processing Center in Miami, which has been described as “hell on Earth,” with videos capturing detainees held “like sardines in a jar,” sometimes without access to food, water or toilets.\n\nThe Trump administration is proud of what it’s doing, blasting out news releases and social media posts bragging about its latest detention or forced deportation. “Following my previously signed executive orders, I proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a radical foreign Pro Hamas student on the campus of Columbia University,” Trump wrote on Truth Social after Khalil’s arrest. “This is the first arrest of many to come.”\n\nIn support of his “stiff-arm saluting” billionaire “first buddy” Musk, the president also suggested that he would send anti-Tesla protesters to the infamous prison in El Salvador, where inmates are made to do forced labor. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,” Trump wrote, again, on Truth Social. “Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.”\n\nThis week the U.S. homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted a video of herself to X visiting the El Salvadoran prison, standing in front of a cell packed with shirtless brown men with shaved heads, staring silently at the camera from behind bars as Noem, wearing a baseball cap, warned immigrants that they too could end up in this gulag. “I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you can face,” she said.\n\nAnd last month, the White House posted a deeply disturbing, dehumanizing video on X appearing to show ICE officials placing immigrants in handcuffs before they boarded a plane for their deportation. “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,” the caption read, using the initialism for autonomous sensory meridian response — a pleasant physical sensation prompted by typically soft sounds. In this case, the sound was of human beings being put in chains. Pitzer recently went viral on Bluesky for noting that historically “concentration-camp regimes were proud of what they were doing and wanted attention for it.”\n\nIn Myanmar in 2015, the regime allowed journalists to visit the camps where Rohingya Muslims were being detained. In Augusto Pinochet’s Chile in the 1970s, photographers were allowed into the National Stadium, where people were being detained and tortured. “Even the Nazis allowed New York Times and Times of London reporters into their early concentration camps in 1933,” Pitzer told me. “They wanted their targets to be terrified, but they were proud of what they were doing.”\n\nThe last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come.\n\nFor now, the administration is focused on pro-Palestinian activists and immigrants they insist are “gang members,” often with thin evidence and no due process. But as the famous Martin Niemöller poem suggests (“First they came for the communists / and I did not speak out / for I was not a communist …”), fascistic regimes eventually come for the rest of us, too.\n\n“The arc of concentration camps is twofold,” Pitzer explained. “First, there’s supposedly some very bad group so dangerous that the government says they have to be removed from society. Second, the definition of who’s dangerous expands, often coming to include political opponents and rivals.\n\n“If the government can arrest civilians with no criminal record and put them on planes out of the country without accounting for who they are or for any actual legal process — as has been happening in recent weeks — what would stop them from deporting whomever they like?” Pitzer continued. “Or from saying they had deported detainees while actually disappearing people to black sites internally? If the courts can’t enforce due process and find out who’s being detained, where they are now and what’s happening to them, then we’re all vulnerable.”\n\nWhen Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi who went on an anti-immigrant killing spree in 2011, posted his murderous manifesto, it included a quotation, often attributed to Napoleon, that imagined an all-powerful leader, free to do whatever he pleased. Last month Trump posted the same quote on X.\n\n“He who saves his Country violates no Law,” it said.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Nearly lost in last week’s wall-to-wall coverage of the Signal group chat security lapse was the role of a different kind of app, one at least as popular as Signal, in further revealing the flawed security protocols among some of the same, most highly targeted officials in our government. Reports showed that the Venmo accounts of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz, among others, were left public, revealing the officials’ personal contacts on the app.\n\nAllowing your friends list to be public, let alone your actual transactions, makes it easier for adversaries to target you.\n\nThe digital payment application Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, is the third-ranked payment system among the 60% of Americans who use such apps to pay for purchases. Instead of pulling out our credit cards, over half of us pull out our phones, at least twice a week, and use a digital payment app. So do several of the senior participants in the Signal group chat involving the U.S. plan to attack Houthis in Yemen, apparently. But unlike the average person, the way they use it poses critical security risks and questions.\n\nFollowing the Signal chat discovery, in addition to Hegseth and Waltz, the accounts of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; Dan Katz, chief of staff at the Treasury Department; Joe Kent, chief of staff at the State Department; and Brian McCormack, a senior National Security Council staffer, were also revealed to be set to public. Last July, Wired magazine confirmed that Vice President JD Vance let his Venmo contact list default to public. Among his contacts were wealthy individuals who seem to qualify as the “elite” that Vance claims to disdain, and some of the authors of Project 2025. Vance didn’t comment on the Wired reporting at the time. Waltz and Wiles made their accounts private after they were contacted by Wired for comment last week. The Pentagon hasn’t commented on Hegseth’s Venmo account.\n\nVenmo automatically adds your friends and contacts directly from your phone. This makes it easier to send a payment to someone you know or regularly do business with. Hegseth, or someone with access to his account, didn’t opt out of that feature. Another feature makes your contact list publicly viewable. Hegseth’s account allowed that, too, although it doesn’t mean his payment transactions were public (though in Venmo’s early days they would be). But McCormack’s transactions appear to have been public, as were Katz’s — which is why we know that Katz made a payment in 2018 accompanied solely by an eggplant emoji.\n\nVenmo is different than many payment apps because of its dual social and financial nature and because it makes you take action to avoid having your contacts and transactions default to public. Venmo’s early strategy was to build trust and confidence with users by capitalizing on the comfort level of transacting business with friends, by importing users’ social media and phone contacts. You signed up for Venmo through your existing Facebook account. And, by making payment transactions public, and including a note feature to maybe show your buddies that you bought pizza for everyone, Venmo became a social media-like display of what your shopping, dining and partying looked like last weekend.\n\nIt was only after researchers found then-President Joe Biden’s public Venmo contacts (it took them 10 minutes) in 2021 that Venmo added the ability to make contact lists private. You can also now shield your transactions from public view.\n\nEspecially if you hold a high-security position, allowing your friends list to be public, let alone your actual transactions, makes it easier for adversaries to target you. It need not be a foreign intelligence service pursuing you for this to work. It doesn’t require much sophistication. Criminal organizations and solo hackers, armed with your contacts, can send you a spear phishing message using the recognizable email address or phone number of a friend and unleash malware into your device, including ransomware. Hackers can spend thousands of hours trying to find a phone number, email or name of a contact their target might accept a message from, click on an attachment in that message and become a victim. But hackers wouldn’t need to spend hours targeting these officials. Not with public contact and transaction lists.\n\nA foreign intelligence service could wreak even more havoc. Their abilities include being able to entice you to click on an attachment, presumably sent by a friend, and install a beacon virus that receives hacker commands. They can covertly install logging software that documents every keystroke you enter while on your device. Maybe even the words you type in a sensitive group chat with colleagues.\n\nSuch data can also be a treasure trove for journalists and watchdog groups searching for conflicts of interest or professional biases.\n\nSuch data can also be a treasure trove for journalists and watchdog groups searching for conflicts of interest or professional biases. Hegseth’s contacts, for example, contain myriad wealthy individuals in the Silicon Valley tech industry, including Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal, as well as other CEOs who have large DOD contracts. Also listed were senior executives in health care. That might interest pundits wondering if the VA is already headed to privatizing veterans’ medical care.\n\nIf you are among Venmo’s millions of users, you may wonder about how to make your account safer. Thankfully, Venmo now offers options, and there are “how to” instructions across the internet, including one from The Washington Post.\n\nThe Signal group chat scandal and the Venmo accounts revelations aren’t isolated incidents. They reflect either a shocking lack of security awareness among many Trump Cabinet officials, or a reckless disregard for national security — or possibly both. Senior intelligence community leaders don’t need to be cybersecurity experts to protect their personal and professional lives from penetration. Each of their departments should have technical experts who can harden their bosses’ digital security immediately upon reporting for duty. Why that hasn’t happened should be the subject of congressional inquiry.\n\nIn a statement given to Wired in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, a Venmo spokesperson said: “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists — and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.”\n\nIncredibly simple for us? Maybe. Incredibly simple for members of the Trump administration? Apparently not.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The talk of Major League Baseball’s opening weekend was the New York Yankees’ bats, and \"bats\" here isn't a figurative way to talk about the insane 36 runs off 34 hits, including 15 homers, the team notched in their first three games. Instead, the conversation is focused on the literal shape of the bats some on the Yankees used to produce those eye-popping numbers.\n\nThe conversation is focused on the shape of the bats some on the Yankees used to produce those eye-popping numbers.\n\nThe Yanks seem to have created an edge by — gasp — innovating. Several of their stars (notably excluding Aaron Judge, who leads the team in hits, home runs, on-base percentage, RBIs and batting average) are swinging a so-called torpedo bat, which uses a manufacturing tweak to shift some of a traditional bat’s mass a few inches in toward the batter. Instead of the bats we’re used to seeing that are skinny on one end and heavy on the other, these bats look flatter because more of their mass is concentrated in the zone most likely to make contact with a pitch, theoretically giving hitters more power without changing anything else.\n\nEarly results say the Yankees’ scheme is working: They’re undefeated through three games, having outscored the Milwaukee Brewers 36-14 in their opening series.\n\nAnd now, the question being asked in the sports-talkosphere is “Are the Yankees cheating?” Is changing the shape of a baseball bat the same as corking one, which once earned Sammy Sosa a suspension? Does it line up with players’ using performance enhancing drugs, signal stealing or pitchers’ tampering with a ball?\n\nMLB’s rules, at least at this point, say no. Each team is responsible for supplying its own bats, and beyond restrictions governing diameter and length — a bat can be no more than 2.61 inches at its thickest part and no longer than 42 inches —teams appear to be free to tinker with the lumber. But until now, no team has — at least not to any great effect.\n\nIt may not technically be cheating, but it’s hard to view the Yankees’ subterfuge as consistent with baseball’s enduring — but no less phony — mythology as a game for purists in which even minor innovations risk sullying the game. This is the same sport that long after yielding the mantle of “America’s Pastime” to the NFL still refuses to approve the use of an electronic strike zone and greenlit instant replay only this millennium, the last of the big four American sports leagues to do so.\n\nIt’s the same sport that egregiously shuns Barry Bonds, the best player of his era and the king of sending balls out of the park, because he’s been suspected of having used performance-enhancing drugs, even though MLB looked the other way and raked in profits as Bonds’ home runs boosted ratings.\n\nThe Yankees, in particular, help drive baseball’s cornball myth-making. There’s a rich irony in a team that won’t put players’ last names on their jerseys and didn’t until this season allow those players to wear beards modifying their bats — even if legally. The Yankees are perhaps baseball’s poster child for propping up its aggressive nostalgia by resisting innocuous changes. But here they are, messing with the bat, of all things, to their advantage on the field.\n\nIs nothing sacred?\n\nApparently not. MIT-trained physicist Aaron Leanhardt, whom the Yankees hired for their coaching staff in 2022, reportedly created the torpedo bats. Leanhardt jumped to the Miami Marlins in the offseason, but not before his bats were put into use by the Yankees last year. The Yankees aren’t the only ones. Players with the Cincinnati Reds, the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox, the Toronto Blue Jays, the Baltimore Orioles and the Tampa Bay Rays have reportedly either used the bats in game or tried them out.\n\nAs long as MLB holds that torpedo bats are all good, every team has an incentive to use them. That wouldn’t be the worst thing for a sport with a shrinking audience.\n\nSo, what should baseball do? As long as MLB holds that torpedo bats are all good by the rulebook, every team has an incentive to use them. That wouldn’t be the worst thing for a sport with a shrinking audience that all but guarantees that small market teams struggle to field competitive rosters. The Pittsburgh Pirates, for example, have the most exciting young pitcher in the sport in ace Paul Skenes, but their paltry $88 million payroll is less than a third of the Yankees’ $288.1 million in salaries this season, according to Spotrac.\n\nWith Judge and the rest of the pinstripes visiting PNC Park this weekend, why shouldn’t the Pirates try to even the odds with some torpedoes of their own?\n\nIf baseball ever hopes to reclaim its share of fans’ imaginations, it just might want to look the other way on this one, too.",

        "content": "Trailing $1 million checks, Elon Musk descended on Wisconsin on Sunday night as part of his final bid to buy Tuesday’s state Supreme Court race and solidify his positions as MAGA’s enforcer and kingmaker.\n\nDespite his almost nonexistent relationship with the Badger State, Musk has put himself at the center of the campaign that will determine control of the state’s high court — dumping in at least $20 million, according to The Associated Press, to elect a Trump-friendly candidate — making it the most expensive judicial campaign in American history. Despite warnings that it might be illegal, Musk handed out two checks for $1 million each to voters who had signed his petition against activist judges. (State courts had turned down efforts by the state’s Democratic attorney general to block the handouts.)\n\nDespite his almost nonexistent relationship with the Badger State, Musk has put himself at the center of the campaign that will determine control of the state’s high court.\n\nFor Wisconsin, the stakes are monumental: A win by conservative Brad Schimel over liberal Susan Crawford would flip control of the seven-member court, which now has a 4-3 liberal majority, with consequences for the fate of abortion rights, as well as redistricting.\n\nBut the vote is also important for Musk, who has effectively made the contest a referendum on himself and his DOGE crusade.\n\nSunday night, during an elaborately choreographed rally in Green Bay, the world’s richest man cast the Wisconsin vote in near-apocalyptic terms. The outcome will determine who “steers the course of Western civilization,” he declared. “I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”\n\nVictory in this crucial swing state would be wind beneath Musk’s wings. Republicans would read it as an endorsement of DOGE, and it would quiet growing GOP anxiety about the unpopularity of that agenda. For Musk, it would be definitive evidence of his political clout.\n\nDefeat, on the other hand, would be seen as a humiliating setback for both Musk and President Donald Trump.\n\nUnderstanding the stakes, Musk has flooded Wisconsin with cash and paid volunteers who are knocking on doors and trying to persuade low-propensity Trump voters to turn out Tuesday for Schimel. He’s all-in — and he has taken Trump with him. (Trump has endorsed Schimel but not campaigned here on his behalf.)\n\nEven though the race is technically nonpartisan and judges are supposed to be apolitical and independent, almost every piece of literature supporting Schimel features pictures of Trump. One flyer by a Musk-backed Super PAC declares: “Conservative Brad Schimel will support President Trump’s agenda!”\n\nAs part of their effort, a Musk-backed group has also posted fake pro-Susan Crawford ads implying she’s a woke progressive.\n\nIn turn, Democrats have made Musk’s attempt to buy the election a centerpiece of their campaign — accusing Schimel of selling himself to the billionaire. They have also pointed to Schimel’s devotion to the Republican president. Schimel — a judge in Waukesha County — told a group of Turning Point USA activists last month that Trump needed “a support network around him.”\n\nEarly voting has already set records, and because this is Wisconsin, the race is likely to be close.\n\n“They filed over 70 lawsuits against him since he took the oath of office barely a month ago, over 70 lawsuits to try to stop almost every single thing he’s doing because they don’t want him to get a win,” Schimel told the group. “They’re so desperate for him to not get a win that they won’t let America have a win. That’s what they’re doing. The only way we’re going to stop that is if the courts stop it. That’s the only place to stop this lawfare.”\n\nEarly voting has already set records, and because this is Wisconsin, the race is likely to be close. A poll by Marquette’s Law School in early March found that many voters were unfamiliar with the actual candidates. But the same poll found deep skepticism over the scope and speed of the DOGE spending cuts. And while Trump’s approval rating was 48% favorable to 51% unfavorable, Musk himself was further underwater.

        "content": "When Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza on March 18, Amna Asfour, a 36-year-old mother of four in Khan Younis, was jolted awake by a deafening explosion. “My son clung to my arm and whispered, ‘Mama, is it starting again?’” she recounted. During the brief pause in attacks following the January ceasefire, she had dared to hope that her children might sleep without fear. But reality set in quickly that night. “I tell them again: Sleep in your shoes. Keep your bag by the door, though I don’t know where else to go after we’ve already fled four times.”\n\nIn Gaza, the expectation of devastation is as constant as breathing.\n\nFor 15 months, Palestinians in Gaza have endured relentless bombardment, starvation and displacement. When a ceasefire finally arrived on Jan. 19, it merely offered a brief, fragile pause to bury the dead, tend to the wounded, and cling to the remnants of life before it was disrupted. In Gaza, the expectation of devastation is as constant as breathing.\n\nI covered the first phase of this war from the ground before I fled Gaza for my family’s and my safety. Now, reporting from Cairo as airstrikes continue to fall with unimaginable intensity, I see that for those still on the ground, there is no safety or calm, only the certainty that every lull is merely the prelude to even more destruction.\n\nEven with reports of a new ceasefire deal on the horizon, this latest return of airstrikes has felt more like a confirmation that no pause will ever lead to lasting peace. And the deepening psychological toll — a burden that now rests on the ashes of over a year of agony and terror — means the fear of death or injury has become secondary to the slow erosion of hope.\n\nBy the weekend, more than 750 people had been killed — most of them women and children — while hundreds more were wounded. After Israel broke the ceasefire, health officials reported the death toll in Gaza since the war began in October 2023 surpassed 50,000.\n\nFor Palestinian journalists, reporting on this war is both a professional duty and an act of survival.\n\nOn March 24, the IDF killed two more Palestinian journalists: Al Jazeera Mubasher correspondent Hossam Shabat and Palestine Today reporter Mohammed Mansour. Shabat was killed when his car was targeted in Beit Lahiya, while Mansour died in a bombing that struck his apartment in Khan Younis. The IDF confirmed both killings, claiming both journalists were terrorists. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the deaths and denied that claim, a spokesperson stating, “The deliberate and targeted killing of a journalist, of a civilian, is a war crime.” Al Jazeera had denied earlier claims that Shabat was a terrorist.\n\nTheir deaths add to the staggering toll of journalists and media workers killed in the war — more than 200 since October 2023, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate — as those who remain continue risking their lives to document the unfolding devastation.\n\nThe targeting of media workers in Gaza has been routine. Press vehicles, clearly marked as such, have been struck by Israeli forces, and shelters housing displaced civilians and journalists have not been spared. We’ve seen numerous reports of journalists being personally targeted and threatened by the Israeli military.\n\nDespite these relentless attacks, journalists in Gaza continue to do their job. Abdelhakim Abu Riash, a freelance photojournalist in northern Gaza, says he is “running out of places to report from — and of colleagues to report with.” But stopping isn’t an option, he says, “because then there would be no one to tell the world what’s happening.”\n\nSulaiman Hijjy, another photojournalist who has been reporting from Gaza, has grown accustomed to this grim reality. Since the airstrikes resumed less than two weeks ago, he found himself reliving the earliest days of the conflict. “For 15 months, I have filmed mass graves, bombed-out neighborhoods, entire families erased in a single airstrike,” he recalled.\n\nA freelance photojournalist in northern Gaza says he is ‘running out of places to report from — and of colleagues to report with.’\n\n“When the ceasefire came, I thought maybe I could breathe.” But there was no relief. Now, Hijjy files stories between airstrikes, capturing what remains of lives and landscapes before they, too, are erased.\n\nThe names of our fallen colleagues like Hossam, Mohammed and so many others before them should be voices that echo in newsrooms, not carved into gravestones.\n\nEven reporting from Cairo, the images of death don’t haunt me as a distant horror; they are a daily reality for me and thousands who remain in Gaza. They remind me that even as I report, I am also mourning. Documenting all of this means standing at the edge of life and loss, and continuing to write even when the world reads our words yet refuses to act. Carrying out this work is to ask, time and again, whether anything we say will ever be enough to break the world’s indifference.\n\nJournalists aren’t the only ones fighting for life and dignity in Gaza. Dr. Yasser Shami, a surgeon at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, described the nearly impossible conditions of providing care in a hospital stripped of resources. “For two months, we tried to prepare,” he recalled. “We had no real supplies, but at least patients weren’t pouring in every minute.”\n\nThe current situation in his hospital’s emergency room is even “worse than before,” he says. He recently had to amputate a 9-year-old boy’s leg with no anesthesia. He says the “little boy screamed until he passed out,” before he moved on to the next patient. “I don’t think we’re even allowed the time to grieve here,” he said.\n\nEach day, Shami faces impossible choices: who receives the last dose of antibiotics, who gets the only available ventilator, who might have a chance with urgent care, and who is already beyond saving. There is no proper triage — only a cruel calculus of survival dictated by scarcity.\n\nAccording to a United Nations report from last December, 136 Israeli strikes on hospitals in Gaza pushed the health care system to the brink of collapse. This dismantling of Gaza’s health infrastructure means that even those who survive the bombs may not survive their wounds.\n\nMedics, surgeons and journalists alike continue to press on, despite ongoing bombardments and the dimming prospect of lasting peace.\n\nEvery day, those journalists who have managed somehow to survive pick up their cameras, notebooks and microphones, even when they know they could be next.​ We grieve for those we’ve lost, yet we dare not stop — we owe it to them to keep telling the stories of those who can no longer speak for themselves.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring a researcher to study the widely debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. And that person is reportedly one of the chief disseminators of misinformation about a purported link between vaccines and autism in America.\n\nWith this hire, anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Health and Human Services Department is dealing a blow both to public faith in vaccine safety and to the credibility of the federal government’s public health guidance, by turning what should be a technical, evidence-based institution into overtly political terrain.\n\nI cannot be certain what David Geier will find in this dubious study, but his track record is about as damning as it gets.\n\nNBC News, citing two sources familiar with the plan, reports that the CDC is expected to hand over multiple sets of vaccine safety data to a “senior data analyst” at HHS named David Geier. NBC News reports that Geier and his father, Mark Geier, are “researchers known for their poorly designed and retracted studies using government safety data that have long fueled widespread misinformation about vaccines.” Among other things, the father-son duo claimed at an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004 that CDC data showed vaccines were linked to autism — and the claim was “refuted by scientists at the meeting and in scores of published studies since,” NBC reported. NBC News said that neither HHS nor Geier responded to requests for comment.\n\nThough Mark Geier has testified in scores of court cases involving vaccines, his testimony has consistently been rejected as irrelevant in legal settings. According to The New York Times, in 2003 a judge ruled that Geier was “a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience.” Other judges have called Geier’s testimony “intellectually dishonest” and “wholly unqualified,” The Times reported.\n\nBoth Geiers have records of unethical behavior. Per NBC News, they have “promoted an unproven treatment for autism that cost families tens of thousands of dollars and included injections of Lupron,” and “diagnosed kids with precocious puberty without proper tests and misled parents into thinking they were signing up for an approved autism therapy.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the Maryland Board of Physicians suspended Mark Geier's medical license in 2011 “because he was treating autistic children with a drug considered dangerous for young people and not known to alleviate symptoms of the disorder,” and revoked it altogether the next year, saying \"he had misrepresented his credentials.\" And David Geier — who has no medical degree — was sanctioned for practicing medicine without a license by the Maryland Board of Physicians.\n\nI cannot be certain what David Geier will find in this dubious study, but his track record is about as damning as it gets. If I were Kennedy and I wanted to convince the country that — despite the massive record of debunking — there is still more research to be conducted on a possible link between vaccines and autism, I would hire someone with impeccable credentials, and not someone who has been tarred by a record of practicing without credentials and retracted studies.\n\nBut choosing Geier gives away the game: Kennedy wants someone who will confirm his priors and, should Geier make a new set of claims about vaccines causing autism, will give them the imprimatur of the CDC.\n\nThis is a harrowing development for public health in America. The commissioning of the study alone is enough to once again put this theory in the news and intensify increasing vaccine hesitancy — which is already having serious consequences. Should Geier use this opportunity to peddle more misinformation, that will be even worse, and it’s reasonable to expect it could intensify vaccine hesitancy even further.\n\nThere’s another longer-term cost here, which is that the CDC will be seen as yet another arena for politicians to exploit to score points or push fringe ideas unsupported by evidence. The CDC is not infallible — consider the way it handled masking guidance during the first weeks of the Covid pandemic. But the CDC has corrected itself and generally held itself to high standards for evidence and rigor in scientific inquiry. Hiring noncredible anti-vaxxers should be seen as an attack on those principles — and Americans’ health.",

        "title": "Despite the Constitution, Trump says he’s ‘not joking’ about eyeing a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Over the course of the last decade or so, Donald Trump has demonstrated an affinity for laying rhetorical groundwork for some of his most radical tactics. Ahead of the 2020 election, for example, the president prepared to reject a possible defeat, so he spent months telling the public that the electoral process was illegitimate. Ahead of his many criminal indictments, he similarly invested time and energy into delegitimizing the legal process.\n\nThis strategy came to mind anew upon hearing the Republican talk about possibly pursuing a third term in the White House. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is prohibited by the Constitution under the 22nd Amendment, saying in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarifying that he was “not joking.” ... “A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a Sunday-morning phone call with NBC News, referring to his allies.\n\nTo be sure, the president’s comments on the subject came with some caveats — or at least comments that seemed like caveats. Trump said, for example, that it’s “far too early” to make any decisions about his electoral future. He similarly added that it’s “very early” in his second term.\n\nBut those comments didn’t negate the apparent fact that the incumbent, who is prohibited under the U.S. Constitution from seeking a third term — the 22nd Amendment says, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice” — is open to the possibility of at least trying to pursue a third term.\n\nIn fact, in his interview with NBC News, Trump was hardly subtle. “I’m not joking,” he said, adding that there are “methods” in which he could pursue such a goal.\n\nNBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nHours after the NBC News report reached the public, the president chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One and dodged a series of questions on the topic, though he claimed that “people” have asked him to run for a third term — which he said would be a fourth term “in a way” because his 2020 race was “totally rigged.” (It was not rigged; he lost fair and square, and he’s been lying uncontrollably about this for more than four years.)\n\nIf this broader rhetorical push sounds at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. Trump talked about pursuing a third term earlier this month. And last month. And the month before that. And the month before that. In fact, as regular readers might recall, Trump made a series of public comments about a third term during his first term.\n\nWhat’s more, a variety of White House allies, most notably media personality Steve Bannon, appear to be quite enthusiastic about what they perceive as a possibility — which, again, is not a possibility.\n\nI won’t pretend to know where this is headed or the degree to which the president is prepared to defy constitutional law. But Scott Cummings, a professor of legal ethics at the UCLA School of Law, made a comment on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on Friday that stood out for me.\n\nCommenting on autocracies around the world that have consolidated power, Cummings noted that in none of these countries “do leaders do all the things that Trump is doing, take aim at all of these independent institutions, and then just walk away.” Rather, the professor added, authoritarians take these steps because they intend “to stay in power permanently.”",

        "title": "As allegations against Hegseth mount, the Pentagon chief faces a new kind of problem",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Pete Hegseth’s tenure as the secretary of defense was already a disaster before the Signal chat scandal broke last week, but the revelations from the controversy generated a great many calls from Capitol Hill for the Pentagon chief’s resignation.\n\nAs last week neared its end, however, things managed to go from bad to worse for the scandal-plagued former Fox News personality.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Friday, for example, that Hegseth tapped his younger brother, Phil Hegseth, to serve as senior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and liaison officer to the Defense Department — a title that has meant, among other things, a trip to Guantanamo Bay and traveling on the Pentagon’s 747 aircraft as the Cabinet secretary makes his first trip to the Indo-Pacific. The AP’s report added:\n\nIt’s common for the Defense Department and other federal agencies to have liaisons. Each military branch sends liaisons to Capitol Hill. The Pentagon, State Department and others all use interagency liaisons to more closely coordinate and keep tabs on policy. But it is not common for those senior-level positions to be filled by family members of the Cabinet heads....\n\nDespite Hegseth’s apparent preoccupation with merit-based employment decisions, his younger brother received a position of influence at the Pentagon despite a background as the founder of a podcast production company.\n\nAround the same time, The Wall Street Journal published another report about the defense secretary that raised eyebrows:\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is facing scrutiny over his handling of details of a military strike, brought his wife, a former Fox News producer, to two meetings with foreign military counterparts where sensitive information was discussed, according to multiple people who were present or had knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe Journal’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that a Defense secretary “can invite anyone to meetings with visiting counterparts, but attendee lists are usually carefully limited to those who need to be there and attendees are typically expected to possess security clearances given the delicate nature of the discussions.”\n\nHegseth’s latest wife doesn’t work for the Pentagon and there’s no public reporting about her having a high-ranking security clearance. (Hegseth’s spokesperson was offered a chance to respond to the reporting, but he declined, saying that he believed the report would include “inaccuracies” that he did not identify.)\n\nThe reporting from the AP and the Journal dovetailed with a Politico report that said while Donald Trump has expressed public support for Hegseth, “behind the scenes, administration insiders are starting to express doubts about the Pentagon chief’s judgment.” CNN had a related piece that said, “Interviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth’s leadership at the Pentagon.”\n\nTaken individually, the revelations about his brother’s job and his wife’s access are certainly important in their own right. But let’s not overlook the story behind the stories: It appears increasingly obvious that there are some people at the Pentagon who’ve learned some unfortunate things about Hegseth, and they’re suddenly eager to share that information with journalists.\n\nOr put another way, two months into Hegseth’s tenure, he’s generating the kind of chatter that his respected and qualified predecessor didn’t have to worry about at the department he ostensibly leads.\n\nIt’s a problem for the Pentagon chief that there’s evidence of his incompetence, abuses and failures, but it’s just as notable a problem that there are DOD insiders who are apparently willing to talk to reporters about his incompetence, abuses and failures.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s administration recently stripped Columbia University of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding in a blatant act of authoritarianism that Trump and his allies dubiously say is necessary to stem antisemitism. The university sheepishly acquiesced to virtually all of the administration’s demands in an effort to restart talks to unfreeze that money.\n\nI recently wrote about the absurdity of the MAGA movement’s lobbing claims of antisemitism precisely as some of the most prominent conservative influencers are praising Nazi apologists and even defending Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nThe Trump administration has given a range of rationales — from diversity-related policies to the recognition of trans people in collegiate athletics — as it targets American universities, which JD Vance once branded “the enemy.” Beyond that, the White House has used allegations of antisemitism to pursue deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nAmid all of this, I’ve been interested in hearing Jewish voices speaking about the administration’s apparent use of Jewish people and their pain to carry out its illiberal goals — and the concerns they have about the White House’s actions helping fuel antisemitism.\n\nJason Stanley, a philosophy professor who recently decided to leave Yale to go teach in Canada, recently explained on PBS’ “Amanpour & Company” why he thinks the Trump administration’s efforts are actually boosting antisemitic tropes:\n\nThis is reinforcing antisemitic tropes all across the political spectrum. ... What are the most toxic antisemitic tropes? Well, “Jews control the institutions.” This is absolutely reinforcing this. Any young American is going to think: Remember what happened when they took down the world’s greatest university system on behalf of Jewish safety? And this will go down in history books — the history of this era will say that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism. So if we don’t speak out, if we American Jews do not speak out against this, this will be a grim chapter in our history as Americans. It’s the first time in my life as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans — not because of the protests on campus, which, as I said, had a lot of Jewish students in them. But because we are suddenly at the center of U.S. politics. It’s never good to be in the crosshairs for us. And we are being used to destroy democracy.\n\nDylan Williams, the vice president for government affairs at the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank, agreed.\n\n“This is exactly right and I have no doubt that it is how the overwhelming majority of Jewish Americans feel — we are being exploited in an attack on democracy, rights and the rule of law,” Williams wrote on X.\n\nThis concern isn’t confined to Jewish leftists. In fact, conservative writer Nick Cohen essentially warned about what we’re seeing now back in December. In an article for The Jewish Chronicle headlined “American Jews, beware of being used by Trump,” he wrote:\n\nThere’s an old saying that antisemitism is never really about Jews. Everyone from European fascists to today’s Khomeinists, for example, uses anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to justify the denial of human rights to their own citizens. The same applies to the philosemitism of the Trump movement. It wants to use American Jews — most of whom still vote Democrat, I should add — as an excuse to undermine their political opponents in liberal universities and abolish the US Education department.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Stern, the director of Bard College’s Center for the Study of Hate and a lead drafter of the working definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, recently told NPR that the Trump administration’s campus crackdown risks scapegoating Jewish students, as well.\n\n“It puts pro-Israel Jewish students in a situation where they may be seen as trying to suppress speech rather than answer it,” Stern said.\n\nAs NPR noted, the administration has adopted Stern’s definition of antisemitism in its executive orders — but he says the definition is being distorted and weaponized.\n\nThese concerns, about purported allyship’s being used in ways that ultimately may undermine Jews, mirror what some Asian Americans expressed as conservatives were using their communities to argue against — and do away with — race-conscious admissions on college campuses.\n\nNeedless to say, members of more than one marginalized group have shown wariness about the MAGA movement’s claiming to act on their behalf. And they have ample reason to feel that way.",

        "content": "By all appearances, when the White House dispatched an uninvited delegation to Greenland, the move was intended to be a charm offensive of sorts. Vice President JD Vance, his wife and his colleagues hoped their visit to the island — which Donald Trump is apparently determined to acquire — would make a good opening impression with locals.\n\nIf that was the goal, the administration failed quite spectacularly. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, officials in Greenland made a series of efforts to make clear that they did not want the U.S. delegation to be there, and as part of his visit, Vance took the opportunity to publicly and needlessly admonish Denmark — a reliable NATO ally for many years.\n\nThe Republican, as part of a press conference at a U.S. military base, added, “The president has said clearly he doesn’t think military force is going to be necessary, but he absolutely believes Greenland is an important part of the security, not just of the United States, but of the world and, of course, the people of Greenland, too.”\n\nThe word “but” did a lot of work in that sentence.\n\nThe circumstances were, by any fair measure, ridiculous. The American vice president took a sojourn to an island without an invitation, held a press conference on foreign soil, suggested the United States would acquire the island that does not wish to be acquired, and slammed a trusted ally that has done nothing wrong.\n\nA day later, his boss made matters worse with some fresh comments to NBC News.\n\nThe president on Saturday also said he has “absolutely” had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory. “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” Trump said. He added that there’s a “good possibility that we could do it without military force” but that “I don’t take anything off the table.”\n\nNote, it was a couple of weeks ago when Trump, while seated alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, predicted that he will ultimately succeed in his quest to take control of Greenland. “I think it’ll happen,” the president said when he asked what his vision is for the potential annexation of the island.\n\nAs part of the same set of comments, the American president also suggested that he might deploy additional U.S. troops to Greenland.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Republican White House had an opportunity to categorically reject the idea of using military force against an ally as part of Trump’s territorial ambitions. That clearly did not happen.\n\nA day after Trump effectively guaranteed that the United States would acquire Greenland, the island’s new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said via social media, “President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland.’ Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.”\n\nThe charm offensive, in other words, is off to a rough start.\n\nOf course, Trump’s idea isn’t just unpopular abroad, it’s unpopular in his own country, too: The latest Fox News poll asked respondents about various parts of the president’s agenda, and the least popular idea was taking over Greenland, with 70% of Americans opposed to the president’s plan.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "How Vance's comments in the Signal scandal undermine Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn’t think such an aggressive move was a good idea — at least not now. The vice president’s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be “a mistake.”\n\nAmong other things, he didn’t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn’t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg — an outrageous breach of national security protocols — the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump’s inner circle’s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump’s pledge to be president of “peace” and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn’t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity — and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of “America First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn’t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, “This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.” And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.”\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of “bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replies, “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world’s police officer. They’re saying this isn’t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn’t about the U.S.’s own economic interests. Rather, it’s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.’s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way “to send a message” about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative — both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until “Israeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel’s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza — with Trump's blessing — the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn’t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it’s unclear when they’ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. “The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n“Excellent,” Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it “recorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.” And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors “less reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.” All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. “The group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,” Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there’s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump’s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we’re coming to see in Trump’s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump’s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They’ve laughed at the misspelling of “principals” in the group chat, and derided those officials’ hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn’t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump’s inner circle sees the United States’ role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East.",

        "content": "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, Donald Trump Jr., rapper 50 Cent and other MAGA-aligned figures suffered a big loss Saturday when voters in the Bayou State rejected various amendments to the state constitution.\n\nLandry spent a large amount of political capital advocating for the four proposed amendments. Amendment 1 would have allowed the state to create regional and statewide specialty courts and would’ve granted the state Supreme Court the power to punish out-of-state lawyers accused of unethical behavior in Louisiana.\n\nAmendment 2 would have lowered the state’s maximum income tax rate, among other things. Perhaps most importantly, it would have “moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily,” the Louisiana Illuminator reported.\n\n50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had received some backlash for dropping a video endorsing the amendment.\n\n50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had received some backlash for dropping a video endorsing the amendment. The rapper-turned-businessman recently has been executing a plan to build a massive production studio in Shreveport.

And rather than take his loss gracefully, Louisiana’s governor chose to cast conspiratorial blame at liberal donor George Soros.\n\n“Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,” he said in a statement, adding: “We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a State that is conditioned for failure.”\n\nThat’s obvious sour grapes from Landry, who seems more than a little upset that this MAGA-fueled power grab failed at the polls.",

        "title": "Why Trump can't run for a third presidential term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” when he told NBC News on Sunday that his allies have been pushing him to run for a third term — but added that “it is far too early to think about it.” I disagree: It is not at all too early to think about whether and how a president who attempted to throw out an election loss to retain power wrongly attempts to stay in power into 2029 and beyond.\n\nThough Trump’s team routinely homes in on ambiguities in the law to find loopholes that let them run roughshod over our political norms, he’ll find that there’s no ambiguity in the 22nd Amendment, possibly the clearest limit on the presidency the Constitution imposes.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” it reads, “and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThere’s no foothold for any alternative reading of the language, and Trump’s usual wheedling and plotting to get around any limitations on him should instantly fall flat, far before it ever reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, again, the language of the 14th Amendment is very clear about banning insurrectionists from holding federal office. But when the Colorado Supreme Court cited that prohibition and ruled that Trump’s Jan. 6-related activities made him ineligible for that state’s ballot, the conservative U.S. Supreme Court helped Trump get around that constitutional roadblock.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued that three key phrases — “having previously taken an oath,” “as an officer of the United States” and “engaged in insurrection” — didn’t apply to Trump. They combined ahistorical arguments with bad faith readings of the text, and specific word choice was interrogated to within an inch of its life. The court’s opinion in Trump v. Anderson — issued unanimously — sidestepped his lawyer’s outlandish readings of the text and found that while states can use Section 3 to block state or local office-seekers from the ballot, they can’t block a federal candidate.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be much room for Trump to find a similar weak point in the 22nd Amendment, even if he demands that the Justice Department — which now includes several of the lawyers who helped keep him on the ballot last year — find a way for him to run again.\n\nUnlike the 14th Amendment, which was drafted over 100 years ago, the 22nd Amendment was written and ratified within some Americans’ living memory. There’s no mystery about what prompted its addition to the Constitution. In response to the outbreak of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to shatter the norm of U.S. presidents’ serving only two terms and ran for and won a third term. He then won a fourth presidential election in 1944, which shifted the politics of the issue dramatically.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law.\n\nCongressional Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats feared Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term stretch could start a trend. Even though World War II was fresh in their minds, they made no exception that allowed for a two-term president to run again if the country is at war. Notably, they also limited the number of times a vice president who assumed the presidency could run again.\n\nIf anything, the 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law. But despite the law’s being unequivocal, Trump told NBC News there “are methods which you could” use to seek a third term. He agreed that a hypothetical put before him would count, one in which he and Vice President JD Vance swap places on the ticket before Vance hands him back the top job.\n\nIn that, he seems to be taking inspiration from Russian President Vladimir Putin. After two terms, and barred from a third consecutive run, Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 2008, allowing Dmitry Medvedev to assume the presidency. Putin quickly changed his mind, swapping jobs back with Medvedev in 2012, and has remained president ever since.\n\nWhile I stand by my belief that Trump should have been disqualified from running again under the 14th Amendment, I can grudgingly admit that there were enough novel questions involved that Trump’s lawyers were able to craft a whole new subgenre of historical fiction in answering them. There is no such room for imagination in any case in which there’s even a possibility of Trump’s overstaying his term in office. The text of the 22nd Amendment is clearer than any past constitutional challenge he has instigated. And every judge he encounters is duty-bound to tell him so.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The sweet smell of baked sugar and butter filled my kitchen nearly every afternoon that spring of 2019. My son was in middle school and upping his cupcake game. He had perfected an Instagram-worthy icing method, in which he piped a channel of every color of the rainbow onto plastic wrap, then rolled it together and squeezed out a swirl of rainbow icing in a small mountain on top of perfectly baked cake. Then he planted a small flag with a friendly message about trans kids. His idea was to hand out cupcakes for Trans Day of Visibility. “I want to raise awareness, Mom,” he said. “I want people to know trans kids are just working on being themselves.”\n\n‘I want to raise awareness, Mom,’ he said. ‘I want people to know trans kids are just working on being themselves.’\n\nOn this Trans Day of Visibility, it’s jarring for me to recall how the same day felt then.\n\nThat year, in California, the ACLU was fighting on behalf of a trans man who’d been denied gender affirming surgery at a Catholic hospital on the day his procedure had been scheduled. I learned then that the hospital closest to my son’s school was run by a Catholic company.\n\nRaising my kids in a cozy Northern California town, I’d done my best to teach all of them how to treat others with respect, how to reach out to friends who were having a tough time on the playground, how to work with other kids with humor and lightness to help them see it wasn’t cool to pick on the weaker kids. They’d learned to have faith in kindness and learned that neighbors help one another live better lives. But I spent that cupcake spring wondering if I’d handed my trans kid a daisy for a gun fight.\n\nIn 2021, Arkansas became the first state to outlaw gender affirming care for minors. Now 26 states have. I expect most parents of trans kids feared Donald Trump being elected again and had a hunch about what to expect if he was, but the administration’s actions have been swifter and more concrete than we thought possible in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s executive orders opposing the participation of the trans community in American life are plainly rooted in bigotry and lies.\n\nMy son is in college now and doesn’t have much time for baking. He’s studying engineering and spent the last two weeks disassembling an antique typewriter to study the mechanics of joinery and levers. He’d like to someday work on a team that builds devices for people with mobility challenges. Some of the best companies doing this work are in other countries. To work abroad, or to even see what those companies are doing, he’ll need to use a passport.\n\nImagine the scene at the airport when a TSA official looks at the F on my son’s new passport and does a double take.\n\nFor years he’s had one that matches his identity. But when he renews it in a few months, because of an executive order Trump signed on this first day of this term, it will be returned from the State Department with the wrong gender marker. Imagine the scene at the airport when a TSA official looks at the F on my son’s new passport and does a double take. The flow of travelers through the line will stall. My son’s personal security will drift into precarity. What happens next, I’m not sure. What I do know is that no one, not one single person, will be better for this, and in fact many people — the security officials, delayed travelers and especially my son — will all be worse off.\n\nDespite the wintry chill felt by the trans community and many other communities targeted by Trump, spring is breaking through. Purple crocuses and buttercup-yellow daffodils punch skyward.\n\nMore than one friend has asked me how they can support my family, my son, the trans community on this Trans Day of Visibility. My suggestion is that we go back to the basics. I know I’m not the only mom in the United States who raised her kids to treat people with respect and to reach out to others who were struggling. I wasn’t the only mom who taught her kids that it’s not cool when bullies pick on those who are weaker. Even though I used to wonder if equipping my kids with kindness was leaving them unprepared for the fight against cruelty, it’s obvious to me now that simple kindness is a radical act, a powerfully subversive form of resistance.\n\nSo, on this Trans Day of Visibility, the job of allies is simple but not easy: be kind.\n\nOn this Trans Day of Visibility, the job of allies is simple but not easy: be kind.\n\nHere’s a place to start. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Keep an eye out for fellow travelers knowing their safety is partially in your hands. Check on friends and loved ones to see how they’re doing — knowing that many people are losing their health care coverage, their sense of belonging and their sense of safety. If you review passports at the airport or work as an administrator at the passport agency, hold on to your own convictions about what you think American citizenship is and should be. Do not be coerced into executing orders that require you to treat others in a way you would not want to be treated. Embrace the best of yourself.\n\nAnd make cupcakes.",

        "content": "A few weeks ago, Donald Trump’s Justice Department gutted the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, shrinking the unit that oversees prosecutions of public officials accused of corruption from dozens of employees to roughly six. A week earlier, the president’s DOJ also removed at least three top national security officials, gutting the National Security Division.\n\nOne day earlier, the president’s Justice Department also ousted lawyers managing its pardon work and bankruptcy litigation, as well as the official overseeing the Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles internal ethics investigations.\n\nDespite these steps, which helped destabilize federal law enforcement, Team Trump had not targeted career line prosecutors who oversee individual criminal cases — that is, until a few days ago. The New York Times reported:\n\nTwo longtime career prosecutors have been suddenly fired by the White House, in what current and former Justice Department officials called an unusual and alarming exercise of presidential power. In recent days, the prosecutors, in Los Angeles and Memphis, were dismissed abruptly, notified by a terse one-sentence email stating no reason for the move other than that it was on behalf of the president himself.\n\nAsked about the firings, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Times, “The White House, in coordination with the Department of Justice, has dismissed more than 50 U.S. attorneys and deputies in the past few weeks.”\n\nThat’s true, but it’s not something to brag about.\n\nJust so we’re all clear, when one presidential administration replaces another, it’s routine for a White House to replace U.S. attorneys with a new batch of prosecutors who oversee federal law enforcement offices. Barack Obama chose a slate of U.S. attorneys to replace George W. Bush’s prosecutors; Trump replaced Obama’s; Joe Biden replaced Trump’s; and so on.\n\nBut these new developments are qualitatively different. From the Times’ report:\n\nThe ousters reflected a more aggressive effort by the White House to reach deep inside U.S. attorney offices across the country in a stark departure from decades of practice. While it is commonplace and accepted for senior political appointees at the Justice Department to change from administration to administration, no department veteran could recall any similar removal of assistant U.S. attorneys.\n\nThe fired prosecutors, who were ousted without warning, were career officials with extensive experience. If there’s any evidence that the two lawyers, Adam Schleifer and Reagan Fondren, deserved to be ousted for cause, the White House and the Justice Department have kept that information to themselves.\n\nThat said, Schleifer was working on a case involving a Trump donor.\n\nLeavitt added, in response to questions about the firings, “The American people deserve a judicial branch full of honest arbiters of the law who want to protect democracy, not subvert it,” which might’ve made slightly more sense if federal prosecutors were part of the judicial branch, but they’re not. (Prosecutors are part of the executive branch.)\n\nIf you’re thinking that developments like these are likely to have a chilling effect, signaling to other career line prosecutors that the Republican White House is both watching and willing to take dramatic steps to rein in those who work in a U.S. attorney’s office, you’re not alone.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "“Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” a frightening executive order from President Donald Trump’s White House Thursday takes aim at the Smithsonian and threatens to pull federal funding for content that promotes “divisive, race-centered ideology.”\n\nThe threat to museums such as The National Museum of African-American History and Culture is real. But even more sinister is the administration’s rejection of race as a “social construct,” which is nothing short of an expression of a belief in racial purity and white supremacy.\n\nEven more sinister is the administration’s rejection of race as a “social construct.”\n\nOne of the things that has Trump angry is “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit at the American Art Museum that innovatively positions nearly 100 sculptures alongside statements about scientific racism. That’s the discredited belief that there are biologically distinct races of people, with some more superior than others. The exhibition examines how artists and art objects have assisted, reflected or challenged such racist thinking since the 18th century, but Trump, in his executive order expresses disappointment that the show “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.”\n\nHolding that race is not a biological reality is not a mere view. It’s a fact, and the rejection of that fact is a key component of white supremacist thinking. Trump’s executive order claims race-centered ideologies are detrimental to our shared culture but is silent on the fact that white supremacy, which his executive order promotes, has proved to be the greatest, most deadly identity politics of them all. See slavery. See the westward expansion of the United States and Manifest Destiny.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has tried to overhaul the way we understand American history. On the heels of the Black Lives Matters protests following George Floyd’s murder, Trump issued an executive order to create the 1776 Commission, a team of conservative politicians, activists, and pundits (none of them professional historians) to develop a “patriotic education” that rescued American history from identity-driven revision that emphasizes critical thinking over patriotism.\n\nThe “1776 Report” was meant as a repudiation of the influential New York Times’ “1619 Project” that reoriented America’s founding myths through the lens of the Transatlantic slave trade. One of Trump’s final acts in office was the official release of that “1776 Report,” and one of President Joe Biden’s first acts in office was to rescind it through his own executive order.\n\nLike the “1776 Report,” the current executive order targeting the Smithsonian is preoccupied with the nation’s founding. It charges Vice President JD Vance with undoing “false revisions” that have brought “negative light” to our founding principles and insists — falsely — that the U.S. has always been a vehicle for universal freedoms.\n\nLike the “1776 Report,” the current executive order targeting the Smithsonian is preoccupied with the nation’s founding.\n\nThe administration demands that the Smithsonian – a sprawling network of 21 museums, research centers, an arboretum and a zoo — reflect its version of national identity by the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in July 2026. The Smithsonian is not entirely funded by the federal government, but enough of its budget relies on congressional appropriations that it’s always been vulnerable to political whims.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that a backward-looking political movement that seeks to “make America great again” wants its version, and only its version, of the past on display at our country’s highly visible cultural institutions. While people have always disagreed over what happened in the past and how it impacts where we find ourselves today, the Smithsonian is an institution that has helped steer people away from mythologies.\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian opened in 2004, breaking new ground with its focus on the representation of national racial and ethnic minority experience. The NMAAHC finally opened in 2016 during the last months of President Barack Obama’s presidency, 13 years after president George W. Bush signed the legislation creating it. Though the late Rep. John Lewis introduced the bill to create the NMAAHC and Bush signed it into law, its existence should be credited to everyday people who pushed to see a truthful portrayal of themselves and their history in the nation’s highest institutions.\n\nBut this is not all that Trump has in mind when he mentions “restoring truth and sanity.” It’s about rolling back social progress. The administration singling out the NMAAHC — incorrectly suggesting that it frames nuclear families, hard work, and individualism as “aspects of White culture” — is itself bizarre, but its underlying biologically essentialist take on society is even more troubling. It mentions the Smithsonian’s upcoming American Women’s History Museum, criticizing it for including nonbinary and trans women in its displays, saying that the museum should not “recognize men as women in any respect,” such as “male athletes participating in women’s sports.” Not satisfied with preventing trans women from playing women’s sports, the Trump administration appears to want to erase these communities from sight or even memory.\n\nThe demand for more diverse and inclusive stories on the National Mall goes back generations.\n\nThe demand for more diverse and inclusive stories on the National Mall goes back generations and the fight won’t stop with this executive action. As long as there are monuments, memorials, and exhibitions claiming to represent the public, the public will push back against those it finds to be misleading and offensive. In response to Trump’s administration scrubbing government websites of what it terms DEI content, the American Historical Association has condemned that “federal censorship of American history.”\n\nThe question of “who owns history” has always been a political one mired in power struggles, and Thursday’s executive order reveals that the stakes of this struggle are greater than ever. This is not just about representations. It’s about knowledge itself and the use of the knowledge to justify inequality.\n\nThere’s a reason people in Trump's administration seem more bothered by the idea of equity than diversity or inclusion: They don’t seem to think we’re equal and they’re going after all content that suggests we are. They believe there is a natural order of human beings — a biologically rigid sytem of race — that puts them at the top. And they want to force our most celebrated historical institutions to back them up.",

        "content": "The headline on the NBC News report probably raised some eyebrows: “Trump says he’s ‘very angry’ and ‘pissed off’ at Putin during an NBC News interview.” The report explained that Donald Trump, responding to Russia’s Vladimir Putin’s latest criticisms of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, complained that the comments were “not going in the right location.”\n\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.\n\nIf the goal was to generate a great many headlines about Trump being “angry” with his ally in Moscow, the comments were a great success.\n\nBut some skepticism is in order.\n\nFor now, let’s not dwell on the fact that it’s hard to imagine the Trump feeling genuine outrage about Putin criticizing Zelenskyy given the frequency with which he has criticized Zelenskyy. Instead, let’s consider what the Republican president has done, rather than that he’s said.\n\nFor example, the American president first threatened to impose harsh new sanctions on Russia in late January, and then he did nothing. Trump made related threats earlier this month, and again, there was no follow-through. As the Republican repeats a similar line, it’s tough to imagine the Kremlin feeling especially anxious about the White House’s next move — especially amid reports that the U.S. administration isn’t overly eager to enforce existing sanctions on Russia.\n\nBut while the administration’s line on sanctions is important, let’s also not overlook what the White House has done since Trump returned to power to help the Putin regime.\n\nAnd did I mention that Senate Republicans, at Trump’s behest, confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s director of national intelligence, despite her habit of echoing Russian propaganda? Because that happened, too.\n\nYour mileage might vary, but this does not seem to reflect an American president who’s “very angry” with the Russian leader.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "With his choice for drug czar, Trump adds to his team of Fox-affiliated amateurs",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Nearly eight years ago, Donald Trump nominated Republican Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy — a position best known to the public as the nation’s “drug czar.” That did not turn out well.\n\nFollowing explosive reporting from The Washington Post, which found that the GOP congressman championed legislation that hindered federal agents from going after the Big Pharma firms that flooded the country with addictive opioids, Marino’s nomination collapsed and he withdrew from consideration.\n\nEight years later, the president has a new drug czar in mind, who’s notable for different kinds of reasons. The Washington Post reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Friday that he intends to nominate Sara A. Carter, a Fox News contributor, to serve as director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. “From Afghanistan to our Border, Sarah’s relentless pursuit of Justice, especially in tackling the Fentanyl and Opioid Crisis, has exposed terrorists, drug lords, and sex traffickers,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, misspelling her first name.\n\nOne of the reasons the Carter nomination stood out is the growing list of Fox News personalities who’ve landed powerful positions on Team Trump. In January, The New York Times published a tally and found 19 “former Fox News hosts, commentators, on-air medical experts, producers and other personnel” who’d landed jobs in the Republican administration. Soon after, Media Matters published a revised total, putting the new number at 20. (The list did not include Attorney General Pam Bondi, who briefly moonlit as a guest host of a Fox News program while she was serving as Florida’s chief law enforcement official.)\n\nAs March got underway, the president also appointed Fox News personalities Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, and as March neared its end, Trump added yet another Fox News contributor to his White House operation, tapping Carter to serve as the drug czar.\n\nBut complicating matters is the nominee’s resume. As a Stat News report explained, “Carter’s selection comes as a surprise: Her background is not in drug policy, public health, or law enforcement, and she has never served in government.”\n\nOr put another way, Carter will be an amateur, joining Trump’s team of amateurs.\n\nIt is not exactly a secret that the incumbent president sees governing expertise and policymaking experience as qualities to be avoided. Indeed, during the Republican’s first term, those with expertise and experience tended to be the people who discouraged the president — the first chief executive in American history to reach the Oval Office without any experience in public office at any level — from taking steps he was eager to take.\n\nAs a result, Trump appears to have gone out of his way to lean into his preference for amateurs in a second term, choosing inexperienced and unqualified loyalists for much of the White House Cabinet.\n\nThose who celebrate rookies in positions of influence have reason to celebrate. Those who value qualifications have reason to worry.",

        "title": "Trump appears to be already laying the plans for a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump threw down the gauntlet to people who want to preserve constitutional democracy in this country. He told NBC’s Kristen Welker that he is “not joking” about the possibility of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment’s prohibition on any person being “elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nWhen asked how he would get around those words, Trump said ominously, “There are methods which you could do it.” I will leave it to others to identify loopholes in the language of the 22nd Amendment, assuming that the president cares about such niceties. Already, Trump is laying the groundwork for a third term, separate from the debates over the 22nd Amendment, by destroying or intimidating institutions that might stand in his way and claiming unconstitutional authority to control elections.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future.\n\nWe saw further evidence of this strategy on Friday when the president brought another prominent American law firm to heel. The terms of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom’s surrender erode its independence, assure it will be a vassal of MAGA-world well into the future, and show Trump’s determination to ready the way to end free and fair presidential elections three years from now.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future. Attacking, discrediting, intimidating and silencing both critics and the institutions that support criticism is familiar in regimes that seek to consolidate their power in the hope that they will never relinquish it. We see signs of this strategy in the president’s attack on law firms, universities, the free press and judges. His executive orders are consolidating his power and easing us toward a nondemocratic future.\n\nRecall that Trump urged his supporters last year to “get out and vote, just this time.” He explained that if they did, they “won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore ... ”\n\nOn Sunday, the president signaled that even if the 2028 election is held as scheduled, he wants to ensure it would not be competitive, just as Viktor Orbán achieved in Hungary. What Trump would consider an achievement is, as The Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum writes, an autocratic takeover. Since Orban won a second term as Hungary’s president, he has mixed paeans to populism and family values with the destruction of press freedom and academic freedom and the politicization of the courts and the civil service. That has eased his way to claim emergency powers and amend Hungary’s constitution, even as the country has fallen into poverty and corruption has become legalized.\n\nHoward Simon, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, explains that “capturing or marginalizing independent centers of thought and dissent that could challenge their authority” is what authoritarians do.\n\nThat brings us back to Skadden Arps, which last week became the second firm to cut a deal with the administration in the wake of Trump’s executive orders targeting various law firms. Skadden had not been the subject of an executive order, and three firms have already successfully challenged the orders in court. But Trump said the firm agreed to “essentially a settlement,” including “a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services during the Trump Administration and beyond.”\n\nIf the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the president insisted that some of the ransom he extracted from Skadden to stay out of his line of fire would be devoted to “ensuring fairness in our Justice System.” Note also, the open-ended phrases like “and beyond” and “at least.” Whatever happens in the 2028 election, you can rest assured that Skadden Arps will not represent anyone opposing Trump or seeking to hold him accountable.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that many other firms are unwilling to take on clients who are Trump opponents. “The president is following a playbook from other countries whose leaders have sought to undermine democratic systems and the rule of law, including Russia, Turkey, and Hungary,” writes the Post’s Michael Birnbaum. “Leaders in those countries have similarly attacked lawyers with the effect of hollowing out a pillar of justice systems to expand their power without violating existing laws.”\n\nIf that were not enough to convince pro-democracy forces to mobilize now to ensure we have a free and fair election in 2028. The president’s recent executive order on elections purports to seize powers for himself from both the states and the independent Election Assistance Commission. Linda Meyer, emeritus law professor at Quinnipiac University, says, “The decentralization of voting systems has been a guarantee of integrity in federal elections because federal employees in the current administration cannot control the entire process. This EO is targeted to wrest control over voting from states and allow the feds to get info about how each person votes.”\n\nIn what Meyer calls the “worst case scenario,” Trump can use his executive order to “target federal enforcement of this EO in [Democratic] areas and throw out votes there … while leaving [Republican] districts alone. Perhaps he can also find out exactly who voted for him and who didn’t and ‘investigate’ only those registrants who voted against him.”\n\nFor someone like Trump, who thinks an election can only be fair if he wins, the temptation to use his order that way may prove irresistible. For those who believe that the 2028 elections can be free and fair no matter what Trump does, the president’s executive order on elections proves that he thinks otherwise.\n\nAnd as The New Republic’s Michael Tomasky points out, Trump’s actions at the Defense Department, starting with the nomination of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have all been undertaken with the goal of “purging … an independent, rules-based military in favor of a military loyal to a single leader.” The result is that “there’s no one around to stop Trump from declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution or even an election.”\n\nRegardless of whether the courts rule on the constitutionality of a third term for Trump, he is already preparing to make their rulings moot through means that have nothing to with the 22nd Amendment. If the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly. Political leaders, lawyers and election experts must map a strategy for stopping the president. And the rest of us should prepare to copy the strategies for mass mobilization and protest used to save democracy in other countries. There is no time to waste.",

But history has shown that if this works and it remains legal, it won’t be long before other billionaires adopt similar tactics.\n\nGiving voters cash directly is just cutting out the middlemen of campaign consultants and ad makers.\n\nIf that happens, sweepstakes could become a staple of every election cycle as billionaires compete to offer you cash. You could call it Balance-of-Powerball, maybe, or MAGA Millions.\n\nIt’s perhaps inevitable that we would end up here. After the Supreme Court began dismantling the campaign finance system with the 2010 decision in Citizens United, corporations and the wealthy have found more and more creative ways to spend money on elections. Giving voters cash directly is just cutting out the middlemen of campaign consultants and ad makers.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the specifics of this case.\n\nTwo political action committees linked to Musk, America PAC and Building America’s Future, have disclosed spending about $17 million on the Wisconsin race, while Musk donated $3 million to the state Republican Party, according to ProPublica. They and other big spenders have helped push overall spending on the race to more than $80 million, making it the most expensive judicial race in American history.\n\nBut Musk didn’t stop there. In true entrepreneurial fashion, he looked for other ways to influence the race.\n\nFirst, America PAC put together a two-sentence petition “in opposition to activist judges,” offering $100 to any registered voter in Wisconsin who signed it and another $100 for any voter who referred another person to sign it. In exchange, voters just have to submit their full name, email, mailing address and cellphone numbers — all valuable information for anyone running a get-out-the-vote effort, especially for a low-turnout judicial election.\n\nIt’s not the first time Musk’s PAC has used this tactic. In the run-up to the November presidential election, America PAC ran a “sweepstakes” offering million-dollar prizes for voters who signed a petition that seemed designed to gather names for a get-out-the-vote effort in swing states. Musk’s own lawyers admitted in court that the “winners” of the prizes were not actually randomly chosen but were more like paid spokespeople.\n\nOfficially, the giveaways are just for voters who signed a petition. But let’s be real. The PACs wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t think it would help Musk’s preferred candidate, Brad Schimel. Musk is not exactly known for charity. (In fact, his private charitable foundation did not give away the minimum amount required to avoid tax penalties for three years in a row, most recently missing the mark by $421 million.)\n\nWhen you think about it, the million-dollar giveaway even seems a little cheap.\n\nMusk is currently worth $337 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A million dollars to him is equivalent to about one-hundredth of a cent to a person making $100,000 a year. He could give a million dollars to half the people who’ve already voted in Wisconsin, and he’d still be the 11th richest person in the world.\n\nThe giveaway tactic has survived court challenges before, so it seems like it’s probably on solid ground, legally. The PAC has already identified a voter in Green Bay, Scott Ainsworth, as the recipient of its first $1 million check. Ainsworth posed for a photo with a giant check like in those old contests from the 1980s with Ed McMahon and the “Prize Patrol.”\n\nThe giveaway tactic has survived court challenges before.\n\nBut Musk then went further, posting on X, the social media platform that he owns, that he would give away two more checks for $1 million each to attendees of a Wisconsin event “limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election.”\n\nElection law expert Rick Hasen wrote that because those checks would only be given to people who have voted, they would “appear to violate the plain meaning” of a state anticorruption statute. The post was later deleted, and the Wisconsin attorney general is seeking a court order to stop that particular giveaway.\n\nAgain, “Is this legal?” is a question for the attorney general and the courts. But it’s not the question under consideration here.\n\nOne of Musk’s stated reasons for getting involved is so the Wisconsin court will approve a gerrymandered map that gives Republicans a slight edge in the U.S. House of Representatives. (One might also note that Tesla is currently suing over a Wisconsin law that bars its dealerships.) But whatever Musk’s reasons for using his insane wealth to influence the election, the effort is unseemly.\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, it doesn’t matter what his motivations are. You might even agree with the next billionaire who wants to try such tactics — or at least favor the same outcome as them. But is this how we want to run our democracy, by dangling cash in front of voters? What next, scratch-off ballots with random prizes for voting “correctly”?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In America, our leaders shouldn’t hide from the people they represent. That is why I recently held town halls in three congressional districts — California’s 22nd, 40th and 41st districts — that are key for winning back the House in 2026. All three are currently held by Republicans, and I plan to travel to red districts in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Nevada and Ohio in the upcoming months.\n\nWhile GOP lawmakers are canceling town halls after being booed and protested, I am working alongside community leaders and advocates to build a movement with two goals: mobilize voters in swing districts and block Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid and education funding.\n\nMeetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy.\n\nAmericans are scared and they deserve the chance to ask their representatives why they voted for a budget plan that hurts the working class. With that in mind, I am visiting districts where there is a high percentage of residents on Medicaid. I am spending my time and resources immersed in these districts — meeting with working-class Americans and organizing. In the 22nd district, where I held my first town hall, 64% of residents are on Medicaid. It’s deeply disappointing that their own member of Congress wouldn’t show up to discuss his vote on a budget that would cut this program.\n\nRepublicans tried to dismiss my town halls as a “stunt,” but meetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy. I hold one in my own district every single month, and I believe it is something that every member of Congress should do in person — no matter how tough the questions might be.\n\nAround 1,000 people came to each of my town halls, ready to ask questions and fight for change. In rural, deep red California, where last cycle a few hundred people showed up at such events, this turnout was historic. I heard from attendees who had never seen so many Democrats gather in their area before. While there was excitement and readiness to mobilize, people were also emotional and angry about how this administration is impacting their lives. And though they were upset with their own Republican members of Congress, they were also fed up with the Democrats in Washington who are failing to fight back against the cuts that will put their lives in danger.\n\nAcross the three town halls, the same questions kept coming up: What are Democrats going to do? What can I do? It’s critical that our party recognizes that people feel angry and want change.\n\nThere are five steps that we must take right now.\n\nFirst, we need to flip three Republican votes on the budget reconciliation bill GOP leaders are putting together in Congress. This legislation slashes funding to Medicaid and education. By sharing stories about the consequences of ripping away money for Medicaid and schools, we can embarrass Republican representatives to change their vote and put the well-being of their constituents over their loyalty to Trump.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment.\n\nSecond, Democratic leaders should outline a clear organizing plan for 30 Republican-held districts that are competitive. This plan should include resources for potential volunteers, we should direct them to what they can do in these districts. This can mean hosting town halls, running phone banks, registering people to vote, knocking on doors and sharing stories on social media. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, is hiring full-time organizers in GOP representatives’ districts to get out the vote for local races.\n\nThird, we need an army of people in red districts distributing information. In Bakersfield, a woman at my town hall told me she has been delivering food to friends and neighbors in need while explaining how the Republicans and Trump are cutting SNAP and other benefits. Our party needs to recruit people and provide resources to spread information within communities about the harm Republicans are causing.\n\nFourth, we need candidates who can run in these districts at all levels of government. During the town halls, I met remarkable community leaders, parents and young people who are eager to get involved. Our party should make it a top priority to invest in candidates who decide to run for these seats.\n\nFinally, we need a vision that helps the working class and gives Americans hope for the future. At town halls and other local events, we must offer a plan for how we’re going to improve people’s lives when we take back the House. It should include specifics like a higher minimum wage, Medicare for All, $10-per-day childcare, 10 million new units of housing, and new tech and advanced manufacturing jobs to increase communities’ wealth and income.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment. We must acknowledge voters’ fury, help them organize and offer concrete policies for a better country. That is how we build a movement, defeat the far-right and overcome the deep political nihilism in our country.",

        "title": "Justices Sotomayor and Jackson criticize court’s refusal to clarify criminal appeal rights",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Supreme Court exercises power not only in how it decides cases but in which cases it chooses to decide. We were reminded of this reality by a new dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat dissent came Monday on the court’s order list, a routine document publicizing action in pending high court appeals. That action is mostly unexplained refusals to hear petitions for review. But sometimes the justices make their thoughts known. That’s what happened in the case of Missouri death row prisoner Lance Shockley, whose petition the majority rejected over Sotomayor’s dissent.\n\nThe legal issue presented by Shockley’s appeal might sound dry, but it is quite important.\n\nIt takes four justices to grant review. The two-justice dissent therefore reinforces the power the court has in shaping its own docket, as well as the importance of the court’s membership to how that docket is shaped. Sotomayor and Jackson have previously called attention to criminal cases their colleagues have refused to hear. They’re two of the three Democratic appointees on the nine-justice court with six Republican appointees.\n\nThe legal issue presented by Shockley’s appeal might sound dry, but it is quite important. It involves something called a “certificate of appealability,” which state prisoners must secure in order to press appeals in federal court. The ability to obtain such certificates differs around the country, and by turning down Shockley’s appeal, the justices turned down the opportunity to clarify the rules and make the law uniform.\n\nThe federal circuit in which his case proceeded has a stricter process than other circuits. So even though a judge voted to grant him the ability to appeal, that judge was overridden by other circuit judges, thus depriving Shockley of an appeal. Sotomayor wrote that she would have granted review to resolve the differences among the circuits “and decide whether the Courts of Appeal can dismiss an appeal after a judge votes to grant a certificate.”\n\nThe Obama appointee wrote that Shockley’s case “exemplifies the problems” with the approach taken by the St. Louis-based circuit in his case. He was convicted of killing a police officer after the prosecution argued he committed the crime because the officer was investigating his role in a drunken-driving incident that resulted in the death of Shockley’s sister-in-law’s fiancé.\n\nDuring jury selection, a potential juror said he had written and self-published a book, but Shockley’s lawyer didn’t follow up on what it was about. He became the jury foreperson.\n\nThat unexplored aspect of the juror’s background turned out to be important because, Sotomayor recounted, quoting a previous ruling in the litigation, the book was a “fictionalized autobiography” describing the “brutal and graphic revenge murder of a defendant who killed the protagonist’s wife in a drunken-driving accident.” The book’s protagonist was a fictionalized version of the juror who “viewed the defendant as escaping justice in the court system because the defendant received only probation following his conviction,” Sotomayor recounted. The foreperson brought the book to deliberations and handed it out to other jurors.\n\nYet “inexplicably,” as Sotomayor put it, Shockley’s counsel declined to take testimony from the foreperson or other jurors in support of a mistrial. “As a result, the trial court did not hear evidence regarding the foreperson’s alleged bias and misconduct or its effect on other jurors, ... some of whom later indicated that they had looked through the book,” the justice wrote. She called it “difficult to see” how the defense’s approach “could fail to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Nonetheless, Shockley couldn’t press his claim on appeal due to the 8th Circuit’s rejection of his certificate of appealability, even though a judge on the circuit wanted to grant him one.\n\n“Had the Court instead followed the approach taken in the Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, that error would have been avoided,” Sotomayor wrote, joined by Jackson, a Biden appointee.\n\nAgain, the legal question here isn’t whether Shockley would ultimately succeed in his appeal but whether he could press it at all. The court’s refusal to settle the matter one way or the other means that the rules will continue to operate differently in different courts around the country.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In spring 2024, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that found a government official could not use her position to punish a disfavored political organization by going after the third parties that did business with it.\n\nLikewise, President Donald Trump’s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional. But unless lawyers stand up to the president and clients stand by their lawyers, the damage to the legal system will be profound.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s efforts to not just punish law firms he does not like, but also the clients that do business with those firms, are flat out unconstitutional.\n\nClients and lawyers must band together against these blatantly illegal actions by the Trump administration and flip the script: They need not defend their own actions but, rather, force government attorneys who may seek to punish the clients of any “disfavored” law firms to justify such unconstitutional efforts, which will be impossible to do.\n\nSo far, the president has targeted five private law firms and the clients they represent, claiming that his administration will punish those clients who have the temerity to do business with those firms. Two of these firms, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps, have capitulated to this pressure, expressing fears that the president’s attacks threaten their business model, and they will lose clients who might not want lawyers representing them who have such a bad relationship with the federal government.\n\nThis fear is certainly real, but if the president can scare clients away from the firms that might take positions against his administration, there will be fewer and fewer lawyers willing to take such stands. If that happens, our system of rights, protected by law, and not dispensed at the fiat of the executive, will crumble. But here’s the thing: such actions by the president are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nLast year, in a case filed by the National Rifle Association, on facts eerily similar to those surrounding the president’s actions, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, found that the efforts of a state agency in New York to punish companies that did business with the NRA violated its free speech rights enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\nWhile it is deeply troubling that some firms feel the need to appease the White House in the face of such unconstitutional retribution, it will take more than just a handful of firms to resist such bullying. And if such resistance does not materialize, the threats to the rule of law will only increase, and our legal system will not serve to protect everyone’s rights or facilitate the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n\nIt is in everyone’s best interest — even those clients who might fear retaliation from the Trump administration for retaining disfavored firms — to condemn the president’s efforts to attack members of the legal profession simply for playing their essential role in our legal system. These clients should stand by their lawyers and those lawyers must turn the tables on their opponents. They must force government lawyers who might take punitive action on behalf of the president to justify such unconstitutional behavior in court. Since government lawyers take an oath to the Constitution, they, too, have a duty to resist facilitating such punitive and unconstitutional actions.\n\nAddressing U.S. attorneys in 1940 about the role of the prosecutor in a society that abided by the rule of law, then-Attorney General Robert Jackson — who would also serve as a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and was later a Supreme Court associate justice — explained: “While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries.\n\nIn the last light of the first Trump administration, Justice Department lawyers refused to help the president remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Recently, federal prosecutors resisted pressure to dismiss the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. As one of those lawyers, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten, explained: “Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way. If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already found the fools and cowards willing to take improper and unethical action against its adversaries. Remember, President Richard Nixon, too, cycled through several lawyers until he found someone willing to fire the special prosecutor investigating him, but the “Saturday Night Massacre” also helped lead to Nixon’s ultimate demise.\n\nThe ability of lawyers and their clients to operate free of such animus is an essential element of our legal system and the rule of law itself. And everyone benefits by a functioning legal system: a financial institution under investigation, a worker cheated out of a fair wage or someone facing deportation.\n\nIn a democracy that promises “Equal Justice Under Law,” a phrase chiseled above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court building, lawyers are critical to deliver on the promise of such equal justice, not for some, but for all. Attacks on lawyers — even elite ones — are designed to bring the entire legal system to heel.\n\nTurning to Robert Jackson once again, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, writing for the Supreme Court, he set forth what should be our national True North when it comes to speech and action disfavored by government officials: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s attacks on law firms are designed to not just dictate orthodoxy, but also to bend the legal system to President Trump’s will. These seemingly petty actions, from high officials, are setting us down a path where the legal institutions designed to protect everyone will no longer serve to check abuses of power. Everyone within the legal system — its judges, lawyers, clients and average citizens — must resist such efforts and do so together.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 30 episode of \"Ayman.\"\n\nWashington has been in a frenzy over the Trump administration’s Signal scandal, in which some of the president’s top officials were caught discussing a bombing campaign in Yemen in an unsecured group chat that somehow included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nDespite all these questions, somehow the most important part of this story isn't getting any attention in elite Washington circles.\n\nPeople were outraged. Many wondered how this could have happened. Some pressed for national security adviser Mike Waltz, who added Goldberg to the chat, to resign. Questions have also swirled about another chat participant, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked if Hegseth could have possibly been drinking before he sent the military plans. There’s also a question about why no one has been fired yet. (President Donald Trump said Saturday that no one will be.)Despite all these questions, somehow the most important part of this story isn’t getting any attention in elite Washington circles. And it’s this: Why is America bombing Yemen in the first place? How many people are being killed in these bombings? Who are they? If Congress hasn’t voted on it, are the bombings unconstitutional? Are they a violation of the United Nations Charter?\n\nTo be clear, American attacks on Yemen didn’t just start with Trump. For years, Houthi rebels in Yemen have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a major trade route. The attacks started shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and the Houthis say they won’t stop until Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has ended.\n\nIn response to these attacks, Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on the Houthis. Shortly after, Biden admitted those strikes weren’t successful. However, he also pledged to continue them. And now it’s Trump’s turn to pick up where Biden left off. The president is doing so without any debate or congressional approval. In March, he declared the group a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSome may remember that as a candidate, Trump pledged to end America’s era of endless wars. It was a smart campaign strategy. The American people are sick and tired of these wars. But as soon as Trump retook the White House, he did just the opposite. He’s ramped up bombings on Yemen. He has also effectively given a green light to Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu to end the ceasefire in Gaza. On Iran, Trump told my colleague Kristen Welker: “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.” On Greenland, Trump told Welker, “I never take military force off the table.”\n\nSo far, this president isn’t a peacemaker, and he’s not ending America's forever wars — he’s threatening to start new ones.\n\nBut that doesn’t seem to be of concern to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They’re concerned about keeping American secrets safe, and the bombing campaign itself is just background noise.\n\nSo far, this president isn't a peacemaker and he’s not ending America's forever wars — he’s threatening to start new ones.\n\nIt’s not just the politicians who are missing the real story here. In an interview with NPR, Goldberg was asked about how, in the aftermath of his story, there has been little focus on the over 50 people, including women and children, who were killed in these strikes and whether he believed people were “burying the lead.”“I don’t know if we’re burying the lead, because, obviously, huge breaches in national security and safety of information — that’s a very, very important story, obviously,” Goldberg responded.\n\nThis is the perfect example of a Washington controversy: Democrats and Republicans are screaming at each other while the most powerful voices on both sides support the same underlying policy — a seemingly illegal war on a sovereign Middle Eastern country without congressional approval.",

The legislative branch was granted sole authority over some of the most powerful aspects of the state, including taxation and declarations of war. It was left to the first Congress to finish filling out most of the document’s details, like determining the size of the Supreme Court and the scope of the executive departments under the president.\n\nThe Republican leaders of the 119th Congress seem to have entirely forgotten their place in the federal pecking order. There are few GOP legislators these days who are willing to present themselves as an equal of President Donald Trump, let alone willing to tell him what to do. Their prostration before Trump has reduced the most powerful branch on paper to petitioning the president’s court for the means to achieve even Congress’ most modest goals.\n\nThe Republican leaders of the 119th Congress seem to have entirely forgotten their place in the federal pecking order.\n\nTrump, in his race to rip out the gears of government and illegally tear down what Congress has established, has made no secret of this new power dynamic. Congressional Republicans have offered little public outcry against the president usurping their power, slashing whole agencies and departments their predecessors established under federal law. Not only that, but the legislature’s new deference to the White House is compelled to take a bizarre detour through billionaire Elon Musk, who in his role as the de facto head of the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency appears to have more control over the Republican agenda than House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nBehind closed doors, Republicans are desperate to keep Trump and Musk’s cuts from hurting them with their constituents — or at least to get some kind of heads-up from DOGE’s hatchet men. The New York Times on Friday reported a behind-the-scenes look at how Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., leapt to protect federal offices that serve his constituents and provide jobs in his district. Rather than using any of his influence as chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Cole and his aides had to reach out to Musk and DOGE, hat in hand, to ask them to reconsider.\n\nAlongside his counterpart in the Senate and the head of the House Ways and Means Committee, Cole is a key gatekeeper of the power of the purse. In the past, he would have been rightly seen as one of the most powerful figures in Washington. The power the speaker and majority leader wield over those committees has been used in turn to boost their own influence. Members hustled hard for earmarked funds to bring federal projects to their states and districts, which the president’s administration would then carry out. It has historically been a tangible way for lawmakers to show that they were getting things done in Washington.\n\nNow things are entirely reversed, as the White House asserts total control over federal projects, leaving personal appeals to Musk and his loyal staffers as the only way for Republicans to stave off politically damaging cuts. While the earlier system was undoubtedly partisan, there was always a chance the next election would put the gavel back in the hands of the current ranking member.\n\nBut Democrats now find themselves iced out of the decision-making process entirely, as The Boston Globe reported earlier this month:\n\nRepresentative Jake Auchincloss, a [Massachusetts] Democrat, said that he tried to get in touch with DOGE about a particular concern — he wouldn’t elaborate on the inquiry or explain how he conveyed it — but that ‘DOGE had every opportunity to engage with me in good faith and stiff-armed me.’\n\nThat seems to suit the GOP’s congressional leadership just fine. If the only purpose of this Republican Congress is to follow the president’s instructions (however capricious or arbitrary), then there’s no need for Democratic input. Speaker Johnson is obeying Trump’s directive to deal simultaneously with an annual spending bill and reupping the 2017 tax cuts, despite the risk that figuring out all the details may be too much for his fragile caucus to bear. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is busy trying to figure out how to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent like Trump wants without driving up the national debt by several trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nThe urge to please Trump has Congress scrambling to carry out his whims, bending over backward to do so without relying on a single Democratic vote.\n\nThe urge to please Trump has Congress scrambling to carry out his whims, bending over backward to do so without relying on a single Democratic vote. Thune spent last week preparing to lobby the Senate parliamentarian to let those costly tax cuts dodge the 60-vote threshold for its budget bill. If he fails, he’ll either need to convince his caucus to overrule her or find enough Democrats to break a filibuster. Meanwhile, Johnson was left to figure out what to do with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the former No. 4 member of his leadership team. She stepped down from that role, but her nomination to be U.N. ambassador has been pulled to protect the GOP’s exceedingly slim House majority. Anything to avoid engaging with Democrats and confronting the idea Congress should be more than a rubber stamp for the president.\n\nUnder the weight of Trump’s gravitational pull, the milelong stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue that separates the Capitol from the White House has compressed into a singularity. When facing voters next fall, congressional Republicans are hoping to do so lauding not their own victories but those of the president and the richest man in the world. It should be embarrassing for a member of the U.S. Congress to campaign on their proximity to power — but that seems to be good enough in the shameless vacuum of ambition that is laying ruin to the Founders’ temple to democracy.",

        "content": "Before neo-Nazi Anders Breivik massacred 77 people in Norway in 2011, he emailed a 1,518-page document, a compendium of his own writing and other far-right texts, to over 1,000 people. The deranged screed warned that Muslim immigration to Europe amounted to an “invasion” of people — whose culture was “incompatible with Western society — that would lead to the “cultural and demographic suicide” of the continent.\n\nEarlier this month, the vice president of the United States went on TV to say the same thing. Speaking with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, JD Vance asserted that Germany is suffering an “invasion” of people who are “totally culturally incompatible” with “Western civilization.” This purported “invasion,” Vance said, will lead to a “civilizational suicide” if it’s not stopped.\n\nIt barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Donald Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers. I’ve witnessed this process of normalization over the last eight years as a reporter covering the far right, seeing neo-Nazi talking points, especially around immigration, enter the mainstream discourse with horrifying, accelerating speed.\n\nIt barely triggers a 24-hour news cycle anymore when the vice president and his boss, President Trump, use the same language as fascist mass murderers.\n\nI fear now that many of us here in America still haven’t registered the logical endpoint of such rhetoric, which both dehumanizes subgroups of human beings and presents them as an existential threat. I fear that even as the Trump-Vance administration now embarks on its extralegal campaign of mass deportation — paired with a campaign to rip away the judiciary of its power to keep the White House in check — many Americans are reluctant to come to terms with the idea of sprawling concentration camps, and worse, in America today. But the extreme actions and rhetoric being taken by the administration are not dissimilar from those deployed in the early stages of some of the worst regimes of the 20th century.\n\n“Concentration camp regimes always need a group they can turn into outsiders by making its members seem so dangerous that the government needs to remove those people from society,” Andrea Pitzer, author of “One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps,” told me. “You can’t typically do that without years — years! — of rhetoric demonizing them. Even with the Nazis, it took more than five years from Hitler becoming chancellor of Germany until the mass roundup of Jews as a group began with Kristallnacht in November 1938.”\n\nTrump, Vance and the GOP, of course, have spent years demonizing immigrants, the rhetoric reaching a fever pitch during the 2024 election, with Trump saying immigrants were “poisoning the blood of the country” — a phrasing that bore an unnerving resemblance to wording in Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” — and with Vance spreading the vicious lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were stealing and eating their neighbors’ pets.\n\n“Over time, this demonization creates real fear and gets citizens to go along with measures like concentration camps,” Pitzer said, adding that members of the Trump administration — including Trump, Vance and Elon Musk — have brazenly used racist and dehumanizing language. “By using this kind of language, they’re not just nodding to the same source material of eugenics from a hundred years ago; they appear to be cosplaying earlier fascist leaders, with aspirational nostalgia for their power and abuses.”\n\nThe last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come. There was the abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was clearly detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University, as his crying, eight months’ pregnant wife looked on, recording it. (The Justice Department alleges Khalil withheld required information about his past employment in Syria and his membership in certain groups when he applied for permanent resident status.)\n\nThere was a video of masked ICE agents — essentially secret police — near Boston stopping and arresting Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national and PhD student at Tufts University. Ozturk, who is in the U.S. on a valid visa, was targeted for having “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” according to the DHS, an apparent reference to an op-ed she published in a student newspaper arguing that Tufts should divest from companies tied to Israel. She was taken to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana.\n\nThe Trump administration is proud of what it’s doing.\n\nThere was the deportation of 250 purported Venezuelan gang members to a notorious gulag in El Salvador with no due process, in defiance of a federal court order that the plane deporting them turn around and come back to America, a photographer witnessing the inmates be slapped and kicked and shoved, capturing the moments when their heads were forcibly shaved.\n\nThere were the deaths of two immigrants at the Krome North Processing Center in Miami, which has been described as “hell on Earth,” with videos capturing detainees held “like sardines in a jar,” sometimes without access to food, water or toilets.\n\nThe Trump administration is proud of what it’s doing, blasting out news releases and social media posts bragging about its latest detention or forced deportation. “Following my previously signed executive orders, I proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a radical foreign Pro Hamas student on the campus of Columbia University,” Trump wrote on Truth Social after Khalil’s arrest. “This is the first arrest of many to come.”\n\nIn support of his “stiff-arm saluting” billionaire “first buddy” Musk, the president also suggested that he would send anti-Tesla protesters to the infamous prison in El Salvador, where inmates are made to do forced labor. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,” Trump wrote, again, on Truth Social. “Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.”\n\nThis week the U.S. homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted a video of herself to X visiting the El Salvadoran prison, standing in front of a cell packed with shirtless brown men with shaved heads, staring silently at the camera from behind bars as Noem, wearing a baseball cap, warned immigrants that they too could end up in this gulag. “I also want everybody to know, if you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you can face,” she said.\n\nAnd last month, the White House posted a deeply disturbing, dehumanizing video on X appearing to show ICE officials placing immigrants in handcuffs before they boarded a plane for their deportation. “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,” the caption read, using the initialism for autonomous sensory meridian response — a pleasant physical sensation prompted by typically soft sounds. In this case, the sound was of human beings being put in chains. Pitzer recently went viral on Bluesky for noting that historically “concentration-camp regimes were proud of what they were doing and wanted attention for it.”\n\nIn Myanmar in 2015, the regime allowed journalists to visit the camps where Rohingya Muslims were being detained. In Augusto Pinochet’s Chile in the 1970s, photographers were allowed into the National Stadium, where people were being detained and tortured. “Even the Nazis allowed New York Times and Times of London reporters into their early concentration camps in 1933,” Pitzer told me. “They wanted their targets to be terrified, but they were proud of what they were doing.”\n\nThe last couple of weeks have offered a preview of some of the horrors to come.\n\nFor now, the administration is focused on pro-Palestinian activists and immigrants they insist are “gang members,” often with thin evidence and no due process. But as the famous Martin Niemöller poem suggests (“First they came for the communists / and I did not speak out / for I was not a communist …”), fascistic regimes eventually come for the rest of us, too.\n\n“The arc of concentration camps is twofold,” Pitzer explained. “First, there’s supposedly some very bad group so dangerous that the government says they have to be removed from society. Second, the definition of who’s dangerous expands, often coming to include political opponents and rivals.\n\n“If the government can arrest civilians with no criminal record and put them on planes out of the country without accounting for who they are or for any actual legal process — as has been happening in recent weeks — what would stop them from deporting whomever they like?” Pitzer continued. “Or from saying they had deported detainees while actually disappearing people to black sites internally? If the courts can’t enforce due process and find out who’s being detained, where they are now and what’s happening to them, then we’re all vulnerable.”\n\nWhen Breivik, the Norwegian neo-Nazi who went on an anti-immigrant killing spree in 2011, posted his murderous manifesto, it included a quotation, often attributed to Napoleon, that imagined an all-powerful leader, free to do whatever he pleased. Last month Trump posted the same quote on X.\n\n“He who saves his Country violates no Law,” it said.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Nearly lost in last week’s wall-to-wall coverage of the Signal group chat security lapse was the role of a different kind of app, one at least as popular as Signal, in further revealing the flawed security protocols among some of the same, most highly targeted officials in our government. Reports showed that the Venmo accounts of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz, among others, were left public, revealing the officials’ personal contacts on the app.\n\nAllowing your friends list to be public, let alone your actual transactions, makes it easier for adversaries to target you.\n\nThe digital payment application Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, is the third-ranked payment system among the 60% of Americans who use such apps to pay for purchases. Instead of pulling out our credit cards, over half of us pull out our phones, at least twice a week, and use a digital payment app. So do several of the senior participants in the Signal group chat involving the U.S. plan to attack Houthis in Yemen, apparently. But unlike the average person, the way they use it poses critical security risks and questions.\n\nFollowing the Signal chat discovery, in addition to Hegseth and Waltz, the accounts of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; Dan Katz, chief of staff at the Treasury Department; Joe Kent, chief of staff at the State Department; and Brian McCormack, a senior National Security Council staffer, were also revealed to be set to public. Last July, Wired magazine confirmed that Vice President JD Vance let his Venmo contact list default to public. Among his contacts were wealthy individuals who seem to qualify as the “elite” that Vance claims to disdain, and some of the authors of Project 2025. Vance didn’t comment on the Wired reporting at the time. Waltz and Wiles made their accounts private after they were contacted by Wired for comment last week. The Pentagon hasn’t commented on Hegseth’s Venmo account.\n\nVenmo automatically adds your friends and contacts directly from your phone. This makes it easier to send a payment to someone you know or regularly do business with. Hegseth, or someone with access to his account, didn’t opt out of that feature. Another feature makes your contact list publicly viewable. Hegseth’s account allowed that, too, although it doesn’t mean his payment transactions were public (though in Venmo’s early days they would be). But McCormack’s transactions appear to have been public, as were Katz’s — which is why we know that Katz made a payment in 2018 accompanied solely by an eggplant emoji.\n\nVenmo is different than many payment apps because of its dual social and financial nature and because it makes you take action to avoid having your contacts and transactions default to public. Venmo’s early strategy was to build trust and confidence with users by capitalizing on the comfort level of transacting business with friends, by importing users’ social media and phone contacts. You signed up for Venmo through your existing Facebook account. And, by making payment transactions public, and including a note feature to maybe show your buddies that you bought pizza for everyone, Venmo became a social media-like display of what your shopping, dining and partying looked like last weekend.\n\nIt was only after researchers found then-President Joe Biden’s public Venmo contacts (it took them 10 minutes) in 2021 that Venmo added the ability to make contact lists private. You can also now shield your transactions from public view.\n\nEspecially if you hold a high-security position, allowing your friends list to be public, let alone your actual transactions, makes it easier for adversaries to target you. It need not be a foreign intelligence service pursuing you for this to work. It doesn’t require much sophistication. Criminal organizations and solo hackers, armed with your contacts, can send you a spear phishing message using the recognizable email address or phone number of a friend and unleash malware into your device, including ransomware. Hackers can spend thousands of hours trying to find a phone number, email or name of a contact their target might accept a message from, click on an attachment in that message and become a victim. But hackers wouldn’t need to spend hours targeting these officials. Not with public contact and transaction lists.\n\nA foreign intelligence service could wreak even more havoc. Their abilities include being able to entice you to click on an attachment, presumably sent by a friend, and install a beacon virus that receives hacker commands. They can covertly install logging software that documents every keystroke you enter while on your device. Maybe even the words you type in a sensitive group chat with colleagues.\n\nSuch data can also be a treasure trove for journalists and watchdog groups searching for conflicts of interest or professional biases.\n\nSuch data can also be a treasure trove for journalists and watchdog groups searching for conflicts of interest or professional biases. Hegseth’s contacts, for example, contain myriad wealthy individuals in the Silicon Valley tech industry, including Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal, as well as other CEOs who have large DOD contracts. Also listed were senior executives in health care. That might interest pundits wondering if the VA is already headed to privatizing veterans’ medical care.\n\nIf you are among Venmo’s millions of users, you may wonder about how to make your account safer. Thankfully, Venmo now offers options, and there are “how to” instructions across the internet, including one from The Washington Post.\n\nThe Signal group chat scandal and the Venmo accounts revelations aren’t isolated incidents. They reflect either a shocking lack of security awareness among many Trump Cabinet officials, or a reckless disregard for national security — or possibly both. Senior intelligence community leaders don’t need to be cybersecurity experts to protect their personal and professional lives from penetration. Each of their departments should have technical experts who can harden their bosses’ digital security immediately upon reporting for duty. Why that hasn’t happened should be the subject of congressional inquiry.\n\nIn a statement given to Wired in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, a Venmo spokesperson said: “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists — and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.”\n\nIncredibly simple for us? Maybe. Incredibly simple for members of the Trump administration? Apparently not.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The talk of Major League Baseball’s opening weekend was the New York Yankees’ bats, and \"bats\" here isn't a figurative way to talk about the insane 36 runs off 34 hits, including 15 homers, the team notched in their first three games. Instead, the conversation is focused on the literal shape of the bats some on the Yankees used to produce those eye-popping numbers.\n\nThe conversation is focused on the shape of the bats some on the Yankees used to produce those eye-popping numbers.\n\nThe Yanks seem to have created an edge by — gasp — innovating. Several of their stars (notably excluding Aaron Judge, who leads the team in hits, home runs, on-base percentage, RBIs and batting average) are swinging a so-called torpedo bat, which uses a manufacturing tweak to shift some of a traditional bat’s mass a few inches in toward the batter. Instead of the bats we’re used to seeing that are skinny on one end and heavy on the other, these bats look flatter because more of their mass is concentrated in the zone most likely to make contact with a pitch, theoretically giving hitters more power without changing anything else.\n\nEarly results say the Yankees’ scheme is working: They’re undefeated through three games, having outscored the Milwaukee Brewers 36-14 in their opening series.\n\nAnd now, the question being asked in the sports-talkosphere is “Are the Yankees cheating?” Is changing the shape of a baseball bat the same as corking one, which once earned Sammy Sosa a suspension? Does it line up with players’ using performance enhancing drugs, signal stealing or pitchers’ tampering with a ball?\n\nMLB’s rules, at least at this point, say no. Each team is responsible for supplying its own bats, and beyond restrictions governing diameter and length — a bat can be no more than 2.61 inches at its thickest part and no longer than 42 inches —teams appear to be free to tinker with the lumber. But until now, no team has — at least not to any great effect.\n\nIt may not technically be cheating, but it’s hard to view the Yankees’ subterfuge as consistent with baseball’s enduring — but no less phony — mythology as a game for purists in which even minor innovations risk sullying the game. This is the same sport that long after yielding the mantle of “America’s Pastime” to the NFL still refuses to approve the use of an electronic strike zone and greenlit instant replay only this millennium, the last of the big four American sports leagues to do so.\n\nIt’s the same sport that egregiously shuns Barry Bonds, the best player of his era and the king of sending balls out of the park, because he’s been suspected of having used performance-enhancing drugs, even though MLB looked the other way and raked in profits as Bonds’ home runs boosted ratings.\n\nThe Yankees, in particular, help drive baseball’s cornball myth-making. There’s a rich irony in a team that won’t put players’ last names on their jerseys and didn’t until this season allow those players to wear beards modifying their bats — even if legally. The Yankees are perhaps baseball’s poster child for propping up its aggressive nostalgia by resisting innocuous changes. But here they are, messing with the bat, of all things, to their advantage on the field.\n\nIs nothing sacred?\n\nApparently not. MIT-trained physicist Aaron Leanhardt, whom the Yankees hired for their coaching staff in 2022, reportedly created the torpedo bats. Leanhardt jumped to the Miami Marlins in the offseason, but not before his bats were put into use by the Yankees last year. The Yankees aren’t the only ones. Players with the Cincinnati Reds, the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox, the Toronto Blue Jays, the Baltimore Orioles and the Tampa Bay Rays have reportedly either used the bats in game or tried them out.\n\nAs long as MLB holds that torpedo bats are all good, every team has an incentive to use them. That wouldn’t be the worst thing for a sport with a shrinking audience.\n\nSo, what should baseball do? As long as MLB holds that torpedo bats are all good by the rulebook, every team has an incentive to use them. That wouldn’t be the worst thing for a sport with a shrinking audience that all but guarantees that small market teams struggle to field competitive rosters. The Pittsburgh Pirates, for example, have the most exciting young pitcher in the sport in ace Paul Skenes, but their paltry $88 million payroll is less than a third of the Yankees’ $288.1 million in salaries this season, according to Spotrac.\n\nWith Judge and the rest of the pinstripes visiting PNC Park this weekend, why shouldn’t the Pirates try to even the odds with some torpedoes of their own?\n\nIf baseball ever hopes to reclaim its share of fans’ imaginations, it just might want to look the other way on this one, too.",

        "content": "Trailing $1 million checks, Elon Musk descended on Wisconsin on Sunday night as part of his final bid to buy Tuesday’s state Supreme Court race and solidify his positions as MAGA’s enforcer and kingmaker.\n\nDespite his almost nonexistent relationship with the Badger State, Musk has put himself at the center of the campaign that will determine control of the state’s high court — dumping in at least $20 million, according to The Associated Press, to elect a Trump-friendly candidate — making it the most expensive judicial campaign in American history. Despite warnings that it might be illegal, Musk handed out two checks for $1 million each to voters who had signed his petition against activist judges. (State courts had turned down efforts by the state’s Democratic attorney general to block the handouts.)\n\nDespite his almost nonexistent relationship with the Badger State, Musk has put himself at the center of the campaign that will determine control of the state’s high court.\n\nFor Wisconsin, the stakes are monumental: A win by conservative Brad Schimel over liberal Susan Crawford would flip control of the seven-member court, which now has a 4-3 liberal majority, with consequences for the fate of abortion rights, as well as redistricting.\n\nBut the vote is also important for Musk, who has effectively made the contest a referendum on himself and his DOGE crusade.\n\nSunday night, during an elaborately choreographed rally in Green Bay, the world’s richest man cast the Wisconsin vote in near-apocalyptic terms. The outcome will determine who “steers the course of Western civilization,” he declared. “I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”\n\nVictory in this crucial swing state would be wind beneath Musk’s wings. Republicans would read it as an endorsement of DOGE, and it would quiet growing GOP anxiety about the unpopularity of that agenda. For Musk, it would be definitive evidence of his political clout.\n\nDefeat, on the other hand, would be seen as a humiliating setback for both Musk and President Donald Trump.\n\nUnderstanding the stakes, Musk has flooded Wisconsin with cash and paid volunteers who are knocking on doors and trying to persuade low-propensity Trump voters to turn out Tuesday for Schimel. He’s all-in — and he has taken Trump with him. (Trump has endorsed Schimel but not campaigned here on his behalf.)\n\nEven though the race is technically nonpartisan and judges are supposed to be apolitical and independent, almost every piece of literature supporting Schimel features pictures of Trump. One flyer by a Musk-backed Super PAC declares: “Conservative Brad Schimel will support President Trump’s agenda!”\n\nAs part of their effort, a Musk-backed group has also posted fake pro-Susan Crawford ads implying she’s a woke progressive.\n\nIn turn, Democrats have made Musk’s attempt to buy the election a centerpiece of their campaign — accusing Schimel of selling himself to the billionaire. They have also pointed to Schimel’s devotion to the Republican president. Schimel — a judge in Waukesha County — told a group of Turning Point USA activists last month that Trump needed “a support network around him.”\n\nEarly voting has already set records, and because this is Wisconsin, the race is likely to be close.\n\n“They filed over 70 lawsuits against him since he took the oath of office barely a month ago, over 70 lawsuits to try to stop almost every single thing he’s doing because they don’t want him to get a win,” Schimel told the group. “They’re so desperate for him to not get a win that they won’t let America have a win. That’s what they’re doing. The only way we’re going to stop that is if the courts stop it. That’s the only place to stop this lawfare.”\n\nEarly voting has already set records, and because this is Wisconsin, the race is likely to be close. A poll by Marquette’s Law School in early March found that many voters were unfamiliar with the actual candidates. But the same poll found deep skepticism over the scope and speed of the DOGE spending cuts. And while Trump’s approval rating was 48% favorable to 51% unfavorable, Musk himself was further underwater. Only 41% of Wisconsin voters viewed the mogul favorably; 53% had negative impressions.\n\nAs for Wisconsin voters who have been enduring a tsunami of spending on the court race: The state will have elections for the Supreme Court every year now, for the next six years. Each election could flip control of the court.\n\nSo whatever happens Tuesday won’t be the last word. By a long shot.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza on March 18, Amna Asfour, a 36-year-old mother of four in Khan Younis, was jolted awake by a deafening explosion. “My son clung to my arm and whispered, ‘Mama, is it starting again?’” she recounted. During the brief pause in attacks following the January ceasefire, she had dared to hope that her children might sleep without fear. But reality set in quickly that night. “I tell them again: Sleep in your shoes. Keep your bag by the door, though I don’t know where else to go after we’ve already fled four times.”\n\nIn Gaza, the expectation of devastation is as constant as breathing.\n\nFor 15 months, Palestinians in Gaza have endured relentless bombardment, starvation and displacement. When a ceasefire finally arrived on Jan. 19, it merely offered a brief, fragile pause to bury the dead, tend to the wounded, and cling to the remnants of life before it was disrupted. In Gaza, the expectation of devastation is as constant as breathing.\n\nI covered the first phase of this war from the ground before I fled Gaza for my family’s and my safety. Now, reporting from Cairo as airstrikes continue to fall with unimaginable intensity, I see that for those still on the ground, there is no safety or calm, only the certainty that every lull is merely the prelude to even more destruction.\n\nEven with reports of a new ceasefire deal on the horizon, this latest return of airstrikes has felt more like a confirmation that no pause will ever lead to lasting peace. And the deepening psychological toll — a burden that now rests on the ashes of over a year of agony and terror — means the fear of death or injury has become secondary to the slow erosion of hope.\n\nBy the weekend, more than 750 people had been killed — most of them women and children — while hundreds more were wounded. After Israel broke the ceasefire, health officials reported the death toll in Gaza since the war began in October 2023 surpassed 50,000.\n\nFor Palestinian journalists, reporting on this war is both a professional duty and an act of survival.\n\nOn March 24, the IDF killed two more Palestinian journalists: Al Jazeera Mubasher correspondent Hossam Shabat and Palestine Today reporter Mohammed Mansour. Shabat was killed when his car was targeted in Beit Lahiya, while Mansour died in a bombing that struck his apartment in Khan Younis. The IDF confirmed both killings, claiming both journalists were terrorists. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the deaths and denied that claim, a spokesperson stating, “The deliberate and targeted killing of a journalist, of a civilian, is a war crime.” Al Jazeera had denied earlier claims that Shabat was a terrorist.\n\nTheir deaths add to the staggering toll of journalists and media workers killed in the war — more than 200 since October 2023, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate — as those who remain continue risking their lives to document the unfolding devastation.\n\nThe targeting of media workers in Gaza has been routine. Press vehicles, clearly marked as such, have been struck by Israeli forces, and shelters housing displaced civilians and journalists have not been spared. We’ve seen numerous reports of journalists being personally targeted and threatened by the Israeli military.\n\nDespite these relentless attacks, journalists in Gaza continue to do their job. Abdelhakim Abu Riash, a freelance photojournalist in northern Gaza, says he is “running out of places to report from — and of colleagues to report with.” But stopping isn’t an option, he says, “because then there would be no one to tell the world what’s happening.”\n\nSulaiman Hijjy, another photojournalist who has been reporting from Gaza, has grown accustomed to this grim reality. Since the airstrikes resumed less than two weeks ago, he found himself reliving the earliest days of the conflict. “For 15 months, I have filmed mass graves, bombed-out neighborhoods, entire families erased in a single airstrike,” he recalled.\n\nA freelance photojournalist in northern Gaza says he is ‘running out of places to report from — and of colleagues to report with.’\n\n“When the ceasefire came, I thought maybe I could breathe.” But there was no relief. Now, Hijjy files stories between airstrikes, capturing what remains of lives and landscapes before they, too, are erased.\n\nThe names of our fallen colleagues like Hossam, Mohammed and so many others before them should be voices that echo in newsrooms, not carved into gravestones.\n\nEven reporting from Cairo, the images of death don’t haunt me as a distant horror; they are a daily reality for me and thousands who remain in Gaza. They remind me that even as I report, I am also mourning. Documenting all of this means standing at the edge of life and loss, and continuing to write even when the world reads our words yet refuses to act. Carrying out this work is to ask, time and again, whether anything we say will ever be enough to break the world’s indifference.\n\nJournalists aren’t the only ones fighting for life and dignity in Gaza. Dr. Yasser Shami, a surgeon at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, described the nearly impossible conditions of providing care in a hospital stripped of resources. “For two months, we tried to prepare,” he recalled. “We had no real supplies, but at least patients weren’t pouring in every minute.”\n\nThe current situation in his hospital’s emergency room is even “worse than before,” he says. He recently had to amputate a 9-year-old boy’s leg with no anesthesia. He says the “little boy screamed until he passed out,” before he moved on to the next patient. “I don’t think we’re even allowed the time to grieve here,” he said.\n\nEach day, Shami faces impossible choices: who receives the last dose of antibiotics, who gets the only available ventilator, who might have a chance with urgent care, and who is already beyond saving. There is no proper triage — only a cruel calculus of survival dictated by scarcity.\n\nAccording to a United Nations report from last December, 136 Israeli strikes on hospitals in Gaza pushed the health care system to the brink of collapse. This dismantling of Gaza’s health infrastructure means that even those who survive the bombs may not survive their wounds.\n\nMedics, surgeons and journalists alike continue to press on, despite ongoing bombardments and the dimming prospect of lasting peace.\n\nEvery day, those journalists who have managed somehow to survive pick up their cameras, notebooks and microphones, even when they know they could be next.​ We grieve for those we’ve lost, yet we dare not stop — we owe it to them to keep telling the stories of those who can no longer speak for themselves.",

        "title": "The CDC's reported hire for a study on autism and vaccines is discredited",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring a researcher to study the widely debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. And that person is reportedly one of the chief disseminators of misinformation about a purported link between vaccines and autism in America.\n\nWith this hire, anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Health and Human Services Department is dealing a blow both to public faith in vaccine safety and to the credibility of the federal government’s public health guidance, by turning what should be a technical, evidence-based institution into overtly political terrain.\n\nI cannot be certain what David Geier will find in this dubious study, but his track record is about as damning as it gets.\n\nNBC News, citing two sources familiar with the plan, reports that the CDC is expected to hand over multiple sets of vaccine safety data to a “senior data analyst” at HHS named David Geier. NBC News reports that Geier and his father, Mark Geier, are “researchers known for their poorly designed and retracted studies using government safety data that have long fueled widespread misinformation about vaccines.” Among other things, the father-son duo claimed at an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004 that CDC data showed vaccines were linked to autism — and the claim was “refuted by scientists at the meeting and in scores of published studies since,” NBC reported. NBC News said that neither HHS nor Geier responded to requests for comment.\n\nThough Mark Geier has testified in scores of court cases involving vaccines, his testimony has consistently been rejected as irrelevant in legal settings. According to The New York Times, in 2003 a judge ruled that Geier was “a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience.” Other judges have called Geier’s testimony “intellectually dishonest” and “wholly unqualified,” The Times reported.\n\nBoth Geiers have records of unethical behavior. Per NBC News, they have “promoted an unproven treatment for autism that cost families tens of thousands of dollars and included injections of Lupron,” and “diagnosed kids with precocious puberty without proper tests and misled parents into thinking they were signing up for an approved autism therapy.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the Maryland Board of Physicians suspended Mark Geier's medical license in 2011 “because he was treating autistic children with a drug considered dangerous for young people and not known to alleviate symptoms of the disorder,” and revoked it altogether the next year, saying \"he had misrepresented his credentials.\" And David Geier — who has no medical degree — was sanctioned for practicing medicine without a license by the Maryland Board of Physicians.\n\nI cannot be certain what David Geier will find in this dubious study, but his track record is about as damning as it gets. If I were Kennedy and I wanted to convince the country that — despite the massive record of debunking — there is still more research to be conducted on a possible link between vaccines and autism, I would hire someone with impeccable credentials, and not someone who has been tarred by a record of practicing without credentials and retracted studies.\n\nBut choosing Geier gives away the game: Kennedy wants someone who will confirm his priors and, should Geier make a new set of claims about vaccines causing autism, will give them the imprimatur of the CDC.\n\nThis is a harrowing development for public health in America. The commissioning of the study alone is enough to once again put this theory in the news and intensify increasing vaccine hesitancy — which is already having serious consequences. Should Geier use this opportunity to peddle more misinformation, that will be even worse, and it’s reasonable to expect it could intensify vaccine hesitancy even further.\n\nThere’s another longer-term cost here, which is that the CDC will be seen as yet another arena for politicians to exploit to score points or push fringe ideas unsupported by evidence. The CDC is not infallible — consider the way it handled masking guidance during the first weeks of the Covid pandemic. But the CDC has corrected itself and generally held itself to high standards for evidence and rigor in scientific inquiry. Hiring noncredible anti-vaxxers should be seen as an attack on those principles — and Americans’ health.",

        "title": "Despite the Constitution, Trump says he’s ‘not joking’ about eyeing a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Over the course of the last decade or so, Donald Trump has demonstrated an affinity for laying rhetorical groundwork for some of his most radical tactics. Ahead of the 2020 election, for example, the president prepared to reject a possible defeat, so he spent months telling the public that the electoral process was illegitimate. Ahead of his many criminal indictments, he similarly invested time and energy into delegitimizing the legal process.\n\nThis strategy came to mind anew upon hearing the Republican talk about possibly pursuing a third term in the White House. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is prohibited by the Constitution under the 22nd Amendment, saying in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarifying that he was “not joking.” ... “A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a Sunday-morning phone call with NBC News, referring to his allies.\n\nTo be sure, the president’s comments on the subject came with some caveats — or at least comments that seemed like caveats. Trump said, for example, that it’s “far too early” to make any decisions about his electoral future. He similarly added that it’s “very early” in his second term.\n\nBut those comments didn’t negate the apparent fact that the incumbent, who is prohibited under the U.S. Constitution from seeking a third term — the 22nd Amendment says, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice” — is open to the possibility of at least trying to pursue a third term.\n\nIn fact, in his interview with NBC News, Trump was hardly subtle. “I’m not joking,” he said, adding that there are “methods” in which he could pursue such a goal.\n\nNBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nHours after the NBC News report reached the public, the president chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One and dodged a series of questions on the topic, though he claimed that “people” have asked him to run for a third term — which he said would be a fourth term “in a way” because his 2020 race was “totally rigged.” (It was not rigged; he lost fair and square, and he’s been lying uncontrollably about this for more than four years.)\n\nIf this broader rhetorical push sounds at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. Trump talked about pursuing a third term earlier this month. And last month. And the month before that. And the month before that. In fact, as regular readers might recall, Trump made a series of public comments about a third term during his first term.\n\nWhat’s more, a variety of White House allies, most notably media personality Steve Bannon, appear to be quite enthusiastic about what they perceive as a possibility — which, again, is not a possibility.\n\nI won’t pretend to know where this is headed or the degree to which the president is prepared to defy constitutional law. But Scott Cummings, a professor of legal ethics at the UCLA School of Law, made a comment on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on Friday that stood out for me.\n\nCommenting on autocracies around the world that have consolidated power, Cummings noted that in none of these countries “do leaders do all the things that Trump is doing, take aim at all of these independent institutions, and then just walk away.” Rather, the professor added, authoritarians take these steps because they intend “to stay in power permanently.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Pete Hegseth’s tenure as the secretary of defense was already a disaster before the Signal chat scandal broke last week, but the revelations from the controversy generated a great many calls from Capitol Hill for the Pentagon chief’s resignation.\n\nAs last week neared its end, however, things managed to go from bad to worse for the scandal-plagued former Fox News personality.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Friday, for example, that Hegseth tapped his younger brother, Phil Hegseth, to serve as senior adviser to the secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and liaison officer to the Defense Department — a title that has meant, among other things, a trip to Guantanamo Bay and traveling on the Pentagon’s 747 aircraft as the Cabinet secretary makes his first trip to the Indo-Pacific. The AP’s report added:\n\nIt’s common for the Defense Department and other federal agencies to have liaisons. Each military branch sends liaisons to Capitol Hill. The Pentagon, State Department and others all use interagency liaisons to more closely coordinate and keep tabs on policy. But it is not common for those senior-level positions to be filled by family members of the Cabinet heads....\n\nDespite Hegseth’s apparent preoccupation with merit-based employment decisions, his younger brother received a position of influence at the Pentagon despite a background as the founder of a podcast production company.\n\nAround the same time, The Wall Street Journal published another report about the defense secretary that raised eyebrows:\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is facing scrutiny over his handling of details of a military strike, brought his wife, a former Fox News producer, to two meetings with foreign military counterparts where sensitive information was discussed, according to multiple people who were present or had knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe Journal’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that a Defense secretary “can invite anyone to meetings with visiting counterparts, but attendee lists are usually carefully limited to those who need to be there and attendees are typically expected to possess security clearances given the delicate nature of the discussions.”\n\nHegseth’s latest wife doesn’t work for the Pentagon and there’s no public reporting about her having a high-ranking security clearance. (Hegseth’s spokesperson was offered a chance to respond to the reporting, but he declined, saying that he believed the report would include “inaccuracies” that he did not identify.)\n\nThe reporting from the AP and the Journal dovetailed with a Politico report that said while Donald Trump has expressed public support for Hegseth, “behind the scenes, administration insiders are starting to express doubts about the Pentagon chief’s judgment.” CNN had a related piece that said, “Interviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth’s leadership at the Pentagon.”\n\nTaken individually, the revelations about his brother’s job and his wife’s access are certainly important in their own right. But let’s not overlook the story behind the stories: It appears increasingly obvious that there are some people at the Pentagon who’ve learned some unfortunate things about Hegseth, and they’re suddenly eager to share that information with journalists.\n\nOr put another way, two months into Hegseth’s tenure, he’s generating the kind of chatter that his respected and qualified predecessor didn’t have to worry about at the department he ostensibly leads.\n\nIt’s a problem for the Pentagon chief that there’s evidence of his incompetence, abuses and failures, but it’s just as notable a problem that there are DOD insiders who are apparently willing to talk to reporters about his incompetence, abuses and failures.",

What are the most toxic antisemitic tropes? Well, “Jews control the institutions.” This is absolutely reinforcing this. Any young American is going to think: Remember what happened when they took down the world’s greatest university system on behalf of Jewish safety? And this will go down in history books — the history of this era will say that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism. So if we don’t speak out, if we American Jews do not speak out against this, this will be a grim chapter in our history as Americans. It’s the first time in my life as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans — not because of the protests on campus, which, as I said, had a lot of Jewish students in them. But because we are suddenly at the center of U.S. politics. It’s never good to be in the crosshairs for us. And we are being used to destroy democracy.\n\nDylan Williams, the vice president for government affairs at the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank, agreed.\n\n“This is exactly right and I have no doubt that it is how the overwhelming majority of Jewish Americans feel — we are being exploited in an attack on democracy, rights and the rule of law,” Williams wrote on X.\n\nThis concern isn’t confined to Jewish leftists. In fact, conservative writer Nick Cohen essentially warned about what we’re seeing now back in December. In an article for The Jewish Chronicle headlined “American Jews, beware of being used by Trump,” he wrote:\n\nThere’s an old saying that antisemitism is never really about Jews. Everyone from European fascists to today’s Khomeinists, for example, uses anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to justify the denial of human rights to their own citizens. The same applies to the philosemitism of the Trump movement. It wants to use American Jews — most of whom still vote Democrat, I should add — as an excuse to undermine their political opponents in liberal universities and abolish the US Education department.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Stern, the director of Bard College’s Center for the Study of Hate and a lead drafter of the working definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, recently told NPR that the Trump administration’s campus crackdown risks scapegoating Jewish students, as well.\n\n“It puts pro-Israel Jewish students in a situation where they may be seen as trying to suppress speech rather than answer it,” Stern said.\n\nAs NPR noted, the administration has adopted Stern’s definition of antisemitism in its executive orders — but he says the definition is being distorted and weaponized.\n\nThese concerns, about purported allyship’s being used in ways that ultimately may undermine Jews, mirror what some Asian Americans expressed as conservatives were using their communities to argue against — and do away with — race-conscious admissions on college campuses.\n\nNeedless to say, members of more than one marginalized group have shown wariness about the MAGA movement’s claiming to act on their behalf. And they have ample reason to feel that way.",

        "content": "By all appearances, when the White House dispatched an uninvited delegation to Greenland, the move was intended to be a charm offensive of sorts. Vice President JD Vance, his wife and his colleagues hoped their visit to the island — which Donald Trump is apparently determined to acquire — would make a good opening impression with locals.\n\nIf that was the goal, the administration failed quite spectacularly. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, officials in Greenland made a series of efforts to make clear that they did not want the U.S. delegation to be there, and as part of his visit, Vance took the opportunity to publicly and needlessly admonish Denmark — a reliable NATO ally for many years.\n\nThe Republican, as part of a press conference at a U.S. military base, added, “The president has said clearly he doesn’t think military force is going to be necessary, but he absolutely believes Greenland is an important part of the security, not just of the United States, but of the world and, of course, the people of Greenland, too.”\n\nThe word “but” did a lot of work in that sentence.\n\nThe circumstances were, by any fair measure, ridiculous. The American vice president took a sojourn to an island without an invitation, held a press conference on foreign soil, suggested the United States would acquire the island that does not wish to be acquired, and slammed a trusted ally that has done nothing wrong.\n\nA day later, his boss made matters worse with some fresh comments to NBC News.\n\nThe president on Saturday also said he has “absolutely” had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory. “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” Trump said. He added that there’s a “good possibility that we could do it without military force” but that “I don’t take anything off the table.”\n\nNote, it was a couple of weeks ago when Trump, while seated alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, predicted that he will ultimately succeed in his quest to take control of Greenland. “I think it’ll happen,” the president said when he asked what his vision is for the potential annexation of the island.\n\nAs part of the same set of comments, the American president also suggested that he might deploy additional U.S. troops to Greenland.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Republican White House had an opportunity to categorically reject the idea of using military force against an ally as part of Trump’s territorial ambitions. That clearly did not happen.\n\nA day after Trump effectively guaranteed that the United States would acquire Greenland, the island’s new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said via social media, “President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland.’ Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.”\n\nThe charm offensive, in other words, is off to a rough start.\n\nOf course, Trump’s idea isn’t just unpopular abroad, it’s unpopular in his own country, too: The latest Fox News poll asked respondents about various parts of the president’s agenda, and the least popular idea was taking over Greenland, with 70% of Americans opposed to the president’s plan.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "How Vance's comments in the Signal scandal undermine Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As he sized up a U.S. plan to strike Houthi militants in Yemen in March, Vice President JD Vance didn’t think such an aggressive move was a good idea — at least not now. The vice president’s initial comment in the Signal chat that has gotten so much attention this week was that such a strike would be “a mistake.”\n\nAmong other things, he didn’t think the American public would understand why we were doing it and worried that it might cause oil prices to spike. In that message, he wrote:\n\n3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth responded by arguing that the strike wouldn’t even be about the militants the U.S. sought to kill. Instead, it was about signaling American power to the world.\n\nThough most of the commentary about the Signal group chat this past week has focused on the accidental inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg — an outrageous breach of national security protocols — the scandal has also provided us an extraordinary window into Trump’s inner circle’s thinking about foreign policy strategy.\n\nIt underscores how farcical Trump's pledge to be president of \"peace\" and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be.\n\nWhat it reveals is a cavalier attitude toward new open-ended bombardment campaigns. And it underscores how farcical Trump’s pledge to be president of “peace” and focus narrowly on American interests has already turned out to be. Trump didn’t need to drop bombs on scores of sites across the poorest country in the Middle East now or with such intensity — and his whole team admitted it.\n\nVance was not wholly opposed to the strikes, but saw them as a deviation from a narrow focus on American interests. In some ways, he seemed to be holding the strictest interpretation of “America First\" principles in the chat. His thinking was why attack Houthi militants if doing so wasn’t that important for the U.S. economically, but could hurt U.S. consumers and politically hurt Trump?\n\nMultiple principals in the chat pushed Vance to adopt an expansive vision of U.S. national interests.\n\nHegseth argued, “This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause.” And national security adviser Michael Waltz contended: “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.”\n\nIn a later exchange Vance says he defers to the group but that he hates the idea of “bailing Europe out again.” Hegseth replies, “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”\n\nIn the discussion, Hegseth and Waltz represent a more traditional view of America as the world’s police officer. They’re saying this isn’t about defending the U.S. against the militants who are being targeted, and it isn’t about the U.S.’s own economic interests. Rather, it’s an intervention on behalf of U.S. allies and a pre-emptive signal to the U.S.’s nemesis in the region, Iran. It functions as a way “to send a message” about American geopolitical supremacy. It is the kind of argument that could easily be advanced by a Democratic liberal internationalist or a Republican neoconservative — both factions that some MAGA types have correctly lambasted as war hungry.\n\nWeeks after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel began its retaliation, Houthi rebels began launching missiles and drone attacks at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, citing Israel's bombing of Gaza and stating it wouldn't stop until “Israeli aggression stops.\" The Biden administration launched airstrikes against the Houthis in 2024, but that did not stop them. Rather, the Houthis announced a pause when Israel and Hamas struck a ceasefire deal. (In the meantime, many shipping companies have taken up routes avoiding the Red Sea, and after an initial rise in the price of shipping, those companies adapted and prices came down again this year.) Now, in light of Israel’s decision to torpedo the ceasefire deal and impose a starvation blockade on the entire population of Gaza — with Trump's blessing — the Houthis had warned that they would resume missile attacks. But they hadn’t yet. Multiple Pentagon officials told Military.com that the Houthis last launched an attack in December. In other words, Trump approved a pre-emptive strike, not a protective one; as Hegseth put it, the U.S. got to \"start this on our own terms.\" The U.S. has been carrying out such attacks on a daily basis since March 15 and released few details about them, and it’s unclear when they’ll stop.\n\nThese attacks have serious consequences for the civilian population of Yemen. Yemeni officials say the strikes have hit residential areas. Indeed, in the chat discussion in the aftermath of the strikes, Waltz appears to admit that the U.S. targeted civilian infrastructure. “The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote on Signal.\n\n“Excellent,” Vance replied.\n\nThe Yemen Data Project, an independent nonprofit that monitors attacks in the country, reports that it “recorded 53 civilian casualties in 38 U.S.-led strikes from 15 to 21 March.” And according to Military.com, citing two defense officials, the Trump administration is striking a broader range of targets than President Joe Biden did and harbors “less reluctance to hold off striking targets based on the casualties that may result.” All this is all happening in a war-torn, destitute country where most of the population is food insecure.\n\nThere's reason to be doubtful that these attacks will deter the Houthis. “The group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,” Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group, told The New York Times. Given that resilience, there’s not a lot of reason to believe that Trump’s apparently open-ended campaign will in fact make a huge dent using air power alone.\n\nAmerica First, as we’re coming to see in Trump’s second term, is not fundamentally about reducing conflict in the world; nor does it reflect a serious commitment to restraint. Since news of the Signal chat broke, Democrats and liberal commentators have slammed Trump’s national security team for discussing military plans on a chat that included a journalist. They’ve laughed at the misspelling of “principals” in the group chat, and derided those officials’ hokey use of prayer emojis in anticipation of the strikes. Granted, it was an idiotic and concerning lapse in security protocol. However an important part of the story isn’t just the lapse itself, but what it teaches us about how Trump’s inner circle sees the United States’ role in the world, and how that vision is contiguous with that of previous stewards of American empire. That this seems to have largely gone unnoticed speaks to how numb Americans have become to dropping bombs in the Middle East.",

Jeff Landry, Donald Trump Jr., rapper 50 Cent and other MAGA-aligned figures suffered a big loss Saturday when voters in the Bayou State rejected various amendments to the state constitution.\n\nLandry spent a large amount of political capital advocating for the four proposed amendments.

Perhaps most importantly, it would have “moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily,” the Louisiana Illuminator reported.\n\n50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had received some backlash for dropping a video endorsing the amendment.\n\n50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had received some backlash for dropping a video endorsing the amendment.

        "title": "Why Trump can't run for a third presidential term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” when he told NBC News on Sunday that his allies have been pushing him to run for a third term — but added that “it is far too early to think about it.” I disagree: It is not at all too early to think about whether and how a president who attempted to throw out an election loss to retain power wrongly attempts to stay in power into 2029 and beyond.\n\nThough Trump’s team routinely homes in on ambiguities in the law to find loopholes that let them run roughshod over our political norms, he’ll find that there’s no ambiguity in the 22nd Amendment, possibly the clearest limit on the presidency the Constitution imposes.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” it reads, “and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThere’s no foothold for any alternative reading of the language, and Trump’s usual wheedling and plotting to get around any limitations on him should instantly fall flat, far before it ever reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, again, the language of the 14th Amendment is very clear about banning insurrectionists from holding federal office. But when the Colorado Supreme Court cited that prohibition and ruled that Trump’s Jan. 6-related activities made him ineligible for that state’s ballot, the conservative U.S. Supreme Court helped Trump get around that constitutional roadblock.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued that three key phrases — “having previously taken an oath,” “as an officer of the United States” and “engaged in insurrection” — didn’t apply to Trump. They combined ahistorical arguments with bad faith readings of the text, and specific word choice was interrogated to within an inch of its life. The court’s opinion in Trump v. Anderson — issued unanimously — sidestepped his lawyer’s outlandish readings of the text and found that while states can use Section 3 to block state or local office-seekers from the ballot, they can’t block a federal candidate.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be much room for Trump to find a similar weak point in the 22nd Amendment, even if he demands that the Justice Department — which now includes several of the lawyers who helped keep him on the ballot last year — find a way for him to run again.\n\nUnlike the 14th Amendment, which was drafted over 100 years ago, the 22nd Amendment was written and ratified within some Americans’ living memory. There’s no mystery about what prompted its addition to the Constitution. In response to the outbreak of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to shatter the norm of U.S. presidents’ serving only two terms and ran for and won a third term. He then won a fourth presidential election in 1944, which shifted the politics of the issue dramatically.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law.\n\nCongressional Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats feared Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term stretch could start a trend. Even though World War II was fresh in their minds, they made no exception that allowed for a two-term president to run again if the country is at war. Notably, they also limited the number of times a vice president who assumed the presidency could run again.\n\nIf anything, the 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law. But despite the law’s being unequivocal, Trump told NBC News there “are methods which you could” use to seek a third term. He agreed that a hypothetical put before him would count, one in which he and Vice President JD Vance swap places on the ticket before Vance hands him back the top job.\n\nIn that, he seems to be taking inspiration from Russian President Vladimir Putin. After two terms, and barred from a third consecutive run, Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 2008, allowing Dmitry Medvedev to assume the presidency. Putin quickly changed his mind, swapping jobs back with Medvedev in 2012, and has remained president ever since.\n\nWhile I stand by my belief that Trump should have been disqualified from running again under the 14th Amendment, I can grudgingly admit that there were enough novel questions involved that Trump’s lawyers were able to craft a whole new subgenre of historical fiction in answering them. There is no such room for imagination in any case in which there’s even a possibility of Trump’s overstaying his term in office. The text of the 22nd Amendment is clearer than any past constitutional challenge he has instigated. And every judge he encounters is duty-bound to tell him so.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The sweet smell of baked sugar and butter filled my kitchen nearly every afternoon that spring of 2019. My son was in middle school and upping his cupcake game. He had perfected an Instagram-worthy icing method, in which he piped a channel of every color of the rainbow onto plastic wrap, then rolled it together and squeezed out a swirl of rainbow icing in a small mountain on top of perfectly baked cake. Then he planted a small flag with a friendly message about trans kids. His idea was to hand out cupcakes for Trans Day of Visibility. “I want to raise awareness, Mom,” he said. “I want people to know trans kids are just working on being themselves.”\n\n‘I want to raise awareness, Mom,’ he said. ‘I want people to know trans kids are just working on being themselves.’\n\nOn this Trans Day of Visibility, it’s jarring for me to recall how the same day felt then.\n\nThat year, in California, the ACLU was fighting on behalf of a trans man who’d been denied gender affirming surgery at a Catholic hospital on the day his procedure had been scheduled. I learned then that the hospital closest to my son’s school was run by a Catholic company.\n\nRaising my kids in a cozy Northern California town, I’d done my best to teach all of them how to treat others with respect, how to reach out to friends who were having a tough time on the playground, how to work with other kids with humor and lightness to help them see it wasn’t cool to pick on the weaker kids. They’d learned to have faith in kindness and learned that neighbors help one another live better lives. But I spent that cupcake spring wondering if I’d handed my trans kid a daisy for a gun fight.\n\nIn 2021, Arkansas became the first state to outlaw gender affirming care for minors. Now 26 states have. I expect most parents of trans kids feared Donald Trump being elected again and had a hunch about what to expect if he was, but the administration’s actions have been swifter and more concrete than we thought possible in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s executive orders opposing the participation of the trans community in American life are plainly rooted in bigotry and lies.\n\nMy son is in college now and doesn’t have much time for baking. He’s studying engineering and spent the last two weeks disassembling an antique typewriter to study the mechanics of joinery and levers. He’d like to someday work on a team that builds devices for people with mobility challenges. Some of the best companies doing this work are in other countries. To work abroad, or to even see what those companies are doing, he’ll need to use a passport.\n\nImagine the scene at the airport when a TSA official looks at the F on my son’s new passport and does a double take.\n\nFor years he’s had one that matches his identity. But when he renews it in a few months, because of an executive order Trump signed on this first day of this term, it will be returned from the State Department with the wrong gender marker. Imagine the scene at the airport when a TSA official looks at the F on my son’s new passport and does a double take. The flow of travelers through the line will stall. My son’s personal security will drift into precarity. What happens next, I’m not sure. What I do know is that no one, not one single person, will be better for this, and in fact many people — the security officials, delayed travelers and especially my son — will all be worse off.\n\nDespite the wintry chill felt by the trans community and many other communities targeted by Trump, spring is breaking through. Purple crocuses and buttercup-yellow daffodils punch skyward.\n\nMore than one friend has asked me how they can support my family, my son, the trans community on this Trans Day of Visibility. My suggestion is that we go back to the basics. I know I’m not the only mom in the United States who raised her kids to treat people with respect and to reach out to others who were struggling. I wasn’t the only mom who taught her kids that it’s not cool when bullies pick on those who are weaker. Even though I used to wonder if equipping my kids with kindness was leaving them unprepared for the fight against cruelty, it’s obvious to me now that simple kindness is a radical act, a powerfully subversive form of resistance.\n\nSo, on this Trans Day of Visibility, the job of allies is simple but not easy: be kind.\n\nOn this Trans Day of Visibility, the job of allies is simple but not easy: be kind.\n\nHere’s a place to start. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Keep an eye out for fellow travelers knowing their safety is partially in your hands. Check on friends and loved ones to see how they’re doing — knowing that many people are losing their health care coverage, their sense of belonging and their sense of safety. If you review passports at the airport or work as an administrator at the passport agency, hold on to your own convictions about what you think American citizenship is and should be. Do not be coerced into executing orders that require you to treat others in a way you would not want to be treated. Embrace the best of yourself.\n\nAnd make cupcakes.",

        "content": "A few weeks ago, Donald Trump’s Justice Department gutted the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, shrinking the unit that oversees prosecutions of public officials accused of corruption from dozens of employees to roughly six. A week earlier, the president’s DOJ also removed at least three top national security officials, gutting the National Security Division.\n\nOne day earlier, the president’s Justice Department also ousted lawyers managing its pardon work and bankruptcy litigation, as well as the official overseeing the Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles internal ethics investigations.\n\nDespite these steps, which helped destabilize federal law enforcement, Team Trump had not targeted career line prosecutors who oversee individual criminal cases — that is, until a few days ago. The New York Times reported:\n\nTwo longtime career prosecutors have been suddenly fired by the White House, in what current and former Justice Department officials called an unusual and alarming exercise of presidential power. In recent days, the prosecutors, in Los Angeles and Memphis, were dismissed abruptly, notified by a terse one-sentence email stating no reason for the move other than that it was on behalf of the president himself.\n\nAsked about the firings, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Times, “The White House, in coordination with the Department of Justice, has dismissed more than 50 U.S. attorneys and deputies in the past few weeks.”\n\nThat’s true, but it’s not something to brag about.\n\nJust so we’re all clear, when one presidential administration replaces another, it’s routine for a White House to replace U.S. attorneys with a new batch of prosecutors who oversee federal law enforcement offices. Barack Obama chose a slate of U.S. attorneys to replace George W. Bush’s prosecutors; Trump replaced Obama’s; Joe Biden replaced Trump’s; and so on.\n\nBut these new developments are qualitatively different. From the Times’ report:\n\nThe ousters reflected a more aggressive effort by the White House to reach deep inside U.S. attorney offices across the country in a stark departure from decades of practice. While it is commonplace and accepted for senior political appointees at the Justice Department to change from administration to administration, no department veteran could recall any similar removal of assistant U.S. attorneys.\n\nThe fired prosecutors, who were ousted without warning, were career officials with extensive experience. If there’s any evidence that the two lawyers, Adam Schleifer and Reagan Fondren, deserved to be ousted for cause, the White House and the Justice Department have kept that information to themselves.\n\nThat said, Schleifer was working on a case involving a Trump donor.\n\nLeavitt added, in response to questions about the firings, “The American people deserve a judicial branch full of honest arbiters of the law who want to protect democracy, not subvert it,” which might’ve made slightly more sense if federal prosecutors were part of the judicial branch, but they’re not. (Prosecutors are part of the executive branch.)\n\nIf you’re thinking that developments like these are likely to have a chilling effect, signaling to other career line prosecutors that the Republican White House is both watching and willing to take dramatic steps to rein in those who work in a U.S. attorney’s office, you’re not alone.",

        "content": "Philadelphia has its share of die-hard sports fans and, with a recent move, one young boy may have cemented his status among the most ardent fans.\n\nAs, even at the young age of 7-year-old, you might be hard pressed to find a more dedicated Phillies fan than Jackson.\n\nThe Shriners Children’s Hospital shared Jackson’s story, explaining that the young Phillies fan was born without a left arm and has gone without a prosthetic arm until recently.\n\nAnd, when the opportunity came to design the arm, Jackson wanted to share his love of the Phillies by getting the prosthetic covered in the team’s logo.\n\n7-year-old Jackson is a huge Phillies fan and he just got a prosthetic armed, covered in Phillies logos, from Shriners Children’s Hospitals. Shriner's Children's Philadelphia\n\n“I love my prosthetic, this is my baby,” Jackson said in a statement. “I want to wear it everywhere I can. I’ve been working on things like holding a piece of paper or opening a water bottle. My occupational therapist at Shriners Children’s, Jackie, is the sweetest person ever. I love working with her. We play fun games like Connect 4 that help me with my arm control. It’s great.”\n\nIn a statement, hospital officials said that Jackson chose that pattern for his first prosthetic because of his love for Phillies players like Alec Bohm and Bryce Harper.\n\nHe started care with Shriners Children’s when he was just eight-months-old, hospital officials said, and he only recently felt ready to try a prosthetic arm.\n\nHis mom, Stephanie, took him straight to Shriners Children’s where they custom-fitted and custom-made his prosthetic arm in the Pediatric Orthotic and Prosthetic Services (POPS) department, hospital officials said.\n\nSince receiving his new arm, officials said, Jackson has been going to occupational therapy appointments to help build muscle on his left side and to get familiar with the prosthetic.\n\n“When I saw him open the water bottle for the first time, I cried,” Jackson’s dad said in a statement. “Just to be able to see him now have the ability to do something that we know has been a struggle for him for years was incredible. We can see him starting to get more comfortable with the arm and improve everyday using it. Shriners Children’s has been great in explaining everything about the prosthetic and helping him use it.”\n\nAnd, the hospital said, Jackson’s love of the Phillies runs deep. When he gets home from school, the Phillies connoisseur writes out the team’s lineup and then goes outside to reenact each of the batters coming to the plate, the hospital said in a statement.\n\nHe even makes sure this is done authentically, batting from the left or right hand side of the plate depending on the player and, officials said, he also announces each player as they step into the batter’s box with booming authority just as the Phillies’ stadium announcer does at Citizens Bank Park.\n\n“I love going to the Phillies games and seeing them hit home runs,” Jackson said in a statement. “I also love seeing the Phillie Phanatic, and the atmosphere at the game is crazy. When the players walk up to the plate, it’s really awesome to hear their walk-up songs and I sing along. After a big hit, it’s cool to see the guys cheer for each other. When they hit a home run, I’m just like, ‘Let’s go!’ as loud as I can.”",

And why some Danes are boycotting American goods.\n\nHere’s what to know today.\n\nWhat to watch in the first major elections of Trump’s second term\n\nVoters in Wisconsin and Florida will head to the polls today to vote in elections that could serve a referendum on the Trump administration — and Elon Musk — two months into the president's second White House term.\n\n→ In Wisconsin, the race for a state Supreme Court seat is the first major contest in a battleground since the 2024 election, no less in the state where Trump had his narrowest margin of victory. The race is between liberal candidate Susan Crawford, who has received the backing of the state and national Democratic Party organizations, as well as the financial support of a cadre of liberal billionaires; and Brad Schimel, who has the backing of Trump and Musk. The technically nonpartisan court’s 4-3 liberal majority hangs in the balance.\n\nMusk has taken center stage in this race, with the DOGE leader’s super PAC spending at least $15 million to boost Schimel, according to records, and Musk campaigning for Schimel in Wisconsin last weekend. Democrats and groups supporting Crawford have leaned heavily into attacking Musk in ads, on the trail and on social media and have accused him of “trying to buy” Schimel. Whether Democratic voters will turn out for an off-year race will also be a test of their strength, NBC News and MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki writes in an analysis.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\n→ In Florida, elections will take place to replace two Republicans, former Rep. Matt Gaetz who gave up his seat when he was unsuccessfully nominated to be Trump’s attorney general, and former Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now Trump’s national security adviser and last week claimed responsibility for adding a journalist to a Signal group chat with top national security leaders.\n\nIn Florida’s 1st District, in the Panhandle, the race to replace Gaetz is between state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis and Democrat Gay Valimont, who ran against Gaetz in November. In the 6th District, along the eastern coast, the race to replace Waltz is between Republican state Sen. Randy Fine and Democratic teacher Josh Weil. Republicans have raised concerns about this race, pointing to Fine’s lackluster fundraising and late ad spending.\n\nBoth Republican candidates in Florida’s races have Trump’s backing, with the president holding tele-town halls last week for them. But with expectations of lower voter turnout, the races in Trump’s territory could end up being closer than expected and serve as a test of Trump’s influence over his base and Democrats’ enthusiasm in the Trump era.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet today with House Republicans as Trump seeks to implement new tariffs and pass his policy agenda.\n\nas Trump seeks to implement new tariffs and pass his policy agenda.

Greg Derr / The Patriot Ledger via AP Pool file\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in a retrial for Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman whose sensational murder trial ended with a hung jury. Prosecutors are again trying to convict her in the 2022 killing of her boyfriend, John O’Keefe, a veteran Boston police officer. But the absence of Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case who was fired last month, will loom large this time around.\n\nIn Read’s first trial last year, prosecutors alleged Read drunkenly backed her Lexus SUV into him and left him for dead outside a police sergeant’s home. Read’s defense team claimed O’Keefe was actually fatally beaten during the afterparty at the home of the police sergeant and that Read was framed for the killing in a conspiracy that involved other law enforcement officers. The defense also accused Proctor of manipulating evidence and leading a biased investigation, pointing to vulgar text messages he sent, as well as his undisclosed ties to the police sergeant.\n\nNow, Proctor’s dismissal between trials — and his possible appearance if he is called as a witness — will be one of the most watched aspects of the retrial.\n\nThe next big thing in baseball?\n\nJazz Chisholm Jr. of the New York Yankees goes to bat during the sixth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers on March 30.

By adding mass on a part of the bat that would normally result in weak contact, the intended result is a stronger and longer hit. Its role in the New York Yankees’ 15 home runs during the MLB’s opening week has sparked a debate about whether it’ll change baseball in the long run.\n\nSo far, the reaction is lukewarm. “This is just kind of the next step” in baseball technology, said former Yankees infielder Kevin Smith, “but we’ll see.” Meanwhile, California Institute of Technology president, quantum physicist and baseball fan Thomas Rosenbaum expects pitchers to adjust quickly, but regardless, “it’s a clever innovation.” Senior reporter David K.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A steady stream of money, advertisements and activity from national political figures has flowed into Wisconsin and Florida ahead of elections Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest race is for a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court, but a pair of congressional special elections in Florida have drawn attention, too. Voters in Wisconsin will also consider a race for state superintendent and a constitutional amendment on voter ID.\n\nHere are the key numbers to know that have shaped these elections.\n\nA deluge of TV ads\n\nThe vast majority of the $80 million-plus spent since Jan. 1 on TV in these off-year elections has been in Wisconsin, where the contest between state judges Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel has been the most expensive state Supreme Court race in history, surpassing the state's 2023 campaign.\n\nWisconsin has seen more than $70 million in TV ads on the court race (plus a bit more on other races on the ballot), according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Meanwhile, the special election in Florida’s 1st District has seen $3.4 million, and the one in the 6th District has seen $6.2 million through Election Day.\n\nSpending related to Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire White House adviser Elon Musk has played a major role in the uptick in spending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nMusk’s super PAC, America PAC, has spent $12.2 million and counting to boost Schimel. He also donated another $3 million to the state Republican Party. And he gave away million-dollar checks to petition signers at a recent event in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday’s elections.\n\nMeanwhile, another group with links to Musk, the nonprofit Building America’s Future, has spent $4.8 million in Wisconsin. (It’s unclear whether Musk is currently supporting that group.)\n\nThe biggest liberal-aligned group in the Wisconsin race has been A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent $8.4 million to benefit Crawford.\n\nMusk's America PAC has also gotten involved in Florida, but with far smaller sums, dropping nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the two races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nA lot of Musk X posts about Wisconsin\n\nMusk isn't just pouring money into the race; he's been talking a lot about it, too.\n\nHe has posted or reposted 73 times on X about the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this year, as of midday Monday. Most of those posts came in recent weeks, as his money and involvement in the campaign have become a central theme.\n\nMusk posted once about the race in January before sending a flurry of social media messages about the race in the last days of March.\n\nEarly voting\n\nEarly voting is up in Wisconsin compared with the state’s 2023 Supreme Court race, when about 453,000 people voted early or by mail ahead of Election Day. The question is: How many people will show up on Election Day, and what will total turnout look like?\n\nSimilarly, the campaigns in the Florida special elections are keeping a close eye on early turnout there, with one county demonstrating why some Republicans have been a bit nervous despite the strong GOP lean of the districts involved.\n\nIn Flagler County, Florida — the only unsplit county in Florida’s 6th Congressional District — Republicans account for 48% of early votes cast in the special election, virtually in line with Republicans’ 49% share of total registered voters in the county.\n\nBut Democrats are overperforming their registration in the early vote. While 24% of active Flagler County voters are Democrats, 36% of early voters are registered Democrats. It’s tricky to project anything final from early turnout numbers, but those voting numbers illustrate one reason why Democrats have done relatively well in special elections over the past few years: Their voters participate disproportionately in these contests.\n\nRepublican-leaning House districts\n\nThough Republicans have expressed some concern about Democrats' heavy fundraising in the Florida races, these districts are extremely red, giving the GOP candidates a lot of room for error.\n\nPresident Donald Trump carried the 6th District with 65% of the vote last November, and the 1st District with 68%. But Republicans still must convince their voters to turn out at an unusual time.\n\nA narrow House majority\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow 218-213 majority in the House, with four seats vacant (two won by each party in the 2024 election). Recapturing the Florida districts the GOP carried last year will give the party a slightly wider margin as Congress begins serious deliberation of how to advance Trump’s budget and tax proposals this year.\n\nWith two wins in Florida, House Republicans would be able to pass bills while losing three or fewer GOP members, if every member voted on the bill. At one point earlier this year, that margin for error was down to a single vote.",

        "content": "BANGKOK — Chinese rescuers have freed six people from the rubble of an earthquake in Myanmar, including a child and a pregnant woman, Chinese state media reported Monday, placing Beijing at the forefront of an international rescue effort from which the United States has been largely absent.\n\nRescue teams from India, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand and other countries have already arrived in Myanmar, where the military-led government says the death toll from a 7.7-magnitude earthquake Friday has surpassed 2,000, a figure that is expected to rise.\n\nBut a U.S. team has yet to appear at the scene of the quake in the Southeast Asian nation, which occurred the same day the State Department informed thousands of employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which administers civilian foreign aid, that nearly all of their roles were being eliminated.\n\nCritics have warned that President Donald Trump’s cuts to U.S. foreign aid, which had previously accounted for less than 1% of the annual federal budget, could create an opening for authoritarian governments such as China and Russia that are trying to increase their global influence.\n\nMuslims affected by the earthquake mark the end of Ramadan during prayers on the street in Mandalay on Monday. Sai Aung Main / AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Myanmar, one of the world’s poorest countries, said Sunday in a post on X that the U.S. would provide up to $2 million in aid through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organizations.\n\nThe embassy also said that a USAID emergency response team was “deploying to Myanmar to identify the people’s most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs, and access to water.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the U.S. team would arrive in Myanmar, even as the country Monday marked the end of the crucial 72 hours since the quake after which the survival rate of people trapped in the rubble sharply decreases.\n\nThe State Department said Monday that in the meantime, U.S. disaster experts in Bangkok, Manila and Washington are monitoring the situation in coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region.\n\n“I would reject the premise that the sign of success is that we are physically there,” spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\n\nThe U.S. absence is being felt on the ground in Myanmar, a country of 54 million people that, in addition to the earthquake, has been embroiled in a civil war for four years.\n\n“We’ve seen a broad cut in humanitarian aid, that’s undeniable,” Trevor Clark, UNICEF’s regional chief of emergency, told NBC News in Bangkok on Monday. “What we’re focused on right now is just the immediate stuff. We’ve been able to mobilize some internal resources, and we’re confident that other sort of partners will step up.”\n\nChina has announced $14 million in assistance for Myanmar, including 1,200 tents, 8,000 blankets and 40,000 first aid kits. A team of 118 Chinese rescuers arrived in the country Sunday along with six rescue dogs and two vehicles, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, in addition to 82 who arrived Saturday.\n\nVideo from the state-run broadcaster CCTV showed two Chinese rescuers pulling a 5-year-old girl from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building early Monday in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which was near the epicenter of the quake.\n\nThe girl was carried down in the claw of an excavator, while a pregnant woman rescued from the same building was carried out on a gurney hooked to a zipline, video from Xinhua showed.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has sent 20 rescuers, including dog handlers and drone operators, according to the Russian state news agency Tass, as well as three planes including an airmobile hospital.\n\nA Russian rescue crew gathering for a daily morning briefing in Mandalay on Monday. Russia Emergency Ministry press service via AP\n\nThe international response to the earthquake is complicated by the civil war, with the delivery of aid hampered by “damaged roads, collapsed bridges, unstable communications, and the complexities related to civil conflict,” the World Health Organization said Sunday.\n\nMyanmar’s military government, which seized power in a 2021 coup, tightly controls access to the country and has continued bombing rebel forces in the days since the quake even as the country is rattled by aftershocks. But it has also sought international help, inviting “any country” to provide assistance.\n\nThailand has sent a team to neighboring Myanmar even as it deals with its own casualties from the quake, which sent high-rises swaying in the Thai capital, Bangkok, hundreds of miles from the epicenter.\n\nRescue efforts in Bangkok are centered on a 30-story building under construction that collapsed in the quake, trapping scores of workers.\n\nOn Monday, rescuers recovered a 12th body from the wreckage of the building, out of the 19 people killed across the city. Nine people have been found alive while more than 70 others are still missing at the site of the building, where U.S. service members are working alongside the Thai military and other first responders.\n\nEven as rescue efforts continued for a fourth day, officials did not give up hope of finding more survivors. On Monday, Bangkok Deputy Gov. Tavida Kamolvej said life-detection equipment had found a weak vital sign under the rubble, prompting Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to leave the scene so rescuers could hear better.\n\n“Every second counts, it really counts,” Tavida said.\n\nNat Sumon, Ed Flanagan and Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Bangkok, and Mithil Aggarwal and Yixuan Tan from Hong Kong.",

All the major Hollywood studios make big presentations packed with film clips, trailers, and stars to make the case that their upcoming slate will lure audiences to theaters.\n\nSony also brought out Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle to debut the new trailer for “28 Years Later,” his long-awaited zombie apocalypse sequel to “28 Days Later,” which will hit theaters in June, and the team behind “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” to tease their third film in the Spider-Verse trilogy.\n\nCEO Tom Rothman encouraged movie theater owners to get creative with weekday discounts, and Sony executive Adam Bergerman advocated keeping films in cinemas for longer.\n\nThe convention comes fresh off an Oscars rallying cry for seeing movies in theaters.\n\nAlthough a fuller release schedule is expected this year compared to 2024’s depleted calendar thanks to dual historic strikes, Hollywood marked the first quarter of 2025 with a sizable box office deficit.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "During a long and widely watched trial last year, Karen Read was prosecuted for murder in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe.\n\nThe trial, which included allegations of police misconduct and of a wide-ranging conspiracy among law enforcement officers to frame Read in the killing, ended in a hung jury.\n\nJury selection in Read’s retrial on charges of second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death is set to begin Tuesday in a courtroom outside Boston.\n\nHere’s what to know about the case.\n\nHow did John O’Keefe die?\n\nO’Keefe, 46, had been a police officer for 16 years. He was found unresponsive on a snowy January morning outside the suburban home of Brian Albert, a now-retired Boston police sergeant.\n\nO’Keefe was pronounced dead shortly after, and the medical examiner attributed the cause to blunt force trauma to the head and hypothermia. Read, then an equity analyst who had been dating O’Keefe for two years, was arrested in connection with his death days later.\n\nKaren Read and John O'Keefe. via Dateline\n\nWhen Read was tried in 2024, the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office pointed to the couple’s troubled relationship as a possible motive in the killing and accused her of striking O’Keefe outside the sergeant’s home with her Lexus SUV after a night of heavy drinking.\n\nThe death was not captured on camera, and no eyewitnesses claimed to have seen what happened. But Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally told the jury that vehicle data from Read’s SUV showed her traveling backward for 60 feet at 24 mph outside Albert’s home around the time that she was dropping O’Keefe off at a party there.\n\nO’Keefe’s hair was found on the vehicle’s bumper, and his DNA was on the SUV’s broken taillight, Lally told the jury. The remnants of a cocktail he appeared to have left a bar with earlier that night were also found on the bumper, as were bits of what Lally described as a drinking glass.\n\nWhat did the defense say?\n\nRead asserted her innocence and her defense team accused Albert and others who’d been at the party — including an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whom Read had exchanged flirty texts with — of fatally assaulting O’Keefe and framing Read for the killing. (Albert testified that O’Keefe never came inside his home but that he would have been “welcomed with open arms” if he had.)\n\nThe defense also accused the lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, of manipulating evidence and conducting a biased investigation. Text messages introduced at trial showed Proctor using offensive and derogatory language to describe Read to family, friends and supervisors.\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor testified at the Read trial in June. Kayla Bartkowski / The Boston Globe via AP, Pool\n\nProctor had undisclosed ties to Albert and his family, Read’s lawyers said, and he shared investigative details with his sister, who was close friends with Albert’s sister-in-law.\n\nProctor acknowledged discussing the case with his sister, though he said he shared only “newsworthy stuff,” and he testified that his unprofessional language “dehumanized” Read. But he said his conduct did not compromise the integrity of the investigation into O’Keefe’s death.\n\nAfter a nine-week trial and five days of deliberations, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nDays later, the Massachusetts State Police placed Proctor on unpaid leave over what the agency described as allegations of “serious misconduct” raised at trial. The trooper was fired last month after a state police trial board examined the allegations and found that he had violated agency rules by sending derogatory and defamatory texts about Read and shared sensitive investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel.\n\nProctor also drank while on duty and drove his cruiser, according to the trial board’s findings.\n\nProctor has not publicly commented on his termination, but his family said the text messages “prove one thing, and that Michael is human — not corrupt, not incompetent in his role as a homicide detective, and certainly not unfit to continue to be a Massachusetts State Trooper.”\n\n“Despite the Massachusetts State Police’s dubious and relentless efforts to find more inculpatory evidence against Michael Proctor on his phones, computers and cruiser data, the messages on his personal phone — referring to the person who killed a fellow beloved Boston Police Officer — are all that they found,” the family said.\n\nSeparately, Read’s attorneys tried to have the case thrown out over claims that Read was the victim of “extraordinary governmental misconduct.” They also claimed her retrial amounted to double jeopardy because, after the mistrial, two jurors told the defense team that the panel would have acquitted Read of murder and leaving the scene of a collision causing death.\n\nProsecutors disputed those claims and judges have denied both claims.\n\nWhat will be different in a second trial?\n\nThe prosecution tapped Hank Brennan, a former prosecutor and longtime criminal defense attorney who represented Boston gangster James “Whitey” Bulger, to retry the case as special counsel and lead prosecutor.\n\nThe defense team also added a lawyer — Victoria George, who served as an alternate juror during the first trial. “I waited for nearly a year after the mistrial, hoping the court system would work as intended to remedy some of the wrongs in this case,” she told Vanity Fair magazine.\n\nIt isn’t clear what role Proctor will play. He has appeared on witness lists filed by both the defense and prosecution, but legal experts said that his termination adds a level of uncertainty to the proceedings.\n\n“At the time of his original testimony, he still had a job to rein him in,” Stara Roemer, a former Dallas County prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in Texas, told NBC News. “Now that he no longer has that job, who knows what could come out of his mouth.”\n\nAlso included on an amended witness list from the prosecution are three of Read’s attorneys — Alan Jackson, David Yanetti and Elizabeth Little.\n\n“It may be necessary to call defense counsels to authenticate the defendant’s numerous public statements,” prosecutors said in the filing, according to NBC Boston.",

        "content": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Widespread anger over the Trump administration’s push for U.S. ownership of Greenland is prompting shoppers in Denmark to boycott American products and services such as Tesla, Netflix and Coca-Cola.\n\nSupermarkets are making homegrown products more visible, cellphone apps are helping consumers work out where their purchases originate from, and Facebook groups have been set up offering tips on how to avoid American goods and services.\n\nAmong them, “Boykot Varer Fra USA” or “Boycott goods from the USA,” which has gained almost 93,000 members since it was set last month to protest President Donald Trump’s repeated suggestions that the United States should take over the Arctic territory.\n\n“We love the U.S. and the culture, but we just dislike the president,” one of the group’s co-administrators, Bo Albertus, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. He added that the Trump’s treatment of Greenland, which is part of Denmark, and has “a set of values that we do not share with Trump” was inspiring people to join the group, which has a crushed Coca-Cola can as its main image.\n\nAlbertus, who works at a school for children with autism in Albertslund, a suburb of the capital, Copenhagen, added that the group was working with a similar campaign in neighboring Sweden.\n\nOn both groups, users offer suggestions about alternatives to American products, such as locally made soft drinks, footwear or streaming services. Others have listed alternative burger chains and internet search engines. Many have taken inspiration from Canada where some people have been boycotting U.S. companies and products.\n\nProtesters wave Danish and Greenland flags during a demonstration in Copenhagen on Saturday. Thomas Traasdahl / Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Ima\n\nAware that the group had been set up on Facebook, an American social media company, he said the group was “building our own infrastructure and working on a newsletter” to avoid it.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, similar movements have sprung up, including “Le Boycott” in France, and “Tesla Takedown” protests, similar to those in the U.S., have taken place in the United Kingdom and Germany, along with several other countries.\n\nBut in Denmark, the anger is particularly acute after Trump’s repeated suggestions that the U.S. should take over Greenland, a vast, sparse island — around the size of Alaska and California combined but with only 56,000 people.\n\nTensions rose further after Vice President JD Vance suggested that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark in a speech Friday to American service members at the Pituffik Space Base in the island’s northwest.\n\nDenmark controlled Greenland for 300 years before it became a formal territory in 1953. Greenland gained home rule in 1979, although Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.\n\nPeople started to boycott American products after Trump’s inauguration, according to a March 1 survey by the market research firm Megafon for the Danish TV2 show. It found that every second Dane had refrained from buying American goods since then. And 1 in 5 also said they were less likely to visit the U.S.\n\nElon Musk’s Tesla appears to have been one of the companies hit. Sales of the company’s vehicles in Denmark were down by almost half compared with last year, according to auto industry experts Bilstatistik.dk. As has been the case in other countries, some Danish Tesla owners have adorned their vehicles with stickers saying, “Not a Elon Musk supporter.”\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. NBC News has also reached out to Netflix and Coca-Cola.\n\nOthers are switching out more basic items such as canned goods, cola drinks and potato chips, while some stores have started to highlight where their products originate from.\n\nSpar convenience store chain locations have marked items produced in Denmark with the country’s flag, and the supermarket chain Salling group, which has 1,700 stores dotted around the country, has marked products with a star if they originate in Europe.\n\nStressing that the stars were not a call for consumers to boycott American goods, Henrik Vinther Olesen, the Salling Group’s director of communication, said in an email Saturday that the stars were aimed at providing consumers with information about the origins of their products.\n\n“We are generally experiencing that customers shop like they usually do,” he added.\n\nA Tesla owner making their views of the automaker's owner clear. Sergei Gapon / AFP via Getty Images\n\nTwo Danes, Henning Madsen and Ian Feldt, have also developed the “Made O´meter” app which allows people to take photos of the goods they are buying so they can find out where the product originated from. However, it is currently paused because it labeled American goods as European.\n\nConsumers like Peter Kolby were also thinking longer term, particularly when it came to the tech they are using.\n\n“I don’t have a problem with American goods as such,” he said in a telephone interview Monday. But the 31-year-old from the island of Fyn said he asked himself what he would do if “Trump closed all American tech down for us overnight?”\n\n“When I hear this talk about Greenland, then I have to find alternatives to gmail, cloud, IOS, Microsoft,” he said, adding, “We have to be able to stand on our feet, as Trump has said. And that is what we are doing.”",

        "content": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs and overseeing the nation’s public health policies.\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is attempting to reduce the health department’s workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 across several agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe drastic job cuts are part of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s wider plan to reshape the federal public health infrastructure.\n\nThe administration made especially deep cuts to divisions responsible for tackling HIV, improving minority health and prevention from injury, such as gun violence. Communications offices were gutted, too: the entire team at the FDA’s office of media affairs was axed, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMost of the communications team of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research — about 50 people — was also axed, according to a senior staffer.\n\nThe office’s work included managing public databases on drug approvals, such as information about potential risks of FDA-approved drugs and labeling, which are required by law to be published. The office was also responsible for managing the drug shortages database.\n\nThe layoff notices that started going out late Monday and continued into Tuesday morning ended days of anxiety for many employees, some of whom said they spent the weekend wracked with worry about whether they still had jobs. (The notices did not go out Friday as originally planned so “all the data could be triple-checked over the weekend,” a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.)\n\nThe cuts hit divisions overseeing the approval of new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. Some divisions, including several focused on the safety of mine workers, were eliminated entirely.\n\nEmployees were encouraged to take their laptops home each evening, according to a memo obtained by NBC News, in case they were terminated overnight and lost access to the campus facilities. (They would still be expected to work remotely, the memo added.)\n\nAt the FDA, some employees who hadn't realized they'd been let go were turned away on campus by security Tuesday morning, one source said.\n\nIn total, HHS says its seeking to eliminate about 2,400 full-time jobs at the CDC, 3,500 jobs at the FDA, 1,200 jobs at the NIH and 300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nFederal health officials have said some departments that are eliminated or downsized may have their responsibilities shifted over to a newly created entity, the Administration for Healthy America, or AHA.\n\nAmong the agencies set to be folded into the AHA include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.\n\nThe mass layoffs are part of a larger plan by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reshape the federal public health infrastructure.\n\nOn Friday, Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccine regulator, was ousted — a move, experts say, will only increase the growing distrust in vaccines.\n\nMarks played a key role in authorizing and monitoring the safety of vaccines, including the first Covid vaccines in late 2020, as well as treatments like a cure for sickle cell disease that uses the gene-editing tool CRISPR.\n\n“The dismissal of Marks, a staunch advocate of access to promising research for patients and their families, shows that not only is Kennedy indifferent to science, he apparently is indifferent to those doing their best to fight for desperately ill children and families,” said Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson at HHS, has said the cuts will not affect Medicare or Medicaid services, nor the FDA’s review of drugs, medical devices and foods.\n\nAs of last week, no additional job cuts were planned by the agency.\n\nPublic health advocates and some Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized the sweeping cuts, saying they could jeopardize public health efforts.\n\nEarlier Monday, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., former chair of a Senate health committee that oversees the agency, along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about his plans to “gut” staff and reorganize HHS.\n\n“Authoritatively stating that these drastic changes will improve the health of Americans without any explanation insults the American public and defies logic,” the lawmakers wrote. “If these actions were actually intended to improve the Department’s ability to carry out its mission to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans, you and the Department should be eager to provide additional detail and justification for them.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "While Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, Democrats and Republicans have both picked sides and are pouring fortunes into their efforts. As the votes are tallied Tuesday night, the ability to claim political momentum amid the upheaval of President Donald Trump’s second term will be on the line.\n\nWhat is being tested, though, is not so much whether large numbers of voters have changed their minds in the five months since the presidential election. When it comes to Trump himself, Wisconsin is an especially polarized state, with three straight presidential elections decided by less than 1 point. More likely, the outcome hinges on whether the pro-Trump side has become more engaged in an election like this than it has been up to this point.\n\nThis is a clear advantage that Democrats have carved out in the Trump era. In stand-alone elections for lower-profile offices, in which turnout is far lower than in races for president or even governor, they’ve had the more motivated set of voters. This has been true in Wisconsin, where the Democratic-backed candidate won the most recent Supreme Court election in 2023 by 11 points. And it has been true nationally, where Democrats have posted a string of wins and overperformances in House special elections the last few years.\n\nThe energy isn’t coming from all corners of the Democratic coalition. Instead, it is concentrated among a largely white set of voters with high levels of education, higher incomes and intensely anti-Trump views. They are found in most abundance in college towns and metropolitan areas, but even in places where they are few in number, they’ve been punching above their weight in lower-turnout elections.\n\nOn the flip side, Trump in his three campaigns has generated surge turnout and support from blue-collar, white voters, predominantly in rural and small-town areas. Many of those voters had been on the political sidelines before Trump came along, while others had been voting Democratic. They’ve maintained strong loyalty to Trump but haven’t been as interested in low-profile contests like state Supreme Court races.\n\nTwo particular parts of Wisconsin capture this dynamic starkly and will loom large Tuesday night.\n\nDane County is some of the most demographically fertile ground for Democrats anywhere in the country. Home to both the state capital and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, it has — by far — the highest concentration of college-educated adults in the state. It’s also the fifth-wealthiest county in the state, and with nearly 600,000 residents, it's the second-most populous. And in lower-profile races like this one, its turnout levels have been the highest of any county.\n\nThen there’s what’s known locally as the \"Driftless Area,\" a largely rural and small-town swath that extends along and inland of the Mississippi River from the Iowa border to just south of the Twin City suburbs of St. Croix County. The name derives from a lack of glacial coverage tens of thousands of years ago, but politically, the Driftless Area is chock full of white, blue-collar voters who emerged in droves when Trump first ran for the White House in 2016. It is the cultural and political opposite of Dane County.\n\nNow consider what happened in the 2023 Supreme Court election. If we use last year’s presidential race as a benchmark, turnout in Dane County for the 2023 court race was 66% as high. That’s an astronomical sum given the office at stake. And the Democratic-aligned candidate won by 64 points, a much larger spread than Democratic presidential candidates typically enjoy in Dane.\n\nBy contrast, turnout in the 14 counties that make up the Driftless Area was only 51% of the presidential level, meaning that many of those voters who materialized for Trump simply didn’t take part. And without them, the Democratic-backed candidate actually won the Driftless Area, a throwback to the pre-Trump era.\n\nThat encapsulates the challenge for Republicans in Tuesday’s race: Have they found a way to reach pro-Trump voters in places like the Driftless Area and convince them that it’s a test of their loyalty to the president?",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Kenan Thompson is sharing his thoughts on Morgan Wallen’s abrupt exit after performing on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nThe country singer was the musical guest on the March 29 episode of “SNL” hosted by Oscar winner Mikey Madison. At the end of the show, when the “Anora” star was saying her goodbyes as the credits rolled, Wallen left the stage instead of chatting with the cast and greeting one another, as most other guests do.\n\nWallen’s actions drew strong reactions from viewers, including Thompson.\n\n“I don’t know what goes through people’s minds when they decide to do stuff like that. I don’t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way,” Thompson told Entertainment Weekly in an interview Monday.\n\nThe longest-running cast member said that he “definitely saw it” when Wallen abruptly walked off the stage. “You see somebody before you get a chance to say hi or say good job or anything like that, they just dipping.”\n\n“I thought maybe he had to go to the potty or something,” Thompson said. “It’s definitely a spike in the norm. We’re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody’s saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.’ So when there’s a departure from that, it’s like, ‘Hmm, I wonder what that’s about?’”\n\nThompson noted that he “never met” the “I’m The Problem” singer, but said he “seems like a complicated individual, I guess.”\n\nThe comedian also said that Wallen isn’t the only guest to previously leave so suddenly.\n\n“Prince did the same thing,” he said, adding, “I’m not saying Morgan Wallen is Prince, but we weren’t surprised because Prince was notoriously kind of standoffish. It’s just how he was. So we just thought like, ‘OK, now he’s gone back into fantasyland.’”\n\nHowever, he explained that Wallen’s actions were definitely felt by everyone on stage.\n\n“But Saturday I guess it was just different because it just felt so abrupt. And it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway,” he said. “So it was just like, oh wow, that was pretty visible. You know what I’m saying? It was a pretty visible thing.”\n\nAdding to Wallen’s actions was the artist’s post on his Instagram story. Wallen posted a photo of a private jet on a tarmac with the words, “Get me to God’s country.”\n\nOn Sunday, TODAY.com reached out to Wallen’s representatives for comment and clarification on his post but did not hear back.\n\nThompson, on his end, said that Wallen’s post was “strange” and didn’t understand why he posted it.\n\n“The ‘God’s country’ of it all is strange because it’s like, what are you trying to say? You trying to say that we are not in God’s country? We’re not all in God’s country? We’re not all under God’s umbrella? That’s not necessarily my favorite,” he told EW. “But whatever. Moving on, we got a new show. We got Jack Black this week ... We will be fine.”\n\nWallen has yet to address the reaction to the way he made his “SNL” exit. The singer, however, has a history of controversy that also includes the comedy sketch show.\n\nIn October 2020, he was cut as the musical guest after breaking Covid-19 protocols and was seen partying without a mask ahead of his scheduled gig. Wallen was able to rebook his spot in a December show and joked about his canceled performance in a sketch.",

Houske, who had survived her first heart attack only a year earlier, was worried she was experiencing a second.\n\nWhen Houske arrived at a local emergency room by ambulance, she hoped for compassionate treatment. Instead, her doctor appeared cold and kept his distance, standing in the doorway without ever entering her room, Houske said.\n\nAn imaging technician ignored how much pain she was suffering and shouted at her, Houske said. Rather than help her out of the scanner, the technician barked at her to climb out of the machine herself.\n\nKelly Houske, 67, said she has been mistreated by health care providers on many occasions. Courtesy Kelly Houske\n\n“I was in so much pain I could hardly move,” said Houske, 67, whose back pain was later found to be caused by kidney stones. The technician “kept saying, ‘Come on, come on, come on,’” she recalled. “He didn’t offer to help.”\n\nWhen Houske tried to stand on her own, she crumpled to the ground.\n\nThe tech stood over her impatiently, Houske said, but didn’t help her off the floor. “Eventually, someone else came into the room and helped me get up,” she said.\n\nThe 2017 encounter at a Tennessee hospital was one of many instances in which Houske, who is transgender, said she has been mistreated by a health care provider. Surveys show that mistreatment of trans patients is common — including verbal harassment or refusal of care — sometimes leading them to delay or avoid seeking care.\n\nMany advocates for transgender people say they fear treatment of trans patients will suffer further under President Donald Trump, who has issued a slew of executive orders in recent weeks restricting transgender rights, including several that seek to limit access to transition-related health care.\n\nIn a report published in Psychiatric News last month, physicians who work with transgender patients said the executive orders have led to widespread distress among their trans patients.\n\nAnd according to a report released last month from the UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute, an LGBTQ think tank, almost three-quarters of trans patients surveyed after the presidential election said they are concerned that the quality of their health care will decline under Trump. About 80% of respondents, who were surveyed before Trump took office, said they planned to make changes to their behavior, appearance or speech to downplay visibility as transgender people. One-third said they were socially isolating and avoiding public places and activities.\n\nShawn Reilly, a transgender community organizer in Nashville, Tennessee, said he is concerned that Trump will roll back protections for trans patients established by the Obama and Biden administrations. Reilly said they fear health providers will be allowed to withhold care from trans patients.\n\n“Stripping transgender people and all sexual and gender minorities of protections while they are trying to access a basic human right — health care — is inhumane and unjust,” said Reilly, a former coordinator of the “trans buddy” program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, which provides trained advocates to accompany transgender patients on medical visits.\n\nNeither the Department of Health and Human Services nor the White House responded to requests for comment about the concerns of transgender people, along with their health care providers and advocates, about their treatment in health care settings.\n\nTargeting transgender people\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump issued a policy that reversed an Obama-era nondiscrimination rule for transgender patients.\n\nAlthough Trump hasn’t yet issued a new rule on health care discrimination, a web page created by the Biden administration, which explained legal protections for transgender patients, is now blank.\n\nTrump’s actions in the first months of his second term have raised alarms, Reilly said.\n\nIn one of his first acts after he was inaugurated, Trump issued an executive order that denies legal recognition to transgender people. The order says that “it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable.”\n\nThe word “transgender” has disappeared from government websites, although some deleted web pages have been restored because of a court order. Trump has also canceled research grants for projects related to transgender health.\n\nAs part of the effort to fight what Trump calls “gender ideology,” the Department of Veterans Affairs said last month that it will phase out coverage of gender transition care for veterans.\n\nThrough additional executive orders, Trump has tried to restrict access to gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19, ban trans people from serving openly in the military, ban trans athletes from women’s sports, require incarcerated trans women to be held in men’s prisons and eliminate protections for trans students in elementary and secondary schools, such as allowing them to use the bathrooms of their choice.\n\nAdvocacy groups have challenged many of Trump’s executive orders in court. Federal judges have issued temporary restraining orders on the gender-affirming care ban, the prison order and his ban on trans people enlisting or serving in the military.\n\nLegal protections in flux\n\nLegal protections for transgender patients are grounded in the Affordable Care Act, which bans discrimination in medical settings and health insurance based on race, color, national origin, age, disability and sex. People who have faced illegal discrimination can file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services, which can withhold federal funds from institutions found to have violated the law.\n\nEvery president has interpreted the law differently, however. While Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden issued rules stating that the ban on sex discrimination also prohibits mistreatment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, Trump’s first administration interpreted sex discrimination as applying only to “the plain meaning of the word ‘sex’ as male or female and as determined by biology.”\n\nGroups that disagree with those various interpretations have sued, leading judges to place sex discrimination rules issued by Obama, Biden and the first Trump administration on hold.\n\nAnti-discrimination policies still exert powerful effects, said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute.\n\nThe Obama and Biden administrations’ policies helped institute “cultural norms requiring health providers to consider the needs of trans patients, even in places where state-level protections were not in existence yet,” Redfield said.\n\nTrump could also cause harm by rolling back legal protections for transgender patients, Redfield said, because health care providers might feel emboldened to deny them care.\n\n“If the federal government permits, or even condones, discrimination, it is likely that would galvanize those who already don’t want to treat trans people,” Redfield said.\n\nWithout a federal rule protecting their rights, transgender patients could lose the ability to file complaints against health care providers with the Department of Health and Human Services. They could still sue health care providers or insurance companies in court, but that process is “much more burdensome” than filing complaints with the federal health agency, Redfield said.\n\nA small number of transgender patients have successfully sued health care providers for discrimination based on the language in the ACA, said David Stacy, vice president of government affairs for the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights.\n\n“It is crucial that we continue to protect transgender patients, who already face immense obstacles when accessing care,” Stacy said. “Our leaders should be committed to ensuring that everyone can get the health care they need safely and without the fear of being mistreated.”\n\nSome states, such as California, have their own laws protecting transgender patients from discrimination, Redfield said.\n\nBut others are already following Trump’s example in restricting or trying to restrict the general rights of transgender people. In late February, Iowa struck gender identity from the state’s civil rights law, making it the first state to remove civil rights from a previously protected class.\n\nAbout 0.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender, according to the Pew Research Center. Transgender patients suffer from worse physical and mental health than other patients and are less likely to have health insurance.\n\nHouske said she can understand why some trans patients delay or avoid care.\n\n“It’s a lot of work emotionally” to see a doctor, Houske said. “If you’re doubting yourself at all, it’s really hard. It’s going to cause you not to seek the care you really need.”\n\nThreats to educational efforts at hospitals\n\nHouske said she sometimes tries to break the ice with new doctors by asking whether she is the first transgender person they have treated.\n\n“I just try to address the elephant in the room,” said Houske, who now lives in Ohio.\n\nDr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said health professionals should “deliver maximally compassionate care” to all patients, including those who are transgender.\n\n“It is absolutely foundational to emergency medicine that our door is open to anyone,” Haddock said. “We need to make sure that we are always delivering care that is consistent with that ethos.”\n\nSome medical schools and professional societies, such as the American College of Emergency Physicians, offer training in the health needs of LGBTQ patients, Haddock said.\n\n“I can attest to this being a much stronger part of the curriculum than when I was in medical school,” said Haddock, who is also a dean at Washington State University’s medical school.\n\nYet critics say medical schools aren’t adequately educating the next generation of doctors to care for LGBTQ patients. Many practicing doctors say they have had little training in transgender health issues and feel unprepared to treat trans patients.. Of all the state-level medical boards in the country, only the District of Columbia’s requires doctors to receive continuing education in treating LGBTQ patients, according to the Federation of State Medical Boards.\n\nAnd while the American Medical Association and the American Society for Health Care Risk Management offer educational courses about LGBTQ health and reducing bias, some health care leaders say other efforts could be throttled by Trump’s campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Many universities and private companies, for example, are ending DEI programs for fear of losing funding or contracts.\n\n“The political environment is making it really difficult” to include sexual orientation and gender identity in medical school courses, said Dr. Atul Grover, executive director of the Association of American Medical College’s Research and Action Institute.\n\n“We have lawmakers at the state and federal level who are convinced that incorporating the concepts of inclusion, health equity and diversity is taking away from the scientific content of what we’re teaching,” Grover said. “But it does not. These concepts aren’t mutually exclusive.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman whose sensational murder trial ended with a hung jury last year, is set to return to court this week as prosecutors again try to convict her in the 2022 killing of her boyfriend, a veteran Boston police officer.\n\nBut the lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was fired last month over allegations that he had disparaged Read and shared confidential investigative details, and legal experts say that Proctor will likely loom over the proceedings when they get underway Tuesday.\n\n“I suspect that Michael Proctor — and the state police investigation in general — will be the elephant in the courtroom throughout the trial,” said Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\n“At the time of his original testimony, he still had a job to rein him in,” said Stara Roemer, a former Dallas County prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in Texas. “Now that he no longer has that job, who knows what could come out of his mouth.”\n\n“This is a case that was already on the edge,” said criminal defense lawyer and NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos. “You’ve now deleted the lead investigator.”\n\nBoston Police Officer John O'Keefe. Boston Police Dept. via AP\n\nProctor led the investigation into the Jan. 29, 2022, death of John O’Keefe, who was found unresponsive in the yard of a then-Boston police sergeant in Canton, south of Boston. During the first trial, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally alleged that Read — furious over her deteriorating relationship with O'Keefe — drunkenly backed her Lexus SUV into him and left him for dead outside the sergeant’s home.\n\nRead was charged with second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death.\n\nKaren Read and John O'Keefe. via Dateline\n\nShe denies the allegations, and at her 2024 trial, her defense team alleged that she was the victim of an elaborate conspiracy that involved other law enforcement officers. Her lawyers alleged that O’Keefe was fatally beaten during an afterparty at the home of Brian Albert, and that he and others who were at the gathering framed Read for the killing. (Albert was not charged with any crimes, and he testified that O’Keefe never came inside his home.)\n\nThe defense accused Proctor of manipulating evidence and leading a biased investigation.\n\nThey pointed to text messages he sent to friends, relatives and supervisors in which he used offensive and vulgar language to describe Read. In one message to his sister, Proctor said he hoped Read died by suicide.\n\nThe defense also pointed to Proctor’s undisclosed ties to Albert and his family, and to investigative details Proctor shared with his sister, who was close friends with Albert’s sister-in-law.\n\nIn testimony, Proctor acknowledged that his comments were unprofessional and “dehumanized” Read. He admitted to discussing the case with his sister, but said he made her aware only of “newsworthy stuff.”\n\nProctor testified that his conduct did not compromise the integrity of the investigation.\n\nAfter a jury failed to reach a verdict and a judge declared a mistrial, the Massachusetts State Police suspended Proctor without pay and launched an internal affairs investigation into allegations raised at trial that the agency described as “serious misconduct.”\n\nProctor was dishonorably discharged in March after a state police trial board found that he had violated agency rules when he sent derogatory messages and shared sensitive and confidential details with non-law enforcement personnel.\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor testified in Norfolk Super Court, in Dedham, Mass., in 2024. Kayla Bartkowski / The Boston Globe via AP, Pool file\n\nThe board also found that Proctor drank alcohol while on duty and drove his cruiser afterward.\n\nProctor has not publicly commented on his termination, but his family said they were “truly disappointed” with the board’s decision, which they said “unfairly exploits and scapegoats one of their own, a trooper with a 12-year unblemished record.”\n\nIt’s unclear what role Proctor will play in the second trial. He’s included on a possible witness list that Read’s attorneys filed earlier this year, and he will likely be used to bolster the same defense the lawyers made last year, said Medwed, of Northeastern.\n\n“The defense, as in the first trial, will likely emphasize the shoddiness of the investigation to try to create reasonable doubt, and Proctor’s dismissal will help that effort,” he said.\n\nHank Brennan, the special prosecutor appointed to retry the case, may not need the former trooper’s testimony about the investigation, said Romer, the former prosecutor. Brennan can likely establish those facts through other investigators, she said.\n\nBrennan could argue that Proctor’s termination could confuse or mislead the jury and should be excluded from trial, Romer said. In her view, the wiser approach would be to address the issues surrounding Proctor head-on.\n\n“The smart move for someone like Brennan in this situation is to get it all out on direct because it is much more powerful in front of a jury in terms of questioning that person’s credibility,” said Romer, referring to the prosecution’s direct examination. “If it comes out on cross-examination, it’ll seem like the state was hiding something.”\n\nBut Cevallos, the legal analyst, said that calling Proctor could be tricky for the prosecution.\n\n“He’s lost everything,” Cevallos said. “Think he’ll be willing to help?”\n\nIf subpoenaed, Cevallos said, Proctor may come across as a reluctant witness — someone who doesn’t refuse to testify but provides the kinds of answers that defense attorneys often hear when questioning law enforcement officers.\n\n“With the government, they’re very helpful,” he said. “When I do it, they lapse into, ‘yes, no, yes, no.’ That’s the way the game is played.”\n\nTo Romer, the trajectory of Read’s case is highly unusual. To have the lead investigator in a criminal case fired between trials just doesn’t happen, she said. But, the most unusual thing is that the public knows anything at all about Proctor’s “unprofessional” comments, she said.\n\n“Stuff like this happens all the time,” she said. “If you’ve ever had a conversation with a police officer, they talk about their cases and reveal information that they shouldn’t. It’s just, normally people don’t see it.”",

Overall, the percentage of auto parts that are sourced abroad hovers around 40%, said Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm.\n\n“U.S.-made cars with all U.S. parts is a fictional tale,” Ives said.\n\nIvan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, put it no less bluntly, telling NBC News this month, “There’s no vehicle where every single component is manufactured from the ground up in the United States.”\n\nA senior automotive executive, who asked to speak anonymously to avoid disrupting sensitive negotiations with the Trump administration, expressed concerns about the industry’s ability to adapt to tariffs because of manufacturers’ extensive supply chains abroad. Even though many vehicles — both American and foreign — are assembled domestically, they’re built using lots of parts that aren’t made in U.S. factories.\n\nConsumers could see price hikes of $4,000 to $12,500 per car because of tariffs, depending on the vehicle, according to a recent estimate by Anderson Economic Group, a consultancy that has worked for major automakers.\n\nA White House spokesperson pointed to the president’s previous statements that the best way for automakers to avoid tariffs is to build in America. The administration is also calling for tax breaks to incentivize purchases of U.S.-made vehicles and pursuing deregulation to lower industrywide costs, the spokesperson said.\n\nAutomakers are required by law to report the makeup of their car models to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which publishes a list each year. The report, mandated by the American Automobile Labeling Act, includes the percentage of parts that are sourced outside the United States and Canada, as well as the country of final assembly and the source of the vehicle’s motor and transmission. Drury said the list can be a handy guide for shoppers looking to see how exposed to tariffs a given model might be.\n\nThe 2025 Kia EV6, for example, is made of 80% U.S. and Canadian parts, according to the NHTSA’s list, making the South Korean vehicle one of the most North American-made of any global automaker. Most other models have far lower percentages of U.S. and Canadian parts, though the law doesn’t require automakers to differentiate between components sourced in the United States and those from Canada — potentially limiting the list’s utility to shoppers, given Canada might face blanket tariffs of up to 25% on most goods as soon as Wednesday.\n\nEven Tesla, which is run by multibillionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and assembles its vehicles in the United States, sources 20% to 25% of its parts from Mexico, according to the NHTSA list. Over 175 models from foreign automakers like Toyota, Volvo and BMW — many of which also build some vehicles in the United States — are made entirely abroad.\n\nAutomotive supply chains are robust, but they can also be fragile when there are shocks to the system, said Amy Broglin-Peterson, a supply chain expert at the Broad College of Business at Michigan State University. For decades, U.S. companies have offshored parts of their manufacturing operations, relying on factories in China, Mexico and other countries where labor is cheaper.\n\nAny tariffs on those foreign-made parts could add up, she said, especially within North America, where manufacturing is relatively integrated and items cross borders multiple times.\n\n“I actually see the parts tariffs to be more of a risk factor than a finished vehicle tariff,” Broglin-Peterson said.\n\nMoving more of automakers’ supply chains to the United States is possible, she said, and it could achieve the Trump administration’s national security goals while bolstering domestic manufacturing in the long run. But that could take years.\n\n“Establishing a presence here, from a manufacturing perspective, is not a short order,” she said. “It comes with a very lengthy timeline. It comes with a heavy cost.”",

The couple both work full-time, the filing says. This incident was first reported by The Atlantic.\n\nGarcia’s deportation comes as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to deport hundreds of people to El Salvador, many of them from Venezuela and almost all bound for the maximum security \"Terrorist Confinement Center,\" known by its Spanish acronym CECOT.\n\nMen arrive at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in an image released on March 31. El Salvador's Presidency press office via AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe deportation appears to coincide with the March 15 departure of three planeloads of people to El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those who were deported said they were falsely accused of gang affiliations because of their tattoos.\n\nGarcia, his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their legal team filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland last week calling for Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to ensure his return to the U.S. and for the government to stop paying El Salvador to keep him in prison.\n\nIn its filing on Monday, the government said that the U.S. courts don't have jurisdiction to seek his release.\n\nSalvadorean government images show crowds of men with shaven heads being marched by masked guards inside the largest jail in Latin America.\n\nTo her shock, Garcia's wife only learned her husband was being detained after spotting him in an image in a news article with his head shaved and wearing white overalls, the lawsuit says. The men were kneeling, their faces obscured — but she said she spotted his tattoos and two scars on his head.\n\nThe government, however, alleges that Garcia was an \"active member of the criminal gang MS-13,\" citing an unidentified informant at a 2019 bond hearing.\n\nGarcia's lawyers strenuously deny this and claim the government \"has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded allegation.\" Garcia left El Salvador to escape gang violence, his lawyers say, after gangsters threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents.\n\nThey do not deny that they had no legal authority to send him there.”\n\nVice President JD Vance weighed into the case and falsely said on X Tuesday that Garcia was a \"convicted MS-13 gang member.\" Garcia has no criminal convictions in the U.S. or in El Salvador, his legal team said in the lawsuit.\n\nIn a follow-up post on X Tuesday, Vance stood by his comments and called Garcia \"an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country,\" despite the 2019 protection order against his removal from the U.S.\n\n\"We disagree that he is an MS-13 gang member. The only basis of his gang membership was a confidential informant, there was never any hard and fast proof,\" Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said in a statement to NBC News in response to Vance’s posts on X.\n\n\"There is a judicial process. They could have gone back to the judge who in 2019 gave him an order of protection and could have asked that judge to lift that order. They didn’t do that, they just put him on an airplane,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg added.\n\nOn March 12, after finishing his shift as a sheet metal worker and picking up his child, Garcia was pulled over and arrested by Homeland Security agents, with one of them telling him his \"status has changed,\" a lawsuit calling for his release from last week shows.\n\nICE officers allegedly told him that his wife had to collect the couple's child within 10 minutes or he would be handed over to Child Protective Services, the filing says.\n\nShe arrived and found Garcia \"confused, distraught and crying,\" but she received no explanation for his arrest, the filing says.\n\nGarcia was interviewed and repeatedly asked about gang affiliations but told his wife that he was due to appear before an immigration judge and expected to be released. He then called her from a detention center in Texas, telling her he was about to be deported, the filing says.\n\nGarcia's lawsuit accuses the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and several cabinet members named as defendants of deciding to deport him without following the law, in full knowledge that \"El Salvador tortures individuals detained in CECOT.\"\n\n\"Upon information and belief, they did so knowing and intending that the Government of El Salvador would detain Plaintiff Abrego Garcia in CECOT immediately upon arrival,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe government's Monday court filing said that Garcia's legal team \"have not clearly shown a likelihood that Abrego Garcia will be tortured or killed in CECOT.\"\n\nThe human rights organization Cristosal last year reported that at least 261 people have died in Salvadoran prisons since 2022, while groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented extreme crowding and torture at Salvadorean prisons, including CECOT.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nThe case is due to be heard by a judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Friday.",

        "content": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon for a meet-and-greet session with House Republicans, according to Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., the chair of the House GOP conference, as President Donald Trump seeks to implement new tariffs and quickly pass his policy agenda.\n\nBessent’s timely visit, first reported by NBC News, is the latest in a string of meetings between House Republicans and key Trump administration officials called the “Meet the Cabinet” series, which McClain recently started orchestrating on Capitol Hill. In her leadership position, McClain is in charge of the House GOP’s messaging arm, as well as member services.\n\nThe goal of the meetings, McClain said, is to provide rank-and-file members with a direct line of communication with the new administration, which she argued will help educate House Republicans and make their messaging more effective. Some congressional Republicans have privately complained that they are often out of the loop on the White House’s moves, from the scope of upcoming tariffs to the Elon Musk-led cost-cutting crusade inside the federal government.\n\nHouse Republican conference chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich., is organizing meet-and-greets for GOP lawmakers with Trump administration officials. Tom Williams / Getty Images\n\n“We want to hear it from the horse’s mouth. ... We have to arm people with the facts,” McClain, who just stepped into the No. 4 leadership position this year, said in an interview. “Our members are able to ask tough questions to the person directly involved. It just brings everyone closer. It helps unify the conference.”\n\nSince McClain started the series in March, she has hosted several other members of the Trump administration on Capitol Hill. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with House Republicans in early March to kick off the series. And Vice President JD Vance joined a House Republican conference meeting last month ahead of a critical vote on government funding, which Vance strongly advocated for. Nearly every House Republican ended up voting for the bill, a big feat for GOP leadership and the White House.\n\nMcClain also helped organize a meeting in March between Musk and the entire Republican conference. While Musk is not part of Trump’s Cabinet, he has been a key player in the White House, and McClain said many rank-and-file Republicans had been clamoring to meet with him.\n\nLawmakers are likely to have plenty of questions Tuesday for Bessent, who will be dropping in on Capitol Hill at a critical moment. Trump is preparing to announce a new wave of tariffs Wednesday, which has created uncertainty for the markets and caused heartburn for some lawmakers, particularly in agriculture-heavy states.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans and the White House are racing to pass a massive tax, energy and border security package to enact Trump's agenda. Bessent is also huddling separately with top GOP leaders and key committee chairs Tuesday.\n\n“I think you’re going to get some really tough questions,” McClain said of Tuesday’s meeting with Bessent. “People will ask about the impacts of tariffs, interest rates, reconciliation. You’re going to get everything. There’s going to be a lot of questions, and there will probably be a lot of opinions.”\n\nThe House and the Senate are aiming to pass a compromise budget blueprint, which is needed to unlock the so-called reconciliation process that would allow Republicans to cut out Democrats. The House and the Senate each passed their own versions, though the Senate has come around to passing a budget resolution that more closely mirrors the House version.\n\nBut the Senate is still looking to make some changes, which the House would then need to swallow. The Senate could vote on its new blueprint as soon as this week.\n\nAfter Bessent, next on McClain’s wish list for the meet-and-greet series is Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, since immigration is another hot topic for the administration. No date is set, but a meeting is in the works, McClain said.\n\n“When I call a Cabinet member and ask them to do it, I have not had anyone tell me no,” McClain said. “And I know they’re busy. I know they’re trying to hit the ground running, but that just makes us all on the same sheet of music, singing from the same hymnal.”",

        "content": "The first major elections of President Donald Trump’s second term will take place Tuesday as voters head to the polls in Wisconsin, a perennial battleground, and in Trump-friendly territory in Florida.\n\nTens of millions of dollars have poured into Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday’s state Supreme Court race in a contest that could have huge national implications. It’s the first major statewide contest in a battleground since the 2024 election — and it’s happening in the state where Trump had his narrowest margin of victory in November.\n\nBillionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk has emerged as a major player in the Wisconsin race as he expands his political portfolio, providing Democrats with an early test of whether he can be an effective boogeyman.\n\nAnd in Florida, voters will head to the polls for special elections in the deep-red 1st and 6th Congressional Districts, where Republicans are looking to pad their razor-thin House majority. And though both districts are on Trump’s turf, Republicans have been anxious that the races could prove to be competitive, as grassroots energy — and dollars — boost the Democratic contenders.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET in Florida’s 6th District and 8 p.m. ET in the 1st District, which is in the Central time zone. And polls in Wisconsin close at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nA nonpartisan race in name only — with huge national and state ramifications\n\nTuesday’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks the second time in two years that the bench’s ideological majority will have been at stake. Liberals on the technically nonpartisan court hold a 4-3 advantage, and another liberal win could keep the majority alive for at least one more year — while a conservative victory would give conservatives the edge ahead of a term likely to bring cases about abortion rights, unions and collective bargaining rights, and congressional maps and redistricting.\n\nThe race is between liberal candidate Susan Crawford — a state circuit judge in Madison who has received the backing of the state and national Democratic Party organizations, as well as the financial support, directly and indirectly, of a cadre of liberal billionaires — and Brad Schimel, a state circuit judge and former Republican state attorney general who has the backing of Trump and Musk, the leader of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nHowever, more than Trump, who endorsed Schimel 11 days ahead of the race in a late-night social media post, it has been Musk who has taken on the starring role in the campaign on both sides.\n\n“It’s become kind of a referendum on the Trump administration and what Elon Musk is doing as part of that, and Musk has amplified that by getting involved in Wisconsin,” said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “If there was any doubt about whether this election had a connection to national politics, Trump and Musk have made that connection for voters.”\n\nMusk and his super PAC have spent at least $15 million to boost Schimel, campaign finance records show, on top of three $1 million prizes Musk has awarded to people who signed his petition against “activist judges.” He went to Wisconsin on Sunday night to campaign for Schimel in person.\n\nDemocrats and groups supporting Crawford leaned heavily into making Musk the centerpiece of the race, attacking him in ads, on the trail and on social media over his actions at DOGE and accusing him of “trying to buy” Schimel. (Many groups also pointed out that Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, filed a suit in Wisconsin in January challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships — a case that could go before the state Supreme Court.)\n\nOverall, Democrats and their affiliated outside groups have outspent Republicans on the airwaves — they’ve spent almost $42 million, compared with almost $33 million from conservatives, enough to make it the most expensive state Supreme Court race on record in terms of ad spending, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nDespite the level of attention and spending, the springtime, off-year contest will feature far fewer voters than in presidential and midterm races — meaning both sides have sought to juice their turnout Tuesday.\n\nSchimel and Republican and conservative groups supporting him have heavily emphasized Trump’s endorsement — a move that could help turn out Republican voters in a state that Trump carried in two of the past three presidential elections.\n\nIn addition to running ads touting the endorsement down the home stretch of the campaign, Schimel appeared at a campaign town hall event in March with Donald Trump Jr. and told a group of canvassers from the conservative group Turning Point USA that Trump needs a “support network” around him to help him fight the myriad suits his administration has faced.\n\nWhile the race also included a barrage of messaging on both sides about crime and reproductive rights, groups supporting Schimel, in addition to focusing on Trump, built a closing message on the airwaves that attacked Crawford over transgender issues — a move that replicates the successful strategy Republicans and Trump used during the final weeks of their winning 2024 campaign.\n\nSpecial election tests on Trump’s turf\n\nThe pair of Florida special elections will be fought on Trump’s territory, testing his influence over his base and Democrats’ enthusiasm in the Trump era. Republicans expect to win both races, but there are concerns that closer-than-expected results could fuel a narrative of Democratic momentum.\n\nThe winner in Florida’s 1st District, in the Panhandle, will replace GOP former Rep. Matt Gaetz, while the 6th District winner will replace GOP former Rep. Michael Waltz, now Trump’s national security adviser. Trump carried the 1st District by 37 points in November and the 6th by 30 points, according to election results from NBC News’ Decision Desk.\n\nThe races are more competitive because of expectations of lower turnout, which Democrats have leveraged in other special elections in the Trump era, and blockbuster fundraising from the two Democratic candidates.\n\nRepublicans have raised more concerns about the race in the 6th District, where GOP state Sen. Randy Fine is competing against Democratic teacher Josh Weil, pointing to Fine’s lackluster fundraising and late ad spending. In the 1st District, state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis faces Democrat Gay Valimont, a former activist with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America who ran against Gaetz in November.\n\nBoth Republican candidates have Trump’s backing, and he held tele-town halls for them last week, encouraging his voters to go to the polls. They’ve also gotten boosts from outside groups in recent days. Musk’s super PAC has also jumped into the contests, spending nearly $100,000 on phone calls and texts in the races, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe Democratic candidates haven’t directly targeted Musk in their ads. But both suggested in recent interviews that the Musk-led effort to slash the size of the federal government and potential GOP cuts to entitlement programs could affect their races, since the 1st District has a large share of veterans and the 6th District has a sizable senior population.\n\nNational flavor in Wisconsin down-ballot items, too\n\nFurther down the Wisconsin ballot Tuesday are two other races that haven’t gotten much national attention but have been major local issues. There is a proposed amendment to enshrine an existing voter ID law into the state constitution, as well as a state school superintendent’s race that has become something of a referendum on the role Musk has played in downsizing the federal government.\n\nThe voter ID law is already part of the state code, but conservatives want to add it to the constitution to make it more difficult to strike the law down — if, for example, a liberal-majority state Supreme Court were to invalidate it with a ruling. Trump endorsed the proposed amendment on social media Monday.\n\nBut many strategists in the state, including Republicans, have acknowledged another motivation for adding the question to the ballot was to juice conservative turnout in the Supreme Court race.\n\nThe race for superintendent of public instruction — a job that oversees the state’s education system — has taken on increased importance in the weeks since Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Education Department, thereby beginning a process to put far more responsibility for education policy directly in states’ hands.\n\nLike the state Supreme Court contest, the technically nonpartisan race has taken on a distinctly partisan flavor. The incumbent, Jill Underly, is backed by the state Democratic Party, while her challenger, Brittany Kinser, has the backing of conservative groups and funders, though she has called herself a moderate.\n\nKinser is an education consultant who has made expanding school choice programs the main tenet of her campaign.\n\nUnderly, who is in her first term, has tried to tie Kinser to Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Education Department, as well as Musk’s DOGE effort.",

And we respond by saying, ‘Well, right now we don’t know, so they postpone their order or cancel their order because they want to know before they order what the cost is going to be,” said Graeme Roustan, who owns the company that makes and sells more than 100,000 hockey sticks annually to the U.S. market.\n\nThe prospect of 25% tariffs by President Donald Trump on Canadian imports, currently paused for some goods but facing full implementation on Wednesday, has caused headaches if not havoc throughout the commercial ecosystem.

About 40% of Roustan’s business is with the U.S. market, and about 90% of sales of Christian and Northland gear go to American customers.\n\n“Our business with the U.S. is steady right now because people are trying to get their orders in before the tariffs take effect, but I’m very concerned that once the tariffs go into effect that there will be people in, say, Minnesota who will think twice about buying a Christian or a Northland stick because of the 25% tariff,” Roustan said in a phone interview. “So the unknown is still unknown.”\n\nMany pieces of retail hockey equipment originate in Asia, including China. Mexico is another player in the market, home to a factory for Warrior brand sticks, for example. Those countries are in the tariff crosshairs, too.\n\n“Whether it’s in effect for a week or gets retracted or whether it’s a future date where we’re going to have some announcement, all that makes it very challenging to run and operate a business,” said Todd Smith, the chief executive officer of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. “The general viewpoint is uneasiness and confusion.”\n\nRoustan bought Bauer’s hockey outfitting business from Nike in 2008 and oversaw that company for four years. By the time Roustan assumed control, he said, Bauer — born in Canada in 1927 and a ubiquitous name in the sport — had shifted all of its manufacturing sites to Asia for cost savings on labor and facilities.\n\n“The industry has done an admirable job of manufacturing across the globe while doing as much as they possibly can domestically,” Smith said. “The components made internationally are made internationally because we don’t have the manufacturing capability in the U.S. and we don’t have the workforce.”\n\nIn hockey, of course, a lot of gear is required to take the ice. That gear is also notoriously expensive, which puts this sport as subject to the tariff tumult as any. Just in North America, hockey equipment is a $1.3 billion business and growing, as estimated by Grand View market research. Any added cost from the import tax will almost certainly trickle down to the consumer.\n\nOrganizations like SFIA have long had an eye on rising costs of youth sports, concerned about the effect on participation and driven to increase accessibility to all activities in underprivileged communities.\n\n“If folks aren’t aware of it now, they should be well aware that tariffs are bad for sports across the board,” Smith said.\n\nThe shows will still go on, tariffs or not\n\nMost families with kids in sports are busy enough shuttling those young athletes to practices and shopping for the next round of gear that topics like international politics, global economics and commercial supply chains usually get the backseat.\n\nTariffs might drive up the price of hockey sticks? Well, just add that to the pile.\n\nFor Jeremiah Lamont and his family in Minneapolis, staying on top of the equipment inventory for two hockey-playing boys is enough of project on its own. Paying for it is another story, as his 12-year-old son Max enters each new stage of competition.\n\n“The youth skates cost about $200. Well, his foot grows a half-inch, he can’t get into the youth ones, and now those same skates are $450,” Lamont said, estimating the current total cost of gear at more than $1,500, some of which must be annually replaced.\n\nIce time and travel costs sold separately, of course.\n\n“He likes it. It’s good for him. So we just figure, ‘Why not?’” Lamont said.\n\nThe sticker shock is real for hockey newbies, as Kelley Baer and her family in Colorado found out when now-13-year-old Brian got going on the ice. Sticks, skates, helmets, shin guards, elbow and shoulder pads, chest protectors, neck guards, they all add up.\n\nThose sticks don’t always last the season, either, that vital-yet-fragile piece of equipment perpetually at risk for fracturing from an awkward hit — or in a moment of frustration. In the NHL, a replacement is always at the ready. A pile of sticks is a luxury many young players don’t have.\n\n“I’m like, “No, no, no, no, no! That is a $400 stick. Do not slam that thing on the ice!” Baer said. “We always laugh about that, but it’s also very serious. We used it as a gateway of a conversation about showing your emotions on the ice and how you’ve got to be able to contain that as a leader. If you start losing your mind and slamming your stick, that’s a disadvantage for you.”\n\nThe life lessons in sports run as deep as the passions that fuel this giant slice of economy and culture.\n\n“Yes, it’s expensive and we are fortunate in that we can afford it,” Baer said. “He’s our kid, and we love him. We want to support him in what he wants to do, and we’ll figure out a way.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — As morning alarms roused people on the East Coast for their work days, Sen. Cory Booker still hadn't returned home from his the night before. Instead, he was delivering an overnight speech on the Senate floor — and was still going Tuesday morning after 14 hours.\n\nBooker showed no signs of slowing down after 9 a.m., speaking with animated gestures as he slammed the Trump administration.\n\n\"Twelve hours now I'm standing, and I'm still going strong because this president is wrong, and he's violating principles that we hold dear and principles in this document that are so clear and plain,\" Booker said at around 7 a.m., holding up a copy of the Constitution.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat took the floor at 7 p.m. Monday, announcing that he intended to disrupt \"the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able.\"\n\n“I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis,” Booker said.\n\nIn the hours that followed, he painted his speech as a warning over the \"grave and urgent\" threat Americans faced from the Trump administration, arguing that \"bedrock commitments\" to the country \"are being broken.\"\n\n\"Unnecessary hardships are being born by Americans of all backgrounds, and institutions which are special in America, which are precious, which are unique in our country, are being recklessly — and I would say even unconstitutionally — affected, attacked and even shattered,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokespersons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBooker has remained standing and has not left the floor for a bathroom break during his entire speech because he would lose control of the Senate floor if he leaves his desk or sits down. He has been joined by other Democratic senators who have chimed in to speak and ask questions while Booker retained control of the floor — giving his voice a rest.\n\nThe lawmakers have highlighted their own criticisms of the Trump administration, laying out the impact of Trump's first few months in office and asking Booker for his perspective.\n\nAs of early Tuesday morning, Booker's speech was not having an impact on floor consideration of any bills or nominations. But depending on how long he continues, the senator's remarks could affect Senate business. The chamber is expected to vote today on Matthew Whitaker’s nomination to be the U.S. ambassador to NATO, though that timing will likely depend on whether Booker's speech pushes past 10 a.m., when the Senate typically convenes.\n\nDuring his speech, Booker shared letters from constituents and read news articles. He spoke about Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died in 2020, calling him \"one of my greatest heroes of life.\"\n\n\"I start tonight thinking about him, I've been thinking about him a lot during these last 71 days. 'Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, help redeem the soul of America,'\" Booker said, invoking Lewis' words. \"And had to ask myself, if he's my hero, how am I living up to his words?\"\n\nBooker added that he was delivering the speech \"with the intention of getting in some 'good trouble.'\"\n\nLong speeches have put other senators on the national stage. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke for 21 hours and 18 minutes to oppose the Affordable Care Act in 2013. Three years earlier, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., delivered an eight-and-a-half hour speech that is often credited with raising his political profile.\n\nThe record for the longest Senate speech on record is held by Sen. Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina segregationist who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Thurmond was a Democrat at the time but changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1964.\n\nThis is Booker's first time leading a marathon speech, though he joined Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., for that senator's nearly 15-hour-filibuster to advocate for gun control in 2016.",

        "title": "Kristen Welker: Interview Tips for Journalists, From 'Meet the Press'",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Interviewing is a foundational skill in journalism. Even Kristen Welker, moderator of “Meet the Press,” knows it’s one of the most difficult to master.\n\n“The best advice I ever received on interviewing is that interviewing is not about talking, it’s not about asking — it’s about listening,” said Welker. “If you are armed with the facts, if you’re armed with a good set of questions and follow-up questions, then when you hear something really significant, you’re present and you’re in the moment and ready to follow up.”\n\nTo prepare for the Sunday morning news show every week, Welker does extensive research, notetaking and mock interviews to anticipate various directions that conversations might take.\n\n“When people come on ‘Meet the Press,’ they know that it’s going to be the most challenging interview that they could possibly have — and fair,” Welker said. “That is my goal with each interview.”\n\nTo see Welker’s interviewing approach, check out the video above and read some of her tips below.\n\nWhy do journalists do interviews?\n\nThere are a few key goals with every journalistic interview.\n\nFirst, to make sure that the person you’re interviewing gets to express their perspective and their opinion. I try to never interrupt the person I’m interviewing, even when I’m interviewing them over satellite. Sometimes it’s a little challenging, but you want to let everyone get out their perspective.\n\nThe next goal is to make sure that you are asking them challenging questions, holding them to account for their words, for their actions. Part of that requires going back in time, looking at their past statements, looking at their past interviews, to make sure that you’re holding them to account not just for what they said this week, but what they may have said several years ago.\n\nAnd then finally, it’s to educate the viewer. You want to make sure you are educating the public with every interview. You hope that the viewer, that your reader, that your listener comes away from every interview with new and important information.\n\nHow do you prepare for an interview?\n\nWhen I’m preparing for an interview, I absolutely try to commit as much to memory as possible. I also have written notes in front of me and I take notes throughout the course of the interview. I conduct mock interviews so that I can anticipate where the interview might be going, but sometimes it takes a turn that I’m not necessarily prepared for.\n\nBut if I’ve done enough mock interviews, if I’ve read enough, if I’ve researched enough, hopefully I’m nimble enough to ask a follow-up question, to elicit the type of information or answer that will be valuable to our viewers.\n\nAnchor Kristen Welker and producer Caitlin Hartman prepare before an interview, March 2025. (Benjamin Pu / NBC News)\n\nHow do you prepare for an interview that you know might be confrontational?\n\nThe way to make sure that you start off on the right foot with people is to go big picture at first, to let the person say what they want to say … to give them space to talk about their viewpoint on an issue that they really care about.\n\n[Former “Meet the Press” moderator] Tim Russert had a really wonderful stylistic approach of ending sometimes on a somewhat lighter note, and that enabled him to show a little bit of his personality to the audience, and for the person he’s interviewing to feel like they got to end on a slightly lighter note.\n\nPoliticians sometimes say journalists ask too many “gotcha” questions. What’s your opinion on “gotcha questions”?\n\nI try not to ever ask “gotcha questions,” and what I mean by that is, I try to ask questions that the person I’m interviewing can answer, is equipped to answer, has the expertise to answer. I try to make these open-ended questions. I try not to ask yes or no questions.\n\nBut I really try to give people the space and the breadth to give their perspective. I think if you’re viewing every question through that lens, you’re going to cut down on that notion of whatever someone might consider to be a “gotcha question.”\n\nWhat tips do you have for people who someday want to work for “Meet the Press”?\n\nIn order to get a job like “Meet the Press,” which is truly the greatest honor of my life, it took years and decades and, quite frankly, of a lot of hard work. And I enjoyed the journey. My advice to people who are starting their careers: Get that first job. Say yes, learn as much as you can. Raise your hand.\n\nMy first job on-air was in Redding, California, about five hours north of San Francisco. I did all my own camera work. I carried a tripod around. I carried a battery bag around. I operated the teleprompter with my foot. I even did the weather.\n\nAnd it was one of the best experiences of my life, because I learned so much about how broadcast news works. I have so much respect for everyone who works in every newsroom, because I lived a mini version of it.\n\nWelker’s headshot, 2001 (KRCR-TV)\n\nWelker as a multimedia journalist (KRCR-TV)\n\nWelker’s first show as an anchor, 2001 (KRCR-TV)\n\nWelker reporting on the 2008 presidential campaign (WCAU-TV)\n\nSpecial thanks to Kurtis Ming, Kerry Loring, Toby Lyles, Adam Kessler, Joe Gabriel, Tom Craca, Caitlin Hartman and Louise Rath.\n\n",

        "content": "Time is running out for José Alfredo Pacheco, a dialysis patient in Illinois who needs a lifesaving kidney transplant. His donor and brother, José Gregorio González, has been in an immigration detention center for nearly a month and is at risk of being deported to Venezuela.\n\nCommunity members in the Chicago area have been rallying in support of the brothers. They're gathering at a vigil Monday evening organized by The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit group representing the brothers, to demand González's release on humanitarian parole so he can donate a kidney to his sick brother.\n\nWith deportation flights to Venezuela resuming following a brief suspension on March 8, \"there's incredible urgency because José Gregorio could be deported at any time now,\" Tovia Siegel, director of organizing and leadership at The Resurrection Project's Immigrant Justice Department, told NBC News. The group is providing legal representation to González.\n\nGonzález, 43, arrived in the United States from Venezuela last year to reunite with his brother, who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, or kidney failure, in December 2023. Since then, González had been caring for his younger brother. They share the same mother.\n\nPacheco, 37, goes to a center three times a week at 4 a.m. for four-hour dialysis sessions. On March 3, he was returning home from his dialysis session and González greeted him with breakfast, Siegel said. After having eaten, González stepped outside his home and was approached by several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who arrested him and took him to the Clay County Detention Center in Indiana, where he is being held.\n\nJosé Gregorio González and his brother, José Alfredo Pacheco. Courtesy The Resurrection Project\n\nGonzález sought asylum in the United States. But after he did not pass an initial credible fear interview, immigration authorities placed a deportation order on him. He was still allowed to remain in the United States under ICE supervision, which is not uncommon.\n\nSiegel said ICE was aware of González’s location because he had been wearing a GPS ankle monitor as part of his order of supervision. ICE uses such orders to place immigrants in one of its supervision programs, allowing it to monitor and keep tabs on undocumented people. The programs, which are meant to serve as alternatives to detention, help immigration officials keep track of those who are not priorities for deportation or need more time to seek legal alternatives to remain in the United States. According to ICE, nearly 179,000 people are being monitored through such programs nationwide.\n\nSiegel said González has no criminal record and had been complying with the requirements of his order of supervision since he was first placed in the program last year when he entered the United States.\n\n“He was really here taking care of his brother and preparing to donate his kidney to his brother,” she said.\n\nICE and DHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWithout González’s kidney donation, Pacheco will most likely need to wait years to receive a transplant, according to a letter from Pacheco’s doctors obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"The waiting time on the cadaver kidney transplant waiting list for Mr. Pacheco is about 4 to 5 years in his blood group. Unfortunately, the mortality on dialysis while waiting for kidney transplantation is extremely high,\" the letter reads. \"Living donor kidney transplantation ensures the highest chance of survival.\"\n\nGonzález is the living kidney donor Pacheco desperately needs, because, according to the letter, even in the case of blood group incompatibility with his brother, González could secure a transplant for Pacheco by participating in a paired kidney exchange, which connects pairs of compatible recipients and donors.\n\nJosé Gregorio González and José Alfredo Pacheco. Courtesy The Resurrection Project\n\nParticipating in a paired kidney exchange means González could save two lives, his brother's and a second kidney recipient's, Siegel said. \"So there are multiple lives, multiple families being harmed, being separated and being denied the lifesaving medical care they need if José Gregorio is deported.\n\n\"I think it speaks to José Gregorio's character,\" Siegel added. “It’s under ICE’s discretion whether or not to release him, even temporarily, for him to be able to save Alfredo’s life.”\n\nGonzález told Telemundo Chicago in Spanish last week in a phone call from inside the detention center: “I hope I can go out and achieve that goal of giving my kidney to my brother. I hope he has a lot of faith and patience that we will soon be together and do the transplant.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Pacheco told Telemundo Chicago he feels like \"the world fell on me\" since ICE detained his brother. \"Give my brother a chance and me a chance to continue living.”",

        "content": "NICOSIA, Cyprus — A criminal court in Cyprus has dropped all charges against five Israelis accused of gang-raping a British woman in a hotel room after ruling her testimony as not credible and replete with “fundamental contradictions.”\n\nAccording to a Cyprus News Agency report issued late Monday that cited a criminal court announcement, the court found during closed-door proceedings that most of the contradictions in the woman’s testimony concerned the identification of the perpetrators.\n\nThe court said the woman’s initial statement to investigators following the Sept. 3, 2023, alleged rape presented a number of “weaknesses,” which under the circumstances weren’t “out of the ordinary.”\n\nBut investigators’ doubts regarding the woman’s credibility grew when she offered “entirely incomprehensible and inconsistent” explanations regarding the contradictions in her testimony, specifically regarding the identification of the perpetrators which also included a line-up.\n\nThe court said the woman — who was 20 at the time of the alleged rape — was under the influence of a “significant” amount of alcohol and the hallucinogens MDA and MDMA, popularly known as “Sally” and “Molly.”\n\nBut it found the quantities in her system weren’t enough to “remove her ability for consent” since she testified that she only felt “a little dizzy” after consuming the alcohol and drugs.\n\nAll five of the Israeli men — then ages 19 and 20 — had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nPolice had said the British woman picked the five Israelis out of a line-up as having raped her during a hotel pool party in the coastal resort town of Ayia Napa.\n\nThe woman told police that one of the five men had forcibly taken her to his room after grabbing her hand while she was partying with friends around the pool.\n\nShe said the man tried to remove her bathing suit while she pleaded with him to let her leave. The other suspects then entered the room and one had intercourse with her against her will and another forced her to perform oral sex, while two others held her down on the bed, she said.\n\nShe said one suspect also held her against a wall and had intercourse with her.\n\nShe said she managed to lock herself in the bathroom and began shouting for help. She was able to flee the room by pushing the suspects aside and rejoined her friends, who went with her to report the incident to the police, she said.\n\nThe ruling came after the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month that Cyprus’ law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager’s allegations that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in Ayia Napa.",

It accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students and promoting “divisive ideologies over free inquiry.”\n\nHarvard had been bracing for the development. In recent months, it had moved cautiously, seeking compromise and, critics said, cracking down on speech. The approach riled some who worried that Harvard was capitulating at a moment of creeping authoritarianism.\n\nThough it remains unclear how much the university will actually lose, if anything, the move on Monday shows that the conciliatory approach hasn’t fended off its critics yet.",

        "content": "General Caine’s writings and interviews with people who know him paint a portrait of a thoughtful officer with a reputation for integrity, a contrast with some other high-ranking administration officials who often appear to place their fealty to the president above all else.\n\nLt. Gen. Dan Caine’s pocket-size copy of the Constitution is tattered and bound with green military tape.\n\nHe carries it with him routinely, including slipping it in his flight suit when he flew fighter jets in the Air Force. He had it on him on Sept. 11, 2001, when he was the lead aviator assigned to protect Washington after hijackers slammed commercial jets into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.\n\nGeneral Caine’s loyalty to the Constitution and his reputation for adhering to ethical standards are major reasons the Senate Armed Services Committee is likely to give him a largely friendly reception on Tuesday as the members consider his nomination to become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation’s highest-ranking military position.\n\nGeneral Caine’s writings, coupled with interviews with some who know him, paint a portrait of a modest, thoughtful and personable officer with a reputation for integrity. That sets him apart from some other high-ranking administration officials who often appear to place their fealty to the president above all else.\n\n“He has strong moral fiber,” said Raj Shah, who led a high-level Defense Department unit on innovation and has known General Caine for 20 years. He added, “He is one of the most humble, principled and strategic leaders I have known.”\n\nBut General Caine will still have to navigate some tough questions about whether he will give his best unvarnished military advice to President Trump or tell him what he wants to hear.\n\n“We have to determine whether he has the professional skills to do the job,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the panel’s senior Democrat, said in a phone interview. “But we also need to know whether he will stand up to the president and say if something is not lawful.”\n\nThe hearing will be an exercise in needle-threading for the 34-year military veteran with a polished record, possibly the first of many as he tries to maintain credibility with Mr. Trump while staying true to military and ethical norms. It comes amid broad outrage over the administration’s careless handling of highly sensitive military plans for last month’s attacks in Yemen. Many outside experts have said the administration’s top national security officials ignored rules on handling such information in ways that could have risked the safety of the American pilots involved.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared the timing and targets of imminent military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi militants over the commercial messaging app Signal, has said he did not relay classified information. Mr. Trump has dismissed the controversy as a minor fumble.\n\nDemocrats on the committee are expected to ask General Caine whether he considers the information that was shared to be classified and whether he would have advised the use of secure government channels instead of a Signal chat that inadvertently included a journalist.\n\nImage General Caine is expected to be asked on Tuesday about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s sharing the timing and targets of imminent military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi militants over the commercial messaging app Signal. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nNonetheless, they are unlikely to press him to directly criticize the administration’s actions for fear of irreparably harming his relationships with the president and Mr. Hegseth even before he takes office. They see the general as a potential guardrail against possibly rash or even illegal military actions by the Trump administration, and so want to preserve his influence.\n\nGeneral Caine, 56, who is stepping out of military retirement, faces a steep learning curve. By statute, anyone picked to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is supposed to have served as a combatant commander, as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or as the top uniformed officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps or Space Force — all four-star positions (General Caine retired with three). Mr. Trump has invoked a waiver to bypass that requirement.\n\nAn F-16 pilot with 150 combat flight hours, General Caine has a background in highly secretive intelligence and special operations assignments that stands out from those of previous nominees. In the three years before he retired from the military in December, he was an associate director for military affairs at the C.I.A.\n\nGeneral Caine has sprinkled self-insights and bits of advice in two blogs. Recurrent themes are his efforts to improve his communication skills, his pursuit of self-control and odes to fallen service members.\n\nOne of his favorite books, he wrote, is “The Daily Stoic,” a 405-page treatise about the virtues of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom. Another is “Strength for Service to God and Country,” a book of devotions for those in the military or public service. He also recommended “The Four-Hour Work Week” by Tim Ferriss, a book on strategies to achieve one’s goals with less effort.\n\nHis Air Force nickname, which the president is said to relish, is “Razin Caine.” But the lifestyle he described in a 2020 blog post seems a model of discipline. He laid out a six-day workweek and this daily schedule:\n\nWake up to a 4:15 a.m. alarm; spend 45 minutes over coffee in reflection and Bible study; work out for an hour; listen to a half-hour of Bloomberg News or a podcast over a protein shake; work for 11 to 12 hours; and then bed at 9 p.m.: “67 degrees, dark room.”\n\nHe so far has eschewed public discussion of politics. Perhaps the closest he has come was a 2018 blog post, written during Mr. Trump’s first term, about the potential impact of tariffs the president was proposing. He linked to a webcast by a corporate leader who called for free trade, describing the issue as “fascinating.”\n\nImage General Dan Caine meeting with an Iraqi general in 2018. Credit... SPC Keisha Brown/U.S. Army, via Associated Press\n\nMr. Trump and General Caine met only once before, in late 2018, when the president visited U.S. troops in western Iraq. But the meeting eventually took on political overtones. General Caine told the president that the Islamic State was not so tough and could be defeated in a week, not two years as senior advisers predicted, Mr. Trump recounted in 2019.\n\nAt a Conservative Political Action Conference meeting the next year, and subsequently since then, Mr. Trump has said that General Caine put on a Make America Great Again hat while meeting with him in Iraq. General Caine has told aides he has never put on a MAGA hat.\n\nHis business career is another contrast with previous nominees. From 2009 to 2016, as a part-time member of the National Guard, he founded or led a string of companies, drawing partners, employees and customers from his wide network of military contacts. Most were small aviation-related firms with fewer than 25 employees.\n\nThe federal government hired one of his firms, Global Risk Reduction, to help put safety protocols in place at a biocontainment laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland. General Caine helped train lab employees in how to prevent, track, investigate and correct safety lapses, said Dr. James Lawler, the laboratory’s former chief medical officer.\n\n“We all trusted Dan,” he said. “He is the kind of leader who comes into a room and the first thing he does, usually, is admit his own faults and mistakes, and then he listens to everybody else.”\n\nAnother company the general founded, called Patriot Technologies Group, provided air surveillance and support for U.S. armed forces training exercises. A pilot and two crew members employed by the company were killed when their plane crashed in a 2010 training session in Florida. General Caine, a lieutenant colonel at the time, was in another plane during the exercise.\n\nThe widows of the men who died sued the government, claiming that Air Force personnel on the ground had failed to warn the pilot of a thunderstorm that caused the plane crash. Daniel O. Rose, a lawyer who specializes in airline crash cases and who represented the widows, deposed General Caine as part of the case. He said he expected him to defend the Air Force personnel out of loyalty.\n\n“I just couldn’t believe it when he started talking,” Mr. Rose said. “He really was calling it straight, calling the Air Force out. He really is just a stand-up guy.”\n\nThe government ultimately settled the case.\n\nNone of General Caine’s business ventures made him particularly wealthy, judging by a review of his property holdings and interviews with his friends. But after he retired from the military at the end of last year, lucrative work seemed in the offing. He became a venture partner at two investment firms and an adviser to a third, led by Josh Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in law.\n\n“He had been offered other military jobs, and he turned them down. He had moved on to the private sector,” said Mr. Shah, the co-founder and managing partner of Shield Capital, which hired General Caine before Mr. Trump chose him as his top military adviser.\n\n“He was not looking for this job,” Mr. Shah said.\n\nJulie Tate contributed research.",

        "content": "Senator Cory Booker gave a marathon all-night speech on the Senate floor that stretched into Tuesday morning, in an effort to put a spotlight on what he called a “crisis” facing the United States because of the Trump administration’s “recklessness.”\n\nMr. Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, began speaking at 7 p.m. on Monday, according to news reports, and was still addressing the chamber, which was largely empty, as of 8 a.m. Eastern.\n\nThe speech appeared to be part of an attempt by Democrats to retake the initiative and more assertively oppose President Trump. The senator divided his remarks into sections focused on an aspect of the administration’s policies, including on health care, education, immigration and national security.\n\nHe assailed what he said were Mr. Trump’s plans to cut funding for Medicaid, among other programs. The White House has denied that it plans to cut Medicaid benefits, but the president and his allies have attacked Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security over what they claim is waste, fraud and abuse.",

Greg Abbott is slow-walking the special election to replace Sylvester Turner,” Mr. Jeffries said. “They are rigging the system.”\n\nRepublicans hold a slim 218-to-213 majority over Democrats, but two open House seats in Florida are likely to be filled by Republicans after a special election on Tuesday. Mr. Trump also pulled his nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik to the United Nations, fearing that a vacant seat in her New York district could be won by a Democrat.",

        "content": "The Penn investigation, which remains open, is one of several across the country in which universities have turned to more sophisticated technology and shows of police force to investigate student vandalism and other property crimes related to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. (The student who had his phone seized did not respond to an interview request.)\n\nThe warrants were first reported by The Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn’s independent student newspaper, which filed a lawsuit after police did not initially file the warrants with a local court.\n\nMuch of it happened even before President Trump returned to office. Since then, he has made clear he will use his power to force universities to take a hard line on protests. His administration has warned 60 universities that they could face penalties from investigations into antisemitism, and has also begun seeking to deport protesters. At least nine current or former students and one professor who were legally in the United States with visas or green cards have already been targeted, with at least one student being detained on the street by officials in plainclothes.\n\nAnd it pulled $400 million in funding from Columbia University, telling the school that it would not discuss restoring the money unless, among other things, campus security agents were given “full law enforcement authority” to arrest students. In response, the university said it had hired 36 “special officers” with that authority.\n\nCivil rights lawyers and legal experts said the moves were a fundamental shift in the way universities respond to student disciplinary cases. While arrests and searches are already often within the authority of many campus police agencies, recent tactics go beyond what has been the standard for campus security officers, said Farhang Heydari, an assistant professor of law at Vanderbilt University.",

Acute uncertainty about how the administration’s trade and immigration policies will unfold and affect the economy has made him much more cautious about any expansion plans.\n\nAs one of the country’s biggest producers of bedding plants, perennials and other flowers, Bergen’s Greenhouses is exposed on many fronts.\n\nEvery June, it trucks in more than six million pounds of peat moss from Manitoba. Suppliers have stopped quoting prices until they have more clarity on tariffs. The plastic flower pots that Mr. Bergen imports from China could also wind up costing more if tariffs remain in place, squeezing already “razor-thin margins,” he said. He is also worried about needing to find workers if Mr. Trump, as part of an immigration crackdown, ends a program that provides temporary visas to many of the company’s agricultural workers.\n\n“We’re not putting our foot on the brake, but we are taking our foot off the gas,” said Mr. Bergen, whose family has run the business for over a century.",

        "content": "The interim president of Columbia University abruptly left her post Friday evening as the school confronted the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding and the Trump administration’s mounting skepticism about its leadership.\n\nThe move came one week after Columbia bowed to a series of demands from the federal government, which had canceled approximately $400 million in essential federal funding, and it made way for Columbia’s third leader since August. Claire Shipman, who had been the co-chair of the university’s board of trustees, was named the acting president and replaced Dr. Katrina Armstrong.\n\nThe university, which was deeply shaken by a protest encampment last spring and a volley of accusations that it had become a safe haven for antisemitism, announced the leadership change in an email to the campus Friday night. The letter thanked Dr. Armstrong for her efforts during “a time of great uncertainty for the university” and said that Ms. Shipman has “a clear understanding of the serious challenges facing our community.”\n\nLess than a week ago, the Trump administration had signaled that it was satisfied with Dr. Armstrong and the steps she was taking to restore the funding. But in a statement on Friday, its Joint Task Force to Combat Antisemitism said that Dr. Armstrong’s departure from the presidency was “an important step toward advancing negotiations” between the government and the university.",

He added, “He is one of the most humble, principled and strategic leaders I have known.”\n\nBut General Caine will still have to navigate some tough questions about whether he will give his best unvarnished military advice to President Trump or tell him what he wants to hear.\n\n“We have to determine whether he has the professional skills to do the job,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the panel’s senior Democrat, said in a phone interview. “But we also need to know whether he will stand up to the president and say if something is not lawful.”\n\nThe hearing will be an exercise in needle-threading for the 34-year military veteran with a polished record, possibly the first of many as he tries to maintain credibility with Mr. Trump while staying true to military and ethical norms. It comes amid broad outrage over the administration’s careless handling of highly sensitive military plans for last month’s attacks in Yemen. Many outside experts have said the administration’s top national security officials ignored rules on handling such information in ways that could have risked the safety of the American pilots involved.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared the timing and targets of imminent military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi militants over the commercial messaging app Signal, has said he did not relay classified information. Mr. Trump has dismissed the controversy as a minor fumble.",

        "content": "The available data the scholars drew on did not identify who those people were or their specific circumstances, including whether any were lawful permanent residents, they said. They added: “It may well be that Mr. Khalil’s case is unprecedented in the history of this provision and in the history of the United States. At a minimum, the government’s assertion of authority here is extraordinary — indeed, vanishingly rare.”\n\nThere also appears to be only one case on record in which a federal district court judge has interpreted the 1952 law.\n\nIn 1996, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, President Trump’s sister, struck down the provision as unconstitutional. She said it was too vague for people to know what might render them deportable, and it gave too much unbounded power to the secretary of state. An appeals court later vacated her ruling for technical reasons, without analyzing the law’s constitutionality.\n\nThe case before Judge Barry involved a corrupt foreign official, not someone whose free-speech activities had made him a target, so her ruling did not turn on the restrictions Congress later added. But she scrutinized the modification anyway, and suggested that it may still be unconstitutionally vague despite a higher standard.\n\nGiven the unfolding wave of arrests, many other rulings assessing the law may soon join Judge Barry’s opinion. Immigration law experts, aware of the implications, warned that the power the Trump administration was claiming could go far beyond its foreign policy about Israel.\n\n“The presence of Ukrainians who are critical of Russia, supporters of more security cooperation with Europe, and economists skeptical of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, could all suddenly be considered adverse to U.S. foreign policy interests and subject to deportation based on the unilateral determination of the secretary of state,” they wrote. “This list has no end, and no meaningful limiting principles.”",

        "content": "The game, which took place at the Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan think tank focused on security issues, included think tank experts and former officials in the Trump and Biden administrations. The exercise was not aimed at predicting the future. Instead, by acting out what might happen, the participants were trying to reveal some of the dynamics that might be at play as Mr. Trump pursues an aggressive trade approach against allies and adversaries alike.\n\nIn the last two months, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as levies on global steel and aluminum imports. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump is expected to announce a plan to raise tariff rates on other countries, and his 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts will go into effect on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs have already prompted China and Canada to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, and other governments, including in Europe, are drawing up lists of American products to hit if Mr. Trump goes ahead with stiff levies.\n\nThe moves have increased U.S. tariffs to levels not seen since World War II and raised big questions about the future of global trade, including whether deals can be reached to forestall tariffs, and how tit-for-tat trade wars could unfold.\n\nThe game at the Center for a New American Security was an effort to explore how all these dynamics might play out. A game board situated on the conference table of the think tank’s board room showed the stakes. Little wooden cubes — green for good, yellow for bad, and red for terrible — were scattered around the board to keep track of how the simulated trade tensions were affecting public opinion, domestic security, international tensions, the economy and other factors in various parts of the world.",

Mr. Giuliani was found in that case to have defamed the women as he tried to help Mr. Trump overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, and was ordered to pay the women $148 million.\n\nMr. Trump has issued executive orders targeting other law firms that employ people he sees as hostile to him, and it was unclear how Willkie planned to respond to such an action.\n\nTwo other firms hit with executive orders have agreed to deals with Mr. Trump in exchange for him rescinding or heading off the orders, drawing criticism from those who see them as capitulating to strong-arm tactics by the president.

        "content": "It can feel as if the Democratic Party has a lot of work to do before it is ready to win elections again. Its agenda appears exhausted. Its voters are disillusioned. Its politicians have struggled to muster vigorous opposition to President Trump.\n\nBut tonight — and on many Tuesday nights for the next few years — the election results might just make it easy to forget about the party’s woes.\n\nAlready, Democrats have fared well in special elections since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. On average, they’ve run 12 percentage points ahead of Kamala Harris’s showing across 11 special elections, according to data collected by The Downballot. This includes flipping two reliably Republican districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe pattern of Democratic strength seems likely to continue today, when voters in Florida’s First and Sixth Districts go to the polls to replace Matt Gaetz and the beleaguered national security adviser Michael Waltz. Democrats are not expected to win these races, but there’s every indication of a competitive race in the Sixth District, where Mr. Trump won by 30 points in November. Democrats have even more reason for optimism in the regularly scheduled election for Supreme Court in Wisconsin.",

But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "title": "The Movie That Missed Peak Woke",
        "source": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",
        "content": "Society hit “peak woke” sometime before 2025—but Disney’s new live-action Snow White missed the memo. This remake of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a tribute to inclusivity, girl power, quirky “theater kids”—really anything but the original’s spirit or plot—and audiences are not enchanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who enjoy a classic princess love story, expect to feel stupid. Lead actress Rachel Zegler considers such plots outdated. In a now-infamous 2022 interview with Extra TV, she slammed the 1937 version, saying, “There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird!” The new film, she bragged, is “really not about the love story at all,” calling the shift “really, really wonderful.” Instead, it’s an “inner journey” about Snow White finding her “true self.”\n\nEven before these comments, Zegler was considered controversial. Critics questioned why an actress of Colombian descent was playing a character famously described as having “skin as white as snow”—a debate reminiscent of that surrounding Halle Bailey’s casting as Ariel in Disney’s 2023 live-action Little Mermaid.\n\nBut setting the race debate aside, Zegler’s comments alienated not just nostalgic Disney fans, but also anyone who still appreciates traditional gender roles—a contingent that might actually be growing in the “soft-girl era.” This online movement celebrates ultra-femininity, emotional vulnerability, and self-care, often as a gentle rebellion against hustle culture and hyper-independence—and aligns well with the doe-eyed version of Snow White in the original. In contrast, Disney’s postmodernism downplays the concepts of royalty or hierarchy, emphasizes characters’ “relatability,” and deconstructs traditional patriarchal narrative structures—promoting strong, independent women who don’t need a prince or long-lost father to save them.\n\nAnd Snow White’s love interest reflects this shift, too. Gone is the stoic, chivalrous prince. Instead, we get Jonathan: an irreverent peasant who leads a merry band of misfits. He’s less Prince Charming and more Lin-Manual Miranda, the living embodiment of Kyle Gordon’s new song “We Will Never Die.” To top it off, he delivers most of his lines with the smug cadence of millennial catchphrases like “we did a thing.” All he’s missing is an inscribed graphic t-shirt: “I’ll save the princess. But first, coffee.”\n\nThen there’s the music. Where the 1937 Snow White featured unique songs tailored to an operatic soprano (Adriana Caselotti), giving the film a timeless fairytale quality, the 2025 version opts for bland, hyper-produced pop engineered for a Spotify playlist of girl-power anthems. While Zegler does have a beautiful voice, the songs feel like they were born in a corporate focus group. Hollow and generic, they’re the audio equivalent of stock imagery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while the film touts its inclusiveness, there’s one glaring omission. Despite casting actors of every race and background—even in roles where they don’t align with the original character descriptions—it declined to cast actual human beings to play the iconic seven dwarfs. Instead, the roles were filled by CGI characters, a move that erased a rare opportunity for actors with dwarfism to land major, visible roles in a blockbuster film.\n\nThis decision followed comments from actor Peter Dinklage, who criticized the remake in 2022, calling it a “f***ing backward story about seven dwarves living in a cave together.” But not everyone in the dwarfism community agreed. Dylan Postl, a professional wrestler and actor with dwarfism, pushed back, questioning how the seven dwarfs differed from Dinklage’s role in Elf and writing, “I don’t get why he hates to see other short actors take similar roles, especially in a Disney film that comes with guaranteed success.”\n\nIn trying to avoid offense, Disney ended up excluding the very community the original story spotlighted and bowing to Dinklage’s “privilege,” to borrow the woke language of the very people the film hoped to please.\n\nThat miscalculation didn’t just cost seven actors a job; it also cost Disney a shot at a cohesive, well-paced film. In response to Dinklage’s criticism, Disney initially scrapped the classic seven dwarves and replaced them with Jonathan’s diverse, ragtag band of forest-dwelling outcasts. But that move provoked backlash, and Disney appeared to pivot once again—hastily re-adding scenes with CGI-rendered dwarves. The result? Two overlapping groups of seven supporting characters, each competing for narrative space. The structure feels lopsided and disjointed, the product of a studio caught between two irreconcilable visions.\n\nYoung audiences are unimpressed by all of this. On TikTok, the reaction has been swift and brutal. “Hey so let’s just keep the same plot,” one commenter wrote. “If [Zegler] hated snow white, why did she sign up?” another asked. The box office numbers reflect this antipathy: the $250 million film which was projected to make $50 million during opening weekend fell short by $7 million, drawing lukewarm reviews.\n\nAnd the fact that the film lost revenue wasn’t missed by those behind the scenes either. Zegler’s remarks didn’t just spark fan backlash—they also stirred frustration within the industry. Jonah Platt, son of Snow White producer Marc Platt, publicly criticized the actress for prioritizing personal politics over professional responsibility. In a now-deleted post, he wrote: “Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew…. Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged.” His point hits harder than most internet outrage: in trying to position herself as morally superior, Zegler may have compromised the very project she was hired to uplift.\n\nThe Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs of 1937 will stand the test of time for its operatic grandeur, its timeless depiction of innocence and vulnerability, and its scintillating embrace of gender polarity. But the Snow White of 2025 is millennial-coded to a cringe-inducing degree. Already dated by the time it hit theaters, this movie should have accepted the rise of the soft-girl era. Instead, it will go the way of skinny jeans, side parts, and millennial burger joints.\n\nEditor’s note: This piece has been updated to include the comments from Jon Platt.",

        "content": "Declan Ganley, the Irish telecommunications magnate and European federalist, sat down with The American Conservative to talk about the present trials and future opportunities of Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transcript below is lightly edited for clarity.\n\nYou have said that there is a chance for a long-term, epochal [Russia-Ukraine] peace deal in Europe and that the Americans would be “the lowest barrier” in achieving it. Can Trump still steer events towards this outcome? How could he overcome the highest barriers posed by Europe, Ukraine, and Russia? Can this be reconciled with another key goal: preventing Russia from becoming a vassal of China?\n\nI think Trump can steer events towards this outcome. To steer effectively, one has to know one’s end destination and I think (and hope) that Trump’s end destination is a realignment of the world order so that Communist China is thwarted, long term, from what is its clear ambition to set and dominate the world order in accordance with its own values and rules, but mostly rules.\n\nTo overcome barriers, a number of things have to be accomplished. Europe needs to step up and reform, restructure, and indeed re-arm, but not in the manner of the Cold War with Russia as the “enemy.” The massive challenge is this: Can Russia and Ukraine be brought in as part of an overall peace settlement? A settlement that has lasting effect and that removes the causes and instinct to war between the parties?\n\nThe Franco-German relationship post-WWII is a good example of how this can come about, and we already have the guts of institutions that could be reformed to accommodate such a settlement. I’ll tell you a path that I first drafted shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I have updated it a few times since then, but the general strategy has been the same from the outset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did discuss this path with some prominent and good people in Europe and the U.S., but their take on it at the time was that it was too early for leaders to even contemplate such a thing and that there would need to be a lot of attrition before people would be ready to accept the need for such dramatic change. While one can say that it was an appalling opinion, it was also one that fully understood the realpolitik of the situation. I think Trump’s strategy can be helpful in that it has catalyzed the environment necessary for big changes to be made. We could have had another few years of attrition and that would have been an horrendous tragedy in the loss of so many more young lives on the battlefield.\n\nHere is my thinking and my plan:\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia are full members of the European Union. Both Russia and Ukraine are members of the Northern Hemisphere Treaty Organization (NHTO), which is a restructuring of NATO to bring in Russia, with the byproduct of removing Russians from the Chinese military orbit and protecting it from the PRC [People’s Republic of China]. NHTO’s Supreme Commander Allied Forces Europe is a job held for five years at a time. Out of every 20 years, 15 will be led by an American, five by a Russian.\n\nThis treaty should have at least a 100-year term. The European Union will have established a bicameral legislature. The existing European Parliament will be the lower house (with members from Russia and Ukraine added) and a European upper house/senate will balance out the larger member countries vs the smaller countries with an equal number of senators from each EU member.\n\nRussia will keep Crimea, the Kursk salient will immediately return to Russia, while the Donbas will remain part of Ukraine. The areas of the Donbas occupied by Russia as of January 1, 2025 will be administered by an international peacekeeping force until 2030 and shall then come under regular Ukrainian administration within the EU.\n\nThe above settlement will require constitutional/treaty change in the EU. This will require referendums in a number of member states. Those referendums should be held rapidly and can be promoted as a “peace and prosperity” referendum, as that is what it would be. The admission of Ukraine to the EU should be completed by January 1st, 2028, with admission of Russia by January 1st 2030. This will require both countries to align their economies and regulatory structures to be as EU-compliant as possible by those accession dates. Some other changes may need to be made in the symbols and ceremony of this reformed European Union to incorporate the significance of the addition of Russia and Ukraine, which would expand ‘Europe’ from the West of Ireland to the Bering Strait.\n\nWhy do this? What are the wins? The war ends permanently, and the causes of war are removed; the border between Ukraine and Russia becomes as open as the border today between France and Germany or France and Belgium. China’s designs on Russia are stymied. China’s effort to divide the West fails. Russia secures its eastern flank. Zelensky saves Ukraine, keeps it sovereign and independent and brings it into the EU. Putin achieves what Peter the Great failed to achieve and brings Russia into \"the West\" while adding to Russia’s prestige by recognizing its central importance to the security and preservation of Western civilization. Russia will have made the ancient symbol of the double-headed Eagle facing East and West a reality. Russia also opens up its economy to major investment and development as a full EU member. America is locked in as the military leader of the NHTO alliance and the alliance can credibly contain even a much stronger Communist China for the next century.\n\nWere this to happen, Russia would very clearly not be a vassal of China; it would be very much part of a new Europe and in a long-term alliance with the U.S. and would be a sister country of Ukraine within the European family. There can be no doubt that Russia would have a major voice in Europe, as does France and Germany. The scope for economic growth and innovation here is epoch-changing in its potential.\n\nThat’s a bold, intellectually courageous vision, and our Western political class is not well-versed in long-term thinking, so I’m not sure about their responsiveness. You’ve remarked on X that “the chat about the US leaving NATO may seem clever, but it’s unwise.” How would you make the case to America for staying in the alliance? Realistically speaking, are Europeans capable of reducing the asymmetry in the security burden? Or do they have a deeply ingrained conviction, despite virtue signaling on the Ukraine war, that they live in a permanently low-threat world?\n\nI’m not focused on what responsiveness might be. We have a very big, and I believe civilizational, existential question which needs a comprehensive answer. That answer, if it is going to work, is going to be difficult, but not completely impossible, for all sides to swallow. It has to be grand in scale; baby steps are more likely to end up on land mines than sunlit uplands. We need to make a leap for the uplands and perhaps we will make it, perhaps we won’t, but this is the time to take bold risks and cast aside this constant quest for low-risk “certainty,” which has led us to the mess we are in.\n\nWith respect to my remarks regarding the U.S. potentially leaving NATO, I think the extent to which the post-war order has been destabilized in Europe prevents us from fully appreciating how powerful American NATO membership and leadership have been in securing peace on the continent. America has built an enormous store of value, and it paid for it dearly on the beaches of Normandy, in the air over wartime Europe, and in the convoy lanes of the cold North Atlantic. It removed the causes of war in most of Europe, fostering harmony, particularly within all of the militaries of Europe, and it built an enormous store of trust and cultural reach. The economic stability and growth that sprung from that has made the whole world more prosperous very much including America. It’s also likely saved incalculably vast numbers of lives.\n\nAmerica is a vast continental power, and so is Europe. Though at the moment the latter is economically lethargic and militarily insignificant, history suggests it will not always remain that way. The explosive Middle East and North Africa is on Europe’s own lake, Mare Nostrum, the Mediterranean, or to follow a fashion, the Gulf of Europe. Whether it likes it or not, Europe is destined to be an active participant in those regions, because those regions are going to continue to have great effect on Europe.\n\nStrategically, America is probably a lot better off in a large Northern hemisphere security alliance than out of it. Indeed, for its own interest, America should want the chair in any such military alliance, so it can always keep at least one hand on the tiller. There might also be an American interest to have both Japan and South Korea join a Northern Hemisphere Treaty Organization.\n\nI could also see an equal European (including Ukraine and Russia) interest. America remaining in NATO probably makes NHTO easier to bring about, unless one wanted to argue that American withdrawal from NATO and the inevitable resultant unwinding of its current structures would make a new NHTO alliance more palatable to join for Russia. I think it would be unnecessary institutional vandalism; these things take decades to build. Restructure, reform—don’t destroy. When I was younger, there was a time Russians openly talked about wanting to join NATO and even the European Union. It was a different time and, in my opinion, a squandered opportunity, but Russian membership of a restructured and renamed NATO does not have to be a bridge too far, as long as they are fully integrated into it.\n\nI do think Europeans are capable of reducing the asymmetry. There are huge efficiencies to be found via greater harmonization on security and defense. Europe gets a lot less bang for its buck than America does because European planning, equipment, and procurement are so atomized between European countries. Fix that and we are quickly headed in the right direction. Spending is one thing, effectiveness and lethality another. That’s a question for another time, but what capability Europe and the U.S. get for their money is much more important than how much they pay for it. A NHTO alliance would fundamentally change the calculus, allowing for far greater efficiencies and far greater effectiveness. As for Europeans thinking they continue to live in a low-threat world, that comfy blanket has gone through a shredder in the last couple of years, I doubt that mentality can remain pervasive for very much longer. If it does, the age of Europe will be over.\n\nJ.D. Vance delivered a great, historic speech in Munich. He stated that European elites are afraid of their own people. Wasn't the Lisbon Treaty, which you campaigned against, driven by fear of European nations? The aim of this treaty was, de facto, to override the results of the 2005 referendum, when the Dutch and French, despite a massive media offensive, rejected the Constitution for Europe. What did you learn from that campaign? Hasn't Europe's democratic deficit only grown since then?\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty, which was a rebranding of the European Constitution and was voted down in French and Dutch referenda, and then subsequently by the Irish in 2008, is a constitutional formula for Europe which is prescriptive. It is a large book, hundreds of pages. It is impenetrable because it was designed to be impenetrable. It is not a script for free peoples, or for a free single market, or for a strong Europe with what Georgia Meloni would call a “millennial vision.” The Lisbon Treaty is the dead hand of bureaucracy in a rigor-mortis grip around the throat of Europe’s future.\n\nI waged the Irish campaign against the Lisbon Treaty precisely because I had read it, all of it, and it was crystal clear to me that it would drag Europe in a wrong direction. It sought to vest power in a giant bureaucracy that had no real levers of democratic control. Certainly, it can be argued that there is certain democratic consultation, but it’s window dressing. What’s more, everyone in Brussels knows it’s window dressing and admits so in private. What it did is free the giant bureaucracy from the need to win over Europe’s peoples. It failed to ask them to grant a mandate for a shared vision. It didn’t lead or inspire; it hid in a cave and plotted. Worst of all, it lacked real ambition. The Lisbon Treaty ensured that no European demos could form, though I don’t believe that was the intent or that it was even thought through.\n\nSo yes, Europe’s democratic deficit has grown since then. Back in 2008 and 2009, I said that the Lisbon Treaty formula, if implemented, would cause lethargic growth, would not foster European innovation, would not provide European security and that we could see member states end up leaving the European Union. I also said it would not provide for the unity of Europe on things that mattered to ordinary Europeans. It failed to engage them properly at the democratic level. In 2008/9 I even did a book on the subject with Irish journalist the late Bruce Arnold. The title was The Fight for Democracy. Unfortunately, I was right with respect to my most serious concerns.\n\nIn that same period and in the short few years following, I also predicted the Kremlin’s expansionism because it was clear to me that there was not going to be anything credible to stop them, to set them on a different course, or indeed to provide for a lasting peace with Russia.\n\nWhat I learned from that campaign was that certain European elites, at least back then, had no real interest in making Europe great. No real interest in building prosperity or elevating the place of family, or in making Europe the most secure, beautiful, and prosperous place on earth. They had no notion of how such objectives might be achieved, far less about how Europe might be led to achieve them. They were focused on smaller things, sinecures, enhancing their own personal prestige and position, and the perception of holding power even if that ironically meant trading away power to the bureaucracy. It was what I called then a “tyranny of mediocrity.”\n\nI also learned that it did not matter what I thought or what I said about a vision for Europe, it only mattered what the then-powerful media organs said I thought. They sought to turn me, a European federalist who treasures and understands the value of national state sovereignty and tradition, into the image of what they labeled an “anti-European.” It was bizarre, twilight-zone stuff. But it was a very valuable lesson. So was the fact that they made Ireland vote on the Lisbon Treaty twice, because they decided we gave the wrong answer the first time.\n\nOne indication that we are entering a new era is the sudden realization of how much the world of bits depends on the world of atoms. We take the internet for granted. However, it relies entirely on undersea cables, which are under increasing strain and are becoming ever more frequent targets of adversarial actors. You and your company, Rivada, are working to make the internet more resilient in an era of global fragmentation. Tell us about Rivada’s mission. How do you see the relationship between technology and independence evolving in the 21st century?\n\nI see the relationship between technology and independence as completely interdependent. If the technology we rely upon in our daily lives and interactions is controlled or can become controllable by those that don’t share our values, or worse still, by those that would seek to undermine us and set the rules of how we associate with each other, then we will not have independence.\n\nMy company, Rivada, has designed and is working to deploy what we call the “Outernet.” Rivada’s space-based Outernet will be the world’s first completely self-contained global private network that can connect any point on earth to any other point without having to touch the internet or anyone else’s network. Rivada is building the world’s first unified, global, self-contained high-speed network.\n\nToday, the world is connected via a patchwork of networks. Some are more trustworthy than others, but as the recent and continuing revelations about Salt Typhoon are exposing, even supposedly reliable network operators have virtually all been infiltrated, compromised, or hacked.\n\nThe internet—designed as a “network of networks” some 60 years ago—has been a brilliant innovation. But it was not designed with modern security threats or today’s geopolitical environment in mind. Data sent across the internet passes through a series of nodes with the sole aim of reaching its destination efficiently. And for cat pictures and Netflix series, that works well. Better than that—it’s brilliant. It’s changed the world utterly over the past 30 years.\n\nThe other commercial LEO constellations being built today share one thing in common—they are designed to connect their users to the internet. Data goes up from the user’s dish to a satellite in low-Earth orbit and then back down to a gateway that sends it on its way across the network-of-networks that is the Internet.\n\nRivada’s Outernet, by contrast, is designed to keep user data off the Internet. It is a globe-spanning network of fully interconnected satellites capable of transmitting customer data between any two points on the planet without passing through any intermediate networks. And strange as it is say, this is completely unique.\n\nOn your bits and atoms point, they both matter, a lot. Europe’s potential enemies will likely want to rapidly take away, compromise, or denude any advantage that bits might offer. We have seen a highly sophisticated and well-resourced effort to capture control of the delivery systems for Europe’s cyber domain.\n\nI was vociferous in my objections to allowing Huawei’s infiltration into Europe’s cellular communications networks. In recent days, we seen the arrest of people across Europe connected with Huawei’s influence campaign to achieve their European objectives.\n\nIf you can denude or compromise the advantage of bits, atoms get much more important. In Ukraine we see once again that metal on metal delivered kinetically still shifts the balance, and here mass industrial production and logistics matter. Then consider that, in 2023, Chinese steel production was eight times greater than that of all of Europe, 1.019 billion tons vs 126.3 million tons of crude steel. China’s share of global steel production was 54 percent, while Europe’s was 6.7 percent, and dropping. If you look at history, there has never been a peer on near-peer war where the smaller steel producer ended up winning. It’s a sobering thought. So is the fact that China is stockpiling vast quantities of steel in warehouses.\n\nPresident Trump once said, “If you have no steel, you have no country.” Recent history offers a few striking examples of rapid industrialization, primarily in East Asia. However, Trump 47 aims to achieve something unprecedented: reindustrializing the world's most advanced economy. I see this effort as necessary, but do you think it is feasible? Does the fate of the Western world depend on its ability to rebuild its manufacturing potential?\n\nYes, I think it’s feasible and yes, I think the fate of the Western world depends on the speed of American and European re-industrialization in manufacturing and on deregulation in the areas of crucial services and resources. So we need to start making raw steel again, copper, aluminum, building ships and applying state-of-the-art tech to make that process faster and more efficient. We need to free up the constraints placed on wireless spectrum resources in the West, constraints that have allowed China to steal a march in such a pivotally important domain as wireless and cyber. We also have to smash the crony corporatism that has captured the regulatory state and harnessed it to protect powerful oligopolies and even monopolies and has ended up starving the innovator/disruptor economy of the resources that would otherwise be available to it.\n\nWe have to make stuff, and we don’t have to do it the way we did before. We have to do it smarter, more cost effectively and faster. I believe that’s possible. I know it’s doable and I am certain that it is existential in its necessity.\n\nIt is essential for our security, it is essential because human kind, in my opinion, is duty bound to strive to always be better, to advance, to be responsible stewards of our contract with future generations as well as our contract with those gone before us, to harness the resources of our planet, to strive for the stars and build the industrial and technological capability of becoming an interplanetary species and eventually an inter galactic one. That can only happen over the scale of many generations. It’s the way Christendom built its cathedrals. We have done it before. With will, determination, and enlightened motivated leadership, we can do it again.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation Wednesday announcing a new set of tariffs on imported automobiles and automobile parts. The tariffs, which are aimed at foreign-produced passenger vehicles, light trucks, and certain key automotive parts, are intended to strengthen America’s industrial base and protect U.S. automotive manufacturing jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tariff will have a major impact on the market for new cars—in 2024, about 50 percent of the 16 million new cars purchased in the U.S. were manufactured abroad, and cars manufactured domestically often contain a significant number of imported components. Will Scharf, a White House aid, estimated that the tariff would bring in close to $100 billion dollars in revenue.\n\nTrump has suggested that the new tariffs could be implemented before next Wednesday. “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days,” he said, “and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs.”\n\nApril 2 is the day Trump plans to roll out his program of reciprocal tariffs, in which the U.S. will impose additional duties on all countries that penalize the importation of American goods. The exact nature of the reciprocal tariff plan has not yet been released; the president has suggested that “there’ll be flexibility” and said on Tuesday night that the tariffs will be more “lenient than reciprocal.”\n\nApril 2 is also the day the White House will also impose a 25 percent tariff on any country that buys Venezuelan oil, a measure the president is taking to pressure a hostile Maduro government that Trump says is sending members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang to the U.S.",

        "source": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",
        "content": "Some veterans of the Afghanistan war are lobbying fiercely in Washington to resume admitting Afghan migrants, a process that the Trump administration has currently frozen. Many of these veterans are associated with an advocacy coalition called AfghanEvac, which maintains that America’s national honor will be stained if any Afghan allies are left behind under the Taliban. How many Afghans this coalition wants to bring to the United States is unclear, but the fact that we have already resettled some 200,000 Afghans appears to be, for this coalition, just a down payment on a debt that they believe America owes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile AfghanEvac talks about America’s honor vis-à-vis these foreign nationals, the coalition would have President Donald Trump go back on his word to his voters, arguably his strongest campaign promise, to end our country’s unprecedented migration chaos. As AfghanEvac lobbies Congress and the White House for more migrants, the president is deeply engaged in cleaning up the national security and rule-of-law catastrophe caused by the Biden administration in opening the border to some 8.3 million foreigners. The 200,000 Afghans, admitted in 2021–24, were part of that chaos. The Biden administration poorly vetted these migrants and failed to confirm that they even helped the American cause in the war.\n\nA closer examination of AfghanEvac reveals that it consists not just of U.S. veterans, although they are in the lead, but it also includes America’s professional open-border lobby: NGOs that are fundamentally anti-Trump and represent a key constituency of the Biden presidency. These are the same NGOs that received literal billions in federal subsidies from the Biden administration and never saw a foreign national population that they did not want to relocate into the United States. Republican Congressmen and conservatives sympathetic to AfghanEvac should ask these veterans why they are making common cause with these open-border, far-left NGOs.\n\nThe anti-Trump organizations include groups like Human Rights First; the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights; Church World Service; U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants; and the Biden administration’s signature open-borders group, “Welcome.US.” All of these NGOs were co-conspirators and abettors of President Joe Biden’s deliberate attack on the nation’s normal immigration laws, labor markets, and social service systems all across the country. Not only did these same groups attempt to legitimize Biden’s migration lawlessness; they siphoned off scandalous salaries and perks from the billions of federal subsidies that the Biden administration doled out as political payoffs.\n\nOne of the AfghanEvac coalition members is an outfit known as Innovation Law Lab, which asserts:\n\nLike you, we are frustrated by the persistent exclusion of immigrants from civil society, the for-profit detention and deportation system, the immoral and inhumane restrictions on movement, and the unrelenting assault on those fleeing persecution. By scaling the impact of immigrant advocates working on-the-ground to defeat the Vast Deportation Machine, we are able to build permanent pathways to immigrant and refugee justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans in Congress should ask AfghanEvac leaders to research how many lawsuits the Innovation Law Lab has helped bring against the Trump administration to keep illegal migrants, including criminal terrorists like Tren de Aragua gang members, in our country.\n\nAfghanEvac’s far-left partners marshal all of the radical Biden arguments to keep America’s borders open: they point to climate change, white supremacy, and the supposed absolute right of foreigners to enter our country. Groups like Human Rights First and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights are all about ending the Trump administration’s Remain in Mexico policies and legalizing illegal migrants.\n\nIn fairness, most of the AfghanEvac veterans are probably not sympathetic with the radicals in these open-border NGOs. But still these veterans must acknowledge, when they lobby Republican Congressmen and White House officials, that AfghanEvac is in an unholy alliance with groups dedicated to undermining Trump’s core policies. While some in the AfghanEvac coalition, perhaps, have relatively modest goals—for example, just to process all Afghans with putative claims to special immigrant visas (SIVs)—their partners in the refugee and resettlement lobby are licking their chops to process hundreds of thousands, even millions, of new Afghan migrants. That is something President Trump should never permit to happen.\n\nWe must recognize that it is out of high principle that the veterans remain bound to the Afghan translator, the driver, the intelligence operative who risked his life to work with U.S. soldiers, marines, spies, and diplomats. Americans acknowledge the deep ties of fellowship that are forged in war-time. But this sentiment cannot be the basis, post-Biden, of another immigration wave. The many tens of thousands of such personal commitments Americans made to Afghans must be measured in the context of the long-term U.S. national interest.\n\nThe original U.S. military incursion into Afghanistan had nothing to do with the well-being of the Afghans. Washington policymakers, of both parties, morphed our country’s 2001 counterterrorism mission to kill Osama Bin Laden and destroy Al Qaeda into a foolhardy two-decade nation-building project. Today, most Americans might reasonably conclude that merely undertaking that mammoth 20-year enterprise, an effort that claimed the lives of almost 2,500 of our countrymen, more than fulfilled any obligations that Uncle Sam has to the remote Central Asian country.\n\nThose veterans committed to AfghanEvac might consider redefining the discharge of their perceived obligations by other means than encouraging migration to the United States. There is much to be said for private initiatives that deliver money and material support for Afghans to stay and fight for their country, to go underground to outlast the Taliban. Afghans waiting in third countries can be helped to reinfiltrate back to their native soil. Why is the only honorable “solution” facilitating Afghans to abandon their homeland for an alien country where they can drive an Uber or open up a restaurant?\n\nYes, Afghanistan is a complicated, multi-tribal, multi-ethnic country, but one also with strong traditions of survival and resistance that outlasted the British Empire and Soviet occupation. There is at least a plausible argument that Afghanistan will be better off in the long run if all our allies remain, resist, and hold out for their country’s future. If the United States were sinking into oppression, most AfghanEvac veterans, even facing a national situation as bleak as Afghanistan’s, would not respond by emigrating to Canada.\n\nFinally, the veterans must acknowledge that the U.S. government does not have the capacity to reliably vet the Afghans who have already entered our country, not to mention all those who would seek to come. Discharging the American debt to Afghanistan certainly does not require our country to run unacceptably high risks of admitting terrorists and criminals. When they are lobbying, AfghanEvac advocates must address the fact that U.S. government vetting is seriously inadequate and vulnerable to error at such a level that the risk of admitting Afghan enemies or criminals remains too high.\n\nThe Trump administration is right to permanently halt refugees and migrants coming from Afghanistan. Trump is right to defund Biden’s corrupt refugee and resettlement lobby. He is right to keep his pledge to the American people in the 2024 campaign. That is the highest American honor at stake in all of this business.",

        "source": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",
        "content": "What have become of my Royal Tenenbaums?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last few years, a series of seemingly unrelated events have conspired to make me consider with grim perplexity the fate of the cast of one of the favorite movies from my vanished youth, Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums.\n\nI was 18 when I first saw—and saw and saw again—The Royal Tenenbaums, which, in its remarkably close approximation of the J.D. Salinger short stories I had gobbled up as an adolescent, played like a cinematic transcription of my imagination. The movie offered an immensely appealing vision of genteel cosmopolitanism: The fictitious Tenenbaums were a brood of well-off but listless one-time enfants terribles who rattled around their Manhattan brownstone with their mink coats, perfectly turned phrases, and infinite treasury of troubles.\n\nEach of the spawn of Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum (the parents played by the late Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston) began life as would-be virtuosos: Chas was a financial impresario, Margot a playwright of accomplishment, Richie an ace tennis player. But the trio of Tenenbaum siblings failed to capitalize on their early promise.\n\n“In fact, virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums had been erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster,” says the film’s narrator—played, significantly, by an unseen Alec Baldwin.\n\nNow to the point behind this reminiscence: I confess that my mind turned to Baldwin’s ominous assessment of the outcomes experienced by the imaginary Tenenbaums when watching the actor’s own very real reality show, The Baldwins on TLC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf ever a program represented the downfall of a once-notable talent, this is it. The show was seemingly dreamt up to boost the flagging public image of Baldwin, who was then in the midst of criminal proceedings that resulted from a truly awful accident on the set of a movie: In 2021, while shooting the Western Rust, Baldwin’s prop gun discharged a bullet that resulted in the death of the cinematographer. (The charges were dismissed while the trial was underway last summer.) The Baldwins works overtime to showcase the softer side of its star, but when compared against his once-impressive movie career, it is pretty tepid stuff: Alec has gone from costarring with Sean Connery in The Hunt for Red October to giving the folks at home a tour of his closet. How the mighty have fallen.\n\nThat’s when it occurred to me: Many of the Tenenbaums have lost some of their royal sheen in recent years.\n\nLet us take the case of Gwyneth Paltrow, who played, with great indolent charm, the adult version of Margot Tenenbaum. Since she appeared in The Royal Tenenbaums some twenty-four years ago, Paltrow has starred in a grand total of three movies for which I have purchased a ticket: 2002’s Possession (a ho-hum literary adaptation), 2003’s Sylvia (a creditable biopic of Sylvia Plath), and 2005’s Proof (a ho-hum theatrical adaptation). I have missed (or avoided) the entire corpus of Iron Man. So inconsequential is Paltrow’s post-Margot screen career that my most vivid recollection of her from the last quarter century is her “appearance” in a 2023 civil trial in which a skiing eye doctor asserted that she bore responsibility for a ski collision some years back. The goofy legal proceedings were televised, etching in my memory her scoffing expression as the plaintiff gave his version of events and her supercilious answer on the stand when asked about how the incident in question had affected her: “Well, I lost half a day of skiing.”\n\nThen there is the matter of Hackman—Mr. Royal Tenenbaum himself. Having long ago called it quits on his screen career, Hackman made his permanent home in Arizona in what everyone assumed was complete contentment—“assumed” because he seldom made himself available, post-retirement, to the press. After all, hadn’t the star of The French Connection, Hoosiers, and Unforgiven earned the right to while away his golden years without the inquiries of reporters or agents? But, in the fullness of time, it turned out that Hackman had perhaps too much solitude: In late February, the bodies of Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were discovered in their home after having died at some ill-defined earlier point. Authorities later disclosed that Hackman was felled by heart disease—some number of days after his wife had perished after contracting hantavirus. All endings are sad, but this was one both sad and strange.\n\nWhat about the rest of the cast? Well, Luke Wilson—aka Richie Tenenbaum—was unable to replicate the cinematic success of his sibling Owen Wilson, though Owen, a mere supporting player in The Royal Tenenbaums, hasn’t exactly lit the world on fire lately: If you had heard of his recent movies Bliss (2021), Marry Me (2022), or Secret Headquarters (2022), you were one step ahead of me. I grant that appearing in little-seen motion pictures is not so cruel a destiny as facing a criminal trial, like Baldwin; or making a fool of yourself in a civil trial, like Paltrow.\n\nAm I saying that the cast of The Royal Tenenbaums is cursed? Not quite. My point is more prosaic: Not even glamorous and successful movie stars who had starred in what seemed like a charmed movie are exempt from the fickle finger of fate.\n\n“Betrayal, failure, and disaster” were the words Baldwin used to describe the Tenenbaums. Phew—he was more right than he knew.",

        "content": "Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s conservative Rassemblement National party and the frontrunner in the nation’s 2027 presidential election, has been barred from running for office for the next five years after a trial for the misappropriation of public funds. Le Pen has also been sentenced to face a large 100,000 euro fine and four years of imprisonment, though the latter will consist of two years of house arrest and two years of a suspended sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial stemmed from Le Pen’s role as a member of the European Parliament, when she employed aides who the court alleged were working for her party rather than for the European Parliament. The court explicitly stated that none of the funds were used for personal gain or enrichment by Le Pen.\n\nMuch as with last year’s Trump trial, Le Pen’s trial has been politically charged. Le Pen, and the increasingly popular RN (which won 40 percent of vote in last year’s parliamentary elections and is the largest party in France’s parliament), are the bête noire of France’s political establishment, and many within that establishment have viewed the trial as a means of preventing Le Pen from winning the 2027 presidential race, in which Le Pen was the clear frontrunner.\n\nWithin France, the verdict has been criticized by some of those usually hostile to Le Pen, most notably by Jean-Luc Mélonchon, the leader of France’s hard-left La France Insoumise party, one of the chief rivals of Le Pen’s RN. “The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people,” Mélonchon commented on the verdict.\n\nLaurent Wauquiez, the leader of the establishment-right La Droite Républicaine group in the French parliament, also condemned the ruling, stating that it would “weigh very heavily on the functioning of our democracy.”\n\nVarious populist leaders from around Europe, from Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Italy’s Matteo Salvini have responded to the verdict, with messages in strong support of Le Pen.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?”\n\nBig Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X.\n\nRamaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.”\n\nThe resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters.\n\nA Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process.\n\nBut what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it?\n\nReframing the Debate\n\nThe H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people.\n\nAt the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.)\n\nWhile the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies.\n\nThere are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers.\n\nA permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process.\n\nOnce naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program.\n\nThis is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration.\n\nA Half Century of Mass Immigration\n\nWe've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic.\n\nNaturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program.\n\nAstonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy.\n\nThat doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story.\n\nImporting Experts or the Huddled Masses?\n\nThe H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.”\n\n“Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans.\n\nSpeaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April.\n\nThe number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S.\n\nInfosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance.\n\nIt's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees.\n\nNot surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners.\n\n“I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her.\n\nWhile U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?”\n\nOther H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.”\n\nAgain, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America.\n\nAt least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented.\n\nEvery year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees.\n\nWily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave.\n\nCritics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.”\n\nNot only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example:\n\nH1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse.\n\nThen there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.”\n\nThere are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems.\n\nBut defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year.\n\nThese are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs?\n\nTechpocalypse and the GOP\n\nThat's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity.\n\nRecent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs.\n\nThat's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025.\n\nA jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers.\n\n“There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.”\n\nThe center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes.\n\n“If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nImmigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period.\n\nThe discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here.\n\nCredit: U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services\n\nSixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality.\n\nNor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64.\n\nEven without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years.\n\nCredit: U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services\n\nThis is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.\n\nThe H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)?\n\nFor MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world.",

        "title": "Trump Pushes Sheinbaum Away From AMLO’s Cartel Policies",
        "source": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",
        "content": "Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has quietly been abandoning the security framework of her predecessor, the populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador. López Obrador famously took a soft-touch approach towards cartels in Mexico, saying that ultimately what would solve organized crime are “hugs, not bullets,” a statement which became the motto for the security plan used by Mexico during his six-year tenure as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis approach was based on the argument that cartel crime is ultimately motivated by economic inequality and instability and thus the correct way to reduce cartel violence is to provide young people with housing, education, and economic opportunities. This was a strong political position for López Obrador to take, as it provided additional justification for all sorts of welfare programs that he hoped to implement to reduce inequality among Mexicans. But the administration did put in place a number of programs explicitly aimed at improving youth education and economic opportunities, such as Young People Building the Future, a government jobs program that provides significant pay and benefits for Mexicans aged 18–29 that are not otherwise working or in school.\n\nThe main problem with the approach was that it completely failed at transforming the landscape of organized crime in Mexico, for fairly obvious reasons. López Obrador’s contention is not entirely without merit; many young people do go into organized crime for economic reasons. But those reasons are not solely related to desperation and poverty. The drug trade is immensely lucrative, offering a higher salary than the legal side of either the Mexican public or private sector can reasonably afford. Government welfare programs can prevent poverty, but joining a cartel can make you rich.\n\nThe light touch from the Mexican government, coupled with opportunities created by the Biden administration’s lack of enforcement at America’s southern border, allowed the cartels to flourish over the past several years. Mexicans have paid the price. Homicides in Mexico reached record highs under López Obrador in 2020, and although official murder rates declined slightly over the six years of his presidency, they remain historically high. Worse yet, much of that decline may be illusory, as Mexico has suffered rapid growth of missing persons cases. In 2023, there were over 100,000 people missing in the country, many of whom were likely victims of cartel violence whose bodies have not yet been found.\n\nThe astonishing spectacle of cartel brutality has become increasingly prominent in Mexican politics. Some states, like Sonora and Chihuahua, have become virtual war zones—in 2024, both saw an average of more than 100 murders every month, primarily the result of organized crime. Shootouts between rival cartels have become common, with civilian victims caught in the crossfire. Nor are the cartels hesitant to flex their muscle politically when it becomes convenient: The savage murder of the mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of the crime-ridden state of Guerrero, shocked the nation last October. Just six days after the mayor was elected on a promise to crack down on crime in the city, he was found dead in his car, his head chopped off and placed on top of the vehicle as a grim warning to other potential reformers.\n\nAnger at the effects of organized crime has become steadily more salient, as Mexicans tire of the depredations of cartels and gang members. This is one reason that Sheinbaum, as president, has declined to use the phrase “hugs, not bullets” to describe her own political program. Her change in approach is not merely rhetorical. While Sheinbaum maintained a focus on welfare and youth assistance, adding her own signature plan to vastly increase housing construction in the country, she also proposed a new security plan that focuses on investigation and intelligence to infiltrate cartels and disrupt their activities.\n\nThe fact that cartel violence has become so visible and unpopular is doubtless one reason that Sheinbaum has proven so cooperative with President Donald Trump in his efforts to close down the border and crack down on drug and human trafficking from Mexico into the U.S. Unlike Canada, which has seen a major anti-American backlash from both the populace and the government in response to the U.S. president’s aggressive moves, Mexico has largely taken Trump’s sometimes bewildering pattern of threats and demands in stride, following Sheinbaum’s cool and intentional approach. The Mexican president has handled the situation with impressive tact and control, calmly asserting Mexico’s sovereignty and avoiding any appearance of subordination to the U.S., while also largely providing Trump with everything he has asked for and sometimes more—sending thousands of Mexican troops to the border, cracking down on trafficking, even taking the unprecedented step of extraditing cartel kingpins from Mexican prisons to be tried in American courts. The result has been an unusual situation in which the U.S. has a better working relationship with Mexico than with Canada.\n\nSheinbaum’s security programs still have a long way to go to become truly effective at taking on cartel violence. Faced with a mounting deficit last year, Sheinbaum cut the security services budget significantly for 2025, a decision she may now regret. But she has long since begun tacking away from López Obrador’s lenient treatment of organized crime, and Trump has provided excellent cover for her to do so under the guise of political necessity—something that allows her to avoid a politically costly confrontation with her predecessor’s supporters in the party.\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Sonora and Coahuila had more than 100 murders per month in 2024. Coahuila had only 8.7 murders per month in 2024.",

        "title": "Trump Should Look at the Latest U.S. Intelligence Assessment",
        "source": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",
        "content": "The intelligence community is the eyes and ears of the White House. Presidents only know what it tells them. The most up-to-date intelligence tells President Donald Trump that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Yet Trump continues to threaten war unless Iran agrees to give up the nuclear weapons program that Washington knows Tehran does not have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, the new Trump administration received its first Annual Threat Assessment, which compiles insights from the intelligence community. Looking at Iran’s domestic politics, the report says that, “in the past year, there has been an erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public that has emboldened nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decisionmaking apparatus.” If true, this development is hardly surprising, given Iran’s increasing vulnerability. The report notes “the degradation to [Iran’s] proxies and air defenses during the Gaza conflict” and the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who had been an Iranian ally.\n\nNonetheless, the report says that the intelligence community “continue[s] to assess Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and that [Ayatollah] Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”\n\nThe findings of the Annual Threat Assessment haven’t had a moderating influence on Trump’s rhetoric, which if anything has become only more bellicose. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he told NBC News Saturday evening. On March 7, a couple weeks before the Assessment was published, the president had told FOX Business, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran.” That same day, Trump told reporters, “We’re down to final strokes with Iran…. Final moments. Can’t let them have a nuclear weapon…. Hopefully we can have a peace deal…. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem.\"\n\nIn the FOX Business interview, Trump revealed that he had sent a letter to Khamenei warning that the alternative to diplomacy was war. Barak Ravid of Axios reported that the letter included a two-month deadline for striking a nuclear deal. “[I]f Iran rejects Trump’s outreach and doesn’t negotiate, the chances of U.S. or Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities would dramatically increase,” Ravid wrote.\n\nTrump’s threats are disproportionate to, and inconsistent with, the latest U.S. intelligence. And the Annual Threat Assessment is not the first report that has informed Washington that Iran likely isn’t pursuing a nuclear weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran was completely and consistently in compliance with its commitments under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—the Iran nuclear deal—up until the time that Trump pulled out of it in May 2018.\n\nThe 2022 U.S. Department of Defense Nuclear Posture Review concluded that “Iran does not today possess a nuclear weapon and we currently believe it is not pursuing one.” In 2023, then-CIA Director William Burns said that “[t]o the best of our knowledge, we don’t believe that the supreme leader in Iran has yet made a decision to resume the weaponization program.” A year later, Burns said, “No, we do not see evidence today that the supreme leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program… We don’t see evidence today that such a decision [to build a bomb] has been made. We watch it very carefully.” As recently as this February, even Trump said that, “There are many people at the top ranks of Iran that do not want to have a nuclear weapon.”\n\nIran has resisted U.S. coercion to negotiate. In February, Khamenei pointed to America’s not honoring the JCPOA and said, “One must not negotiate with a government like the US government. Negotiations with it is not wise, it is not intelligent, and is not honorable.” The next month, Khamenei explained further, in a post on X, why Iran isn’t willing to negotiate. “This same US president tore up the signed JCPOA agreement. How could we hold negotiations with US when we know they don’t fulfill their commitments?”\n\nPrior to Trump’s threats, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had advocated for direct negotiations with the United States, and Khamenei had supported him. Now Pezeshkian insists that Iran “will not yield to foreign pressure.” Earlier this month, Pezeshkian responded to U.S. threats by saying, “the language of threats and coercion is absolutely unacceptable… It is unacceptable for someone to come along and say, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that, or else.’ I won’t come to negotiate with you. Go do whatever the hell you want.”\n\nStill, Iran has said that, though direct negotiations with the U.S. are impossible until “there is a change in the other side’s approach towards” Tehran, the “way is open for indirect negotiations.” Last week on Thursday, after Tehran sent its response to Trump’s letter, Iran’s foreign minister reiterated that, \"Our policy is still to not engage in direct negotiations while under maximum pressure and military threats, however, as it was the case in the past, indirect negotiations can continue.”\n\nTrump, rather than lowering the rhetorical pressure, responded on Friday with one of his most ominous threats yet. While reiterating that his “big preference is that we work it out with Iran,” he told reporters in the Oval Office that “if we don’t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.” The next day, in the NBC News interview, he elaborated on what the “very bad things” would be, threatening Iran with “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”\n\nThe open way to indirect negotiations may have recently become much rockier, and not just because of the president’s harsh rhetoric. On CBS’s Face the Nation, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz seemed to say that Iran would have to give up not only the nuclear weapons program that they don’t have but the civilian nuclear program that they do. Waltz said that the U.S. is demanding “full dismantlement.” Iran, Waltz said, “has to give up its program” and stop “enrichment,” seemingly meaning that Tehran must cease enriching uranium even for civilian purposes. “The full program,” he said, “give it up or there will be consequences.” Waltz added that Iran would also have to give up its “strategic missile program.”\n\nIran is unlikely to negotiate the elimination of its missile program. Especially now, with the degradation of its front-line proxy defense, the missile program is a crucial part of Iran’s defense strategy.\n\nThey are also unlikely to negotiate the elimination of their civilian nuclear program. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which declares that “Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.”\n\nIt is not clear how threatening Iran with war benefits the U.S. or the world. Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal that Trump tore up and even today signals some openness to reviving diplomacy. Tehran maintains that it has “never abandoned the negotiating table” and is willing to discuss alleged military aspects of its civilian nuclear energy program. That should be enough, since, according to U.S. intelligence, Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program, and according to the NPT, it has the right to civilian nuclear energy.\n\nTrump campaigned against Forever Wars. In his inaugural address, he said his legacy would “be that of a peacemaker” and that his success would be measured “by the wars that we end – and perhaps more importantly, the wars we never get into.” According to the Annual Threat Assessment, Iran presents no pressing need to break that promise mere months into Trump’s second administration. The president says he wants to sign a deal with Iran, but so far, his extreme threats seem to be making that diplomatic goal more difficult to achieve.",

        "content": "From the end of the Second World War to the fall of the Berlin Wall, American foreign policy was oriented toward a singular goal: defeating Soviet communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 21st century, however, the greatest threat to core American interests is no longer located on the borders of Europe. Instead, it resides in the Indo-Pacific, where the People’s Republic of China is the United States’ most formidable adversary, both economically and militarily. It has been nearly a decade since Beijing debuted its Made in China 2025 initiative, by which China aims to supersede the United States in nearly every critical industry and sector imaginable. Communist China is our challenge.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have long understood these geopolitical realities. An America-First foreign policy is one based on prioritizing tangible American interests—not empty abstractions. For decades, American leaders have told European leaders what they want to hear, not what they need to hear. The kid-glove treatment is over.\n\nThe foreign adventurism of the last 30 years has not been “conservative” at all. It’s Wilsonian liberalism in new clothes. The Wilsonians—neoconservatives and neoliberals alike—used to dominate both party establishments. They saw the world in terms of abstract “values,” and insisted that those values—rather than concrete, tangible national interests—must direct American foreign policy. In other words, America was compelled to be everywhere, all at once, all the time.\n\nAmerican realism requires tough choices and recognizes scarcity, meaning that we cannot, in fact, be everywhere, all at once, all the time.\n\nAs President John Quincy Adams famously said, “America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe future of American foreign policy is realism. It isn’t a new concept, but has been practiced since the dawn of our very country. Washington and Hamilton backed John Jay’s treaty, which was unpopular at the time but kept the British at bay, affording the United States the ability to rebuild and rearm. The Monroe Doctrine, an oft-cited but non-central part of Monroe’s annual message to Congress in 1823, was cited by Adams and then later by JFK. Franklin D. Roosevelt was perhaps the most cited and notable practitioner of American realism. As the author and historian John Hulsman has explained, Roosevelt’s genius lay in understanding when fighting abroad was truly necessary to protect our own interests, especially when it came to America preserving and defending its freedom against the unchecked tyranny of Nazism.\n\nAmerican realism asks many important questions when considering intervention, investment, or increased interest, but centers on one core question: Are American core strategic interests at stake? It’s critical that we preserve American blood and money for interventions or efforts that either directly benefit American core interests or protect American core interests.\n\nFortunately, this White House understands that America’s resources are finite. The nature of the threats we face today and the revival of American realism demands a more resilient Europe that can defend its own sovereignty in a real, tangible way.\n\nUnfortunately, European countries are in the midst of disastrous deindustrialization at the behest of radical climate protesters, leaving it in a more precarious situation than it was 30 years ago. Energy Secretary Chris Wright put it best in a recent speech:\n\nWe have outsourced far too much manufacturing, and our allies in Europe have gone much further in this destructive direction. I find it sad and a bit ironic that the once mighty steel and petrochemical industries of the United Kingdom have been displaced to Asia, where the same products will be produced with higher greenhouse gas emissions, then loaded on a diesel-powered ship back to the United Kingdom.\n\nSecretary Wright is correct. Shifting priorities means Europe must do more to defend itself. For too long, America has carried an outsized share of the financial burden for Europe’s security, allowing generations of European leaders to take these defense investments for granted, opting to fill the coffers of pension programs and other social welfare boondoggles. Europeans can’t just up defense spending to meet an arbitrary percentage point; they need to actually spend that increased defense budget on lethal weapon systems and ammunition.\n\nUrgency derives from a truth that many in Washington won’t say out loud: The United States’ defense industrial base is weaker and more strained than it has been in decades. We have nearly depleted our industrial capacity to actually produce the weapons and munitions we desperately need to confront the threats of our time.\n\nAs it currently stands, some estimates suggest that the United States would “likely run out of some munitions—such as long-range, precision-guided munitions” in “less than one week” in the event of a major Taiwan Strait conflict with China. The hard truth is that replenishing these systems will take years, not weeks or months. Foreign policy realists like President Trump, Vice President Vance, myself and many others have sounded the alarm about these vulnerabilities for years.\n\nAmerica cannot afford to ignore this reality, and neither should Europe when it comes to their own industrial base. We’ve tailored our defense industries to low-intensity conflicts and counterterrorism at the expense of our own ability to deter a devastating great-power war in the Indo-Pacific. Europe’s overreliance on American guarantees has only accelerated this decline.\n\nThe threats we face demand far greater investment, and we can’t effectively shift our efforts to face this rising threat unless our NATO allies in Europe step up and contribute significantly more money to their own defense. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed this exact sentiment when speaking in Brussels in February: “The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop. But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.”\n\nOur American realism revival puts core national interests first, and complacency is no longer an option. The best time to fix these issues was decades ago. The second-best time is now. The idea that we can be everyone, all at once, all the time is a fiction perpetuated by an outdated foreign policy blob that cares more about lining its members’ own pockets than about defending American interests.\n\nIt is time we recognize that we must make hard choices while rebuilding our industrial base to face the challenges of the future. It is time for Europe to step up. We must prioritize the homeland and the Indo-Pacific, and, when it is time to go, we must fight with overwhelming force and give our men and women in uniform in combat the advantage in conflict. This is the way.",

        "content": "Thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) employees across the country are being dismissed on Tuesday as the Trump administration began implementing its controversial workforce reduction plan, which could ultimately remove 10,000 staff from the department through forced layoffs.\n\nThe job cuts mark the first tangible impact of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s departmental overhaul announced last week, landing just days after Donald Trump moved to strip collective bargaining rights from workers at HHS and other federal agencies.\n\nKennedy’s restructuring goal is meant to dramatically reshape the department that oversees the US’s food supply, monitors disease outbreaks, conducts critical medical research, and administers health insurance for nearly half the country. He has also said he will create a new office – “the administration for a healthy America” – which is meant to absorb agencies controlling billions of dollars in funding that manage addiction services and community health centers.\n\nWhen finished, the cuts are expected to reduce HHS staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 positions – slashing nearly a quarter of its workforce through a combination of layoffs and early retirement offers.\n\nUnion representatives were notified last Thursday that 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated, with positions in human resources, procurement, finance and IT targeted. Jobs in “high cost regions” and those deemed “redundant or duplicative” will be prioritized for elimination, according to a reduction of force email seen by the Guardian.\n\nThe department has outlined specific job losses across a number of agencies, including 3,500 positions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and 300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A professional YouTuber in Queensland has been ordered to pay $350,000 plus interest and costs to the former world record score holder for Donkey Kong, after the Brisbane district court found the YouTuber had defamed him “recklessly” with false claims of a link between a lawsuit and another YouTuber’s suicide.\n\nWilliam “Billy” Mitchell, an American gamer who had held world records in Donkey Kong and Pac-Man going back to 1982, as recognised by the Guinness World Records and the video game database Twin Galaxies, brought the case against Karl Jobst, seeking $400,000 in general damages and $50,000 in aggravated damages.\n\nJobst, who makes videos about “speed running” (finishing games as fast as possible), as well as gaming records and cheating in games, made a number of allegations against Mitchell in a 2021 YouTube video. He accused Mitchell of cheating, and “pursuing unmeritorious litigation” against others who had also accused him of cheating, the court judgment stated.\n\nThe court heard Mitchell was accused in 2017 of cheating in his Donkey Kong world records by using emulation software instead of original arcade hardware. Twin Galaxies investigated the allegation, and subsequently removed Mitchell’s scores and banned him from participating in its competitions.\n\nThe Guinness World Records disqualified Mitchell as a holder of all his records – in both Donkey Kong and Pac-Man – after the Twin Galaxies decision.\n\nThe judgment stated that Jobst’s 2021 video also linked the December 2020 suicide of another YouTuber, Apollo Legend, to “stress arising from [his] settlement” with Mitchell, and wrongly asserted that Apollo Legend had to pay Mitchell “a large sum of money”.\n\nThe judgment noted multiple versions of the video were published, with the allegations removed or addressed, before Jobst issued a retraction video in July 2021, two months after the original. The first video was viewed by more than 500,000 people, including 200,000 in Australia, the court heard.\n\nJudge Ken Barlow found Jobst had made five defamatory imputations about Mitchell, including that Mitchell had required Apollo Legend pay him a large sum of money and thus implying he “in essence, hounded Apollo Legend to death”.\n\nBarlow found this was “based on a fallacy” – and that Jobst, in not making further inquiries before publishing the video, had been “recklessly indifferent” to if it was true.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jobst (middle) leaves the Brisbane district court on Tuesday. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP\n\nJobst denied the imputations had been made in the video. He argued Mitchell had a pre-existing bad reputation because he had been previously exposed as a cheat, the court heard.\n\nBarlow found Mitchell did have an existing reputation as a cheat and for suing people who alleged he was a cheat, and found that Mitchell had expressed joy when he believed – incorrectly – on an earlier occasion that Apollo Legend may have died. But Barlow found Jobst had severely damaged Mitchell’s reputation and caused distress.\n\nHe described Jobst as having a “self-aggrandising and perhaps self-protective tendency not to admit error and not to back down once he has taken a stance”.\n\nBarlow framed Jobst’s actions as a “crusade” against Mitchell, stating that he was trying to “[show] his audience that he is the knight who slew the Mitchell dragon”.\n\nThe judgment summary noted that the court was not called on to decide, and did not decide, if Mitchell had cheated in his world record scores.\n\nThe court awarded Mitchell $300,000 in damages for non-economic loss, and an additional $50,000 in aggravated damages due to Jobst’s publishing the video twice, mocking Mitchell’s complaint about it, failing to apologise and withdraw the allegations, and his “clear malice” towards Mitchell.\n\nJobst was ordered to pay more than $40,000 in interest on the damages from the date of publication, as well as Mitchell’s costs.\n\nMitchell had previously sued Twin Galaxies in the US in a case which settled in January 2024. As part of the settlement, Twin Galaxies published a statement that Mitchell had “produced expert opinion that the game play on the tapes of Mr Mitchell’s record game plays could depict play on an original unmodified Donkey Kong arcade hardware if the hardware involved was malfunctioning, likely due to the degradation of components”.\n\nThe company said it would reinstate all of Mitchell’s previous scores on its website’s official historical database, and remove the dispute thread about Mitchell’s records. Mitchell’s Guinness World Records were also reinstated in June 2020.",

        "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross review – David Mamet’s masterpiece still dazzles on Broadway",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The new revival of David Mamet’s seminal play Glengarry Glen Ross opens on Broadway 41 years and one week after the work’s original Broadway debut, in March 1984. It’s not exactly an auspicious anniversary, yet it’s a close enough parallel to wonder whether this new production is simply the latest modern contextualization of Mamet’s masterpiece, or a belated anniversary gift.\n\nNothing about the play, save perhaps the scale of its two lavish sets at the recently reopened Palace Theatre in Manhattan, has been especially contemporized. It’s still clearly set in the early 80s, unfolding in four scenes: three conversations in a Chinese restaurant in the first act, and one long sequence in a real estate office in the second. The four major characters are salesmen defined principally by their levels of desperation. Shelley “The Machine” Levene (Bob Odenkirk) hits the highest, as an ageing would-be closer on a cold-sweat streak, with a nagging, insistent tendency to remind everyone the precise dates of his long-past wins. Ricky Roma (Kieran Culkin) keeps it coolest, his patter with a potential customer so smooth that he barely mentions a sale until the end of the scene. In the middle (at least of a scale that includes Levene) are the aggrieved Dave Moss (Bill Burr) and the worn-out George Aaronow (Michael McKean), who seems to lack the energy for more active desperation. Everyone is after better “leads” – information on prospective clients who might actually want to buy land, as opposed to the extra-sweaty nudging required to sell it to those who don’t want or can’t afford it. Naturally, they’re only provided to the salesmen who are already proving themselves with sales.\n\nThe 1992 film adaptation opened up a little more, dramatizing some additional scenes only described or alluded to on stage. Most famously, though, it added an introductory scene featuring Alec Baldwin as a higher-up salesman sent down to the office to berate the other men spectacularly in the guise of rallying the troops. This is how it came to be that the most famous lines “from” the play (“Put that coffee down,” “third prize is, you’re fired” and so on) aren’t actually in the play, at least not in the biggest productions. (Some local stage versions have apparently incorporated the movie’s iconic opening, presumably knowing that some portion of the audience will be waiting for it. That, and it’s a terrific piece of writing, and probably a hell of a lot of fun to perform.)\n\nIf it seems a little churlish to bring up a famous film adaptation, that is what a new Broadway Glengarry, directed by Patrick Marber, is competing with, especially in its limited-engagement starriness: a particularly great version of the text, with Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as the leads, that’s been widely available for over 30 years. But that’s also some of the pleasure of a new Glengarry, observing the vast differences between, say, the Pacino Ricky Roma and the Culkin version, tailored to the recent Oscar winner’s strengths. Though well into middle age, Culkin seems young compared to his co-stars, a quality he uses to turn Roma into a blithe faux-oversharer – someone who uses the would-be honesty of the Culkin persona to seem more freewheeling and approachable to clients. (It’s sort of a millennial-hipster read on the character, even if he’s still technically from the silent generation.)\n\nOdenkirk, meanwhile, teases out Levene’s comic anti-timing, his staccato interruptions insisting that office manager John Williamson (Donald Webber Jr) “wait” and hear out his further entreaties, no matter how little they amount to anything. This is a cast heavy with comic experience – Burr seems to juice some extra laughs just by obviously being Bill Burr, still working in his standup-rant rhythms – and the script, bleak as it is, remains very funny. Comic undertones also emerge from the speed of the first act, which at this particular preview was done in about 39 minutes flat; whether the actors just happened to rocket through or intentionally tightened the pace, the effect on the slightly longer, single-location second act was palpable.\n\nThose effects are amplified by Webber as Williamson. Though he’s less famous than some of its co-stars, he’s an unquestionable highlight of the show, especially in his controlled use of silences that throw the other characters off-balance. Williamson becomes a target for much salesman invective, from both Levene and Roma, and casting a Black actor in the role loads those confrontations up even more; he doesn’t always lash back at his furious coworkers, which makes his ultimate decisions cut even sharper. Glengarry Glen Ross may have lost some of its capacity to surprise over the past four decades, but the new revival offers a tribute to its durability. The setting, the lines and the tragedy of normal men attempting to hard-charge their way through decaying capitalism can remain the same, while the actors find new ways to sell it.",

        "content": "US voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday in Wisconsin and Florida in elections that some see as a test of Donald Trump’s popularity and the political clout of his billionaire ally Elon Musk.\n\nThe most closely watched contest is a battle for a seat on Wisconsin’s seven-member supreme court. Conservatives are trying to flip ideological control of the court, which currently has a 4-3 liberal majority. The contest, which features liberal judge Susan Crawford facing off against conservative Brad Schimel, will have huge consequences in the state.\n\nThe supreme court is set to determine the future of abortion and collective bargaining rights. The court could also ultimately require the state legislature to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts, which are heavily distorted in favor of Republicans, who control six of them.\n\nThe race has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $80m spent on both sides. Elon Musk and groups aligned with him have spent more than $20m, and Musk traveled to the state over the weekend to distribute two $1m checks to voters as part of a sweepstakes-like contest. Musk’s investment in the race began shortly after Tesla filed a lawsuit challenging a state law that prevents the company from opening car dealerships in the state. It also comes as he has waged a dangerous attack on judges who block Trump’s executive actions.\n\nTrump endorsed Schimel in March.\n\nAdvertising spending on behalf of Crawford ($42.1m) so far has exceeded that spent on Schimel’s behalf ($33.7m), according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political spending. That much spending is significantly more than the $51m spent on the 2023 state supreme court race and it is orders of magnitude more than was spent in the 2020 race, when candidates spent a combined $10m.\n\nDemocrats have seized on Musk’s entrance into the race and sought to energize voters disturbed by his efforts to gut the federal government and make the race a referendum on Trump’s two and a half months in office.\n\n“The Wisconsin supreme court race is the first major test of Elon Musk’s political power since the November presidential race,” Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic party, said in an interview in March.\n\nIn Florida, much of the attention will be on a special election to replace Mike Waltz, who resigned from Congress to serve as Trump’s national security adviser. Waltz easily won re-election last year in the sixth congressional district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 33 points in November. But there are now concerns that the race may be more competitive than expected.\n\nThe Democratic candidate in the race, Josh Weil, has brought in more than $10m while his opponent, Republican Randy Fine, still favored to win, has brought in around $1m. Weil has also campaigned by emphasizing the threats Musk poses to Medicare and social security.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fine is still favored to win the race, but if Weil comes within a closer than expected margin, it could still be a sign of momentum for Democrats.\n\nIf Democrats were able to flip the seat, it would have significant reverberations in the US House.

The concern was so prominent that Trump last week pulled the nomination of Elise Stefanik to be his ambassador to the UN so Republicans could preserve their margin.\n\nThe other special election on Tuesday is a contest in the Florida panhandle to fill the seat once held by Matt Gaetz, who resigned when Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general and then later withdrew his nomination. Republican Jimmy Patronis is expected to win the seat.",

        "content": "Rightwing groups around the US are pushing legislation that would place new limits on what books are allowed in school libraries in a move that critics decry as censorship often focused on LGBTQ+ issues or race or imposing conservative social values.\n\nCaught up in the attempts at suppressing books are classics like The Color Purple and Slaughterhouse Five.\n\nOpponents of such bills argue that they would actually hinder individual rights because the proponents would be imposing their beliefs on parents and children who do not share their views. Those campaigning for the restrictions say it would prevent children from being exposed to what they label sexually explicit and obscene content and increase parental rights.\n\nThere are at least 112 proposed state bills concerning school – and public – libraries that seek to expand the definition of what is deemed obscene or “harmful to minors” and to limit librarian staff’s ability to determine which books are in their collections, according to the American Library Association.\n\nJudges have already declared some recent laws that banned books unconstitutional and if approved, the other legislation would probably face court challenges.\n\nThe battle over school libraries represents another front in the culture war over how American society deals with race, sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“Parents want to be able to have a certain way of making sure that inappropriate, sexually explicit books aren’t being put in school libraries, and if they ever find these books in the school library, that they can easily and smoothly remove those books,” said Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of government relations for Texas Values, a conservative advocacy group that has tried to ban books that they describe as pornography and has pushed for creationism to be taught alongside evolution.\n\nWhile there have always been efforts to censor books, there has been a surge in recent years in legislation that concerns material in libraries. In 2014, there were 183 titles targeted for removal from public and school libraries; in 2023, there were 4,240, according to the American Library Association (ALA), which also states that it is not a complete list.\n\n“There has been a coordinated effort by” groups like Moms for Liberty that “because of their personal, political, moral or religious beliefs don’t want young people to be reading certain books, and they want the publicly-funded schools and publicly funded libraries to reflect their views”, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the library association’s office for intellectual freedom.\n\nIn Texas, there are at least 31 bills – the most of any state – that would impair libraries ability to “acquire and provide diverse materials, resources and programming”, according to the library association. During the 2023-24 school year, there were 538 book bans in Texas, which trailed only Florida and Iowa, according to PEN America, a group dedicated to promoting free expression.\n\nTexas state lawmakers are now considering senate bill 13, which would require that local school boards – rather than librarians – approve all books added or removed from school libraries.\n\nThey would have to establish a local advisory council, comprised mostly of parents or students in the district, that would recommend which books should be in the school catalog. And they would not be allowed to have “indecent” or “profane” content, including books with “grossly offensive language”.\n\nChristin Bentley, a member of the state Republican executive committee who chairs a subcommittee, stop sexualizing Texas kids, has advocated for the senate bill because she is concerned about “sexually explicit [books] and books that tell kids to go look at porn online”, she said.\n\n“It’s sexually grooming children,” said Bentley, a mother of two who lives near Tyler in the north-eastern part of the state.\n\nTexas districts have also banned books such as Beloved and The Handmaid’s Tale, along with newer novels like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and The Underground Railroad, according to the Dallas Observer.\n\nBentley said she was most concerned about books like Blue Is the Warmest Color and A Game of Thrones graphic novel because of their sexually explicit content.\n\n“A lot of the books that are sexually explicit or very indecent and profane, they are part of a genre called young adult, and that’s relatively new,” Bentley said.\n\nWhile supporters of such legislation argue that parents need greater control over what their children are exposed to in schools, librarians already welcome parent input, according to Lucy Podmore, a librarian and former chair of the Texas Association of School Librarians.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Carolyn Foote, a retired librarian in Texas, said there are towns throughout the state that do not have a bookstore or public library.\n\n“Sometimes the school library is just the center for academic pursuits,” said Foote, who along with other librarians founded a group, Texas FReadom Fighters. “Also, it assumes a certain amount of privilege that everyone has money and can just go to the bookstore.”\n\nFoote spent 29 years as a librarian and said she has experienced other “waves of censorship”, but she said the scale of those did not compare to the last few years.\n\nThe Texas senate passed the bill on 19 March, and it now goes before the state house.\n\nPart of the bill could violate the first amendment’s right to freedom of speech and expression, according to Catherine Ross, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University.\n\nDetermining what books are “harmful” is “incredibly subjective, and it would potentially sweep in much too much material that is protected, even for students in grades K through 12”, Ross said.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, librarians would also have a harder time adding books, and it would require a significant time commitment from volunteers who serve on the advisory committee to review all new books, Podmore said.\n\nBut banning books because some parents think they are obscene means that other students can no longer access them in schools.\n\n“If you don’t want your child to read a book, they don’t have to read it, but you’re not allowed to tell every child in my campus that they can’t read this book because you don’t believe in it,” said Margarita Longoria, a Texas school librarian.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The court ruling barring Marine Le Pen from running for president has recast a spotlight on her right-hand man, Jordan Bardella, as debate swirls over who may end up representing the far right in France’s 2027 presidential race.\n\nWhile Le Pen’s lawyer has said she will appeal Monday’s court ruling, the process could drag on for months or years, leaving the ban firmly in place as the country heads towards presidential elections. Polls had long suggested that Le Pen, who helms the far-right the National Rally (RN) party, was among the leading contenders to succeed the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, after his second and final term ends in 2027.\n\nIf Le Pen cannot run, most have pointed to Bardella, her 29-year-old protege who succeeded her at the helm of the party in 2021, as the most probable presidential candidate. At times cast as too young and inexperienced, Bardella has, however, seemingly had the backing of his boss. “Of course he has the capacity to become president of the republic,” Le Pen said in a documentary broadcast by BFMTV late on Sunday.\n\nSuch a move would nonetheless mark a dramatic new era for France and – far-right politics aside – may seem unthinkable for many voters. When Macron was elected president in 2017, he was 39 years old, which made him the youngest president in the history of the Fifth Republic. Before his election, the average age at which a French president was elected was 58.5 years.\n\nFirst elected to the European parliament at the age of 23, Bardella became the new face of the French far right last year after he led the RN’s European election campaign to unprecedented heights.\n\nHe then went on to lead the RN during France’s snap parliamentary elections, yielding a third-place finish despite polls that suggested the party would come first. (RN garnered most votes in the first round but was relegated by an alliance on the left voting tactically in the second round.) “We always make mistakes, I made mistakes, and I take my share of responsibility for the results,” Bardella told French television soon after the results came in.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jordan Bardella (right) and RN member and EU lawmaker Fabrice Leggeri inside a bomb shelter with an Israeli army officer, Ethan Dana, during a visit to Netiv Haasara kibbutz in southern Israel. Photograph: Jack Guez/Reuters\n\nThe son of Italians who arrived in France in the 1960s, Bardella joined the far-right party at the age of 16. He embodied a striking contrast to Le Pen. Growing up on a housing estate in Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb, he was raised by a single mother who he said often had just €20 left in her purse at the end of the month.\n\nSmooth-talking and clad in navy suits, Bardella soon proved himself adept at sticking closely to the party’s hardline stance, leveraging his massive following on French TikTok to attempt to normalise the RN’s vehemence against immigrants, and Muslims in particular. Earlier this month, he became the first RN party leader to visit Israel, speaking at a conference on the fight against antisemitism.\n\nLast year, after two years spent analysing Bardella’s speeches, one academic described them as being “copy-pasted” from Le Pen and her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a founder of the party launched in the 1970s as the National Front and who was known for making antisemitic, racist remarks.\n\n“It’s still the same triad of immigration, identity and Islam. The big difference is tone and style,” Cécile Alduy, a professor at Stanford University, said. “The message is the same but delivered in a really smooth, poised and calm tone of voice.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In what was seen by many at the time as a swipe at Le Pen – and which led one leftwing politician to call him “Brutus” after the Roman politician who assassinated his ex-ally Julius Caesar – Bardella told BFMTV that “not having a criminal record is, for me, rule number one when you want to be an MP”.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "When Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News, informed her staff recently that she was shaking up how they worked as part of a drive to combat “the growing trend of news avoidance”, she had in mind the likes of Dave Ayres, a handyman from Leeds.\n\n“I used to have the news on the TV every morning for an hour or so as I got the children ready for school and completed my household tasks,” he said. “Now it has literally been switched off and unplugged. I can’t cope with it any more. It’s just too much and there’s nothing I can do about it.”\n\nThough he dips into his favourite news apps occasionally in the evening, he now strictly limits his news consumption. He’s not alone. The Guardian has been contacted by a series of one-time news junkies who are now seeking to restrict their news intake after suffering from disturbed sleep or a downturn in their mood.\n\nA related concern is affecting the sleep of Caroline Waterston, the Daily Mirror’s editor-in-chief. “The biggest challenge right now that’s keeping me awake is the under-35 audience,” she said this week, adding that if news companies can figure out how to reach them, they could also offer a big opportunity.\n\nAcross newsrooms around the world, strategies are being launched to reach news avoiders, a cohort of refusniks behind a long-term decline in news engagement. The proportion of people who say they selectively avoid the news to some degree increased three percentage points last year to 39%, according to a survey across 17 countries by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Since 2017, it has increased by 10 percentage points.\n\nOver the last decade, the number of people getting any news online, whether through a news website or on social media, fell across every age group. In fact, the news avoiders break down into three groups. The first is a growing group of former news consumers who are dialling back, the second is a group who have never engaged with news in the first place, while the third group worrying media executives is young people, who appear to have lost trust in established news brands.\n\nThe problem has been accelerated by changes to social media algorithms and search engines that mean fewer people are finding their way to news sites. “The perception is definitely that it’s getting worse,” said Benjamin Toff, the director of the Minnesota Journalism Center and the co-author of Avoiding the News. “Part of that perception is based on the digital analytics data that many of these organisations are looking at.\n\n“On the audience side, there is a degree of fatigue and exhaustion. A lot of people just feel, for their own mental health, they want to curtail the amount of news they’re paying attention to. Meanwhile, younger people who are using Instagram and TikTok, where the ability to include links to content outside of those platforms is a major challenge, are probably contributing to the decrease in [news site] traffic.”\n\nThe response in newsrooms has been varied, but there are a few clear trends. To deal with the boom in content and declining free time, curation is king. Newsletters with a few handpicked stories, podcasts delving into a single subject and a reduction in story counts have already emerged as early winners from the news avoider war. Personalisation is the next frontier, with some newsrooms already using newsletters personalised using AI.\n\n“If the personalisation algorithm takes into account personal interest and what’s trending now in a relevant way, you can increase retention by double-digit numbers,” said Danny Lein, the founder of the Twipe tech company, which pioneered personalised newsletters at the Times. The firm has since rolled it out across seven international newsrooms. “Finding that good mix is really key. If it’s only based on personal interest, you get echo chambers.”\n\nTurness believes personalisation is part of the answer at the BBC. The corporation has a lot of personal data that could help it tailor products, but it also has strict rules on the use of AI and has not yet been clear on its plans. There are also dangers. “We tend to find that people aren’t so keen,” said Craig T Robertson from the Reuters Institute. “If you’re personalising a news feed or news homepage, there’s a sense that they’re missing out on other things. It’s not like music or movies.”\n\nThen there’s the problem of negativity and a sense of powerlessness – another theme that emerged among news avoiders contacted by the Guardian. “We need to feel uplifted, encouraged and hopeful, not oppressed and afraid,” said one. After discovering that a third of those ditching their subscriptions complained of news fatigue, executives at Spain’s eldiario.es started looking at a new product that concentrated on the best news of the month, or stories with a constructive angle. Dagens Nyheter in Sweden is another outlet consciously including more positive pieces even on difficult topics.\n\nThe “constructive journalism” movement, which began in Denmark and encourages more stories on progress and problem solving, is gaining ground. Oliver Duff, the editor of the i Paper, said this week that it was often seen as a “dirty word in newsrooms”, but said it needed to be taken seriously because “our audience disagrees”.\n\nAs for winning over Gen Z, many are concluding that overcoming their different habits and lack of trust requires a radical reimagining of what newsrooms do. In Scandinavia, publishers such as Schibsted are spending more time explaining their editorial decisions. Duff also said there was a need to “pull back the curtain” on the editorial process. “You’re explaining exactly why this author or this creator has got expertise on this story, or why Katie spoke to 18 sources in Whitehall to tell this story that’s never been told,” he said.\n\nLikewise, Reach, which owns the Daily Mirror, is planning to use new studios to reach a younger audience with video – and some of their journalists are being encouraged to be more like influencers. Waterston said a journalist at a prominent court case was encouraged to talk about “what it felt like for them sitting in the court. We should lean into that.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In its brief moment of fame, the torpedo bat has made quite the impression in MLB. Over the weekend, the New York Yankees used the bat, designed by an MIT-educated professor, as an instrument of destruction against the hapless Milwaukee Brewers. Since then, I’ve heard about the bats so often that they’ve been showing up in my dreams. And that makes sense, because prior to this weekend, even in a bandbox like Yankee Stadium, even for a franchise that’s featured the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle, such home run power could only have been cooked up in the sweetest slumbers of their fanbase. Such a display of muscle was less video game and more cartoon, as in the famed 1946 Bugs Bunny clip that saw the Gas-House Gorillas rack up 46 straight runs against the genteel Tea Totallers.\n\nThe scene at Yankee Stadium over the weekend.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Yankees, minus the 68 home runs of the now departed Juan Soto and the injured Giancarlo Stanton, provided a franchise record nine home runs in one game, 15 home runs across three games and 36 total runs against the Brewers. We’re talking about a Yankees team that coughed up five errors on Saturday and still won by 11 runs.\n\nThe torpedo bats, just about the only thing that could overshadow MLB’s botching of Opening Day thanks to the crashing of its own app, is another example of how over-innovation can ruin baseball. The engineers who came up with the bat are cousins of the stats savants who brought us the analytics which slowly sucked the entertainment out of the sport, and the physics experts who came up with scientifically altered pitchers which sank the 2024 batting averages of all but six teams to below .250.\n\nThe latest over-innovation moves the bulk of the wood in the bat to the customized area where the batter is most likely to hit the ball the hardest. The enlarged sweetspot, which gives a player a better chance of making good contact makes perfect sense, and frankly, it’s incredibly smart. And yes, hitters do need something, anything, to take back some of the game from the pitchers who have shrunk batting averages for years. Now they have.\n\nThat said, 15 home runs in three games? That’s a problem. After the Yankees’ 12-3 win over the Brewers on Sunday, their radio voice Suzyn Waldman was trying to explain away the torpedo issue, by saying that it’s not new, that the exit velocity is similar between traditional and torpedo bats, that other teams use them and that the issue will be a talking point for a while until everyone moves on.\n\nThat’s partially true: other players around the league are toying with the bats, and it’s not entirely new. But New York, thanks to the 2022 hiring of the bat’s key brain, Aaron Leanhardt, who holds a postgraduate degree in physics from MIT, are seemingly more in on the torpedo bats than any other team. If New York – or any other teams who decide to adopt the bat – continue to hit like this over the long-term it will turn box scores into farces, and mess with the integrity of the game in a way we haven’t seen since the steroid era.\n\nIt should be said that some players and coaches from other teams don’t seem to have an issue with the new bats. “It’s still a human that has to hit it,” said Cleveland Guardians manager Stephen Vogt. “It’s not the bat hitting the homer.”\n\nSwap “bat” for “PEDs”, and that’s a common defense for Barry Bonds’ election into the Hall of Fame. In this case, an important distinction is that the bats are totally legal, the Yankees have not broken any rules of the game. Coincidentally, Bonds’ early adoption of maple bats was, to a way lesser degree, somewhat controversial.\n\nView image in fullscreen Barry Bonds and torpedo bats have something in common. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP\n\nThe reason he began using maple, and PEDs, is the same reason the torpedo bat is in the news today – players and teams are continuously looking for an edge. And right now the Yankees are getting it.\n\nNow that we’re here, I have several questions. Will New York’s torrid stretch continue? Will this tech be adopted by other teams and players? If that happens, will more games become farcical? And should the bats be banned? If torpedo bats are banned – and there’s no indication that one is forthcoming – then why didn’t the Yankees wait until the playoffs to unveil their secret weapon? Now that would have surely wrestled back their “evil empire” label from the Dodgers.\n\nThere’s a caveat here. Aaron Judge smoked the Brewers – one of his four homers in the series went 468ft – without the torpedo bat. And then, on Monday, the Royals crushed the Brewers 11-1. As far as we know, the Royals don’t have torpedo bats, leading us to the conclusion that rather than being victims of technology, the Brewers are just … bad. But if the Yankees’ power-surge continues for another two weeks or so, MLB will probably have no choice but to ban the bats, legal or not, under the little used “best interests in baseball” clause. This would be another embarrassing mess for baseball, as Leanhardt told the Athletic that “it was a group effort, the results coming from conversations with coaches, players, MLB and bat makers.” So unless we’re all overreacting, MLB may have botched the rollout of this new tech by not unilaterally taking over the usage from the clubs.\n\nThe good news is that dialed down torpedo bats could actually serve as the long-term answer for suffering hitters. This could be vital for a sport which needs more dynamic offense and less of the increasingly predictable and boring three outcomes: a walk, strikeout or a home run. For now, much to the chagrin of Yankees fans, I’d put the toy back in the box, do the research and development in the minor leagues, and reintroduce a more refined product in a few seasons.",

The threats to America’s democracy are grave and urgent.”\n\nBooker’s speech is not technically a filibuster as he is not trying to run down the Senate’s time to prevent a piece of legislation from passing.\n\nInstead, he has used his speaking slot to decry the Trump administration’s spending cuts, its attempt to abolish the Department of Education, the president’s attempts to bypass the judicial system and the removal of people from the US who speak out against the administration.\n\nBooker’s speech has been supported with reams of quotes from speeches by the late American politicians John McCain and John Lewis, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles.\n\nSome of the senator’s fellow Democrats have helped support him during his monologues, with several asking questions that have allowed Booker to have a break without yielding the floor.\n\nThe Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, was the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his “strength and conviction”.\n\n“You’re taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,” Schumer said in his own question to Booker.\n\n“Just give us a little inkling of the strength – give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.”\n\nAt one point, Booker spoke about the need for bipartisanship and mentioned a recent dinner he had with Ted Cruz, the arch-conservative Republican senator from Texas. Cruz is no stranger to marathon speeches, having spoken for more than 21 hours in 2013 in an attempt to filibuster an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. At one point, Cruz read from Green Eggs and Ham, the Dr Seuss children’s book.\n\nBooker has a long way to go to beat the all-time Senate record, however. In 1957, Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of the same year.",

        "content": "I have been with my husband for 10 years and have previously never so much as looked in the direction of another man. We had a regular sex life but when an old school friend got back in touch, we began messaging each other and it quickly turned into sexting. The nudes and explicit, erotic messages I sent were completely out of character for me. We discussed plans to meet up for one night of selfish, illicit fun – free of spouses, children and responsibilities – but when I asked for clarity on where I stood, he said that we shouldn’t message any more. I was heartbroken. Now I don’t want to have sex with my husband because it is not exciting enough. What can I do to get my marriage back on track?\n\nVirtual sex can be risky and painful, and this experience has been very challenging for you. When sexting, it is important to remember that it belongs in the fantasy realm. There is never any guarantee that there will be a “real” aspect, and it is best not to assume that there is any meaningful relationship whatsoever. But your desire to have exciting sex of some kind is understandable. Perhaps you need to let your husband know that. You may have the best results if you present some options. First, imagine and fantasise about what would be thrilling for you to enjoy with your husband, then find a relaxed moment to broach the subject and see if he might be receptive to it, and if there is something special that would turn him on. Our partners are not responsible for our pleasure – we are. We have to create our own erotic universes, whether in private fantasy or in reality. True intimacy, and the opportunity for great eroticism, occurs when both people can share those universes.\n\nPamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Well Actually Free weekly newsletter Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In the end, whatever Elon Musk and Donald Trump liked to insist, astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita Williams were never stuck, nor stranded in space, and definitely not abandoned or marooned.\n\nThe world heard on Monday, for the first time since their return to Earth two weeks ago, from the two Nasa astronauts whose 10-day flight to the international space station (ISS) last summer turned into a nine-month odyssey. And their story was markedly at odds with the narrative painted from the White House.\n\nWilmore and Williams were speaking to reporters at a press conference in Houston, hours after a joint appearance on Fox News, and reaffirmed that they never felt neglected or in need of the rescue the president insisted was necessary.\n\nInstead, they said, they calmly assumed duties as members of the space station crew – “planning for one thing, preparing for another”, Wilmore said – while a political firestorm over their status raged back on the ground.\n\nIf anything, the pair of veteran space flyers appeared slightly bemused by, or largely ignorant of the furore that followed their enforced and protracted stay on the orbiting outpost 250 miles above Earth, caused by technical failures on board their pioneering Boeing Starliner spacecraft that returned in September without them.\n\nAt the press conference Nasa had called to discuss the science activities the astronauts performed during their time in space, Williams and Wilmore gave diplomatic answers to questions designed to elicit their thoughts.\n\n“The stuck and marooned narrative … yes, we heard about that,” Wilmore said, before reverting to a carefully worded explanation of how their training and preparations allowed them to pivot seamlessly from the roles of new spacecraft test pilots to routine ISS crew members who splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on 18 March on a routine crew rotation flight.\n\n“The plan went way off for what we had planned. But because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies. This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go,” he continued.\n\nEarlier, in the Fox interview, he pushed back on Musk’s false claim, amplified by Trump, that the astronauts were “abandoned in space by the Biden administration”. Had they felt stuck, stranded or marooned, the interviewer, Bill Hemmer, wondered.\n\n“Any of those adjectives, they’re very broad in their definition,” Wilmore said.\n\n“So in certain respects we were stuck, in certain respects, maybe we were stranded, but based on how they were couching this, that we were left and forgotten in orbit, we were nowhere near any of that at all.\n\n“Stuck? OK, we didn’t get to come home the way we planned. But in the big scheme of things, we weren’t stuck. We planned and trained. Let me comment back on this other [claim], you know, ‘They failed you’. Who? Who’s they?”\n\nWilliams, too, was reluctant to kick the political football. In orbit, she said, her focus was solely on the work she needed to do.\n\n“You sort of get maybe a little bit tunnel-visioned … you do your job type of thing, right, and so you’re not really aware of what else is going on down there,” she said.\n\n“I hate to say that maybe the world doesn’t revolve around us, but we revolve around the world, something like that. But I think we were just really focused on what we were doing and trying to be part of the team. Of course, we heard some things … ”\n\nThe third US astronaut at the press conference, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, who returned to Earth with Williams and Wilmore, backed up his crewmate.\n\n“The politics, kind of, they don’t make it up there when we’re trying to make operational decisions,” he said. “As the commander [I’m] responsible for the safety of this crew and getting them back safely.”\n\nMusk, the founder of SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor, has continued to push the story, with no evidence, that the astronauts were effectively held hostage in space by Biden for political advantage. It was a SpaceX Dragon capsule that eventually brought them back to Earth, but it was a spacecraft that had been attached to the ISS for months, not one Trump said he directed Musk to “go get the two brave astronauts”.\n\nThe billionaire became embroiled in a heated online dispute with Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen over the claims, and later attacked Mark and Scott Kelly, both retired astronauts and the former now Democratic senator for Arizona, for calling him out.\n\nAs for the troubled Starliner, whose future is questionable as Boeing and Nasa engineers continue to evaluate the helium leaks and thruster control issues that brought its maiden crewed mission to a premature end, both Williams and Wilmore said they would be happy to fly on it again.\n\nWilmore, as the Starliner mission commander, said there were questions he wished he’d asked during the flight that he believed might have brought a different outcome, and “some shortcomings in tests, shortcomings in preparation, that we did not foresee”. The astronauts will meet Boeing leadership on Wednesday to give first-hand testimony.\n\nThe whole experience, he said, was a learning curve familiar to those in “the difficult job we all take part in”.\n\n“Could you point fingers? I don’t want to point fingers. I hope nobody wants to point fingers. We don’t want to look back and say, ‘shame, shame, shame’. We want to look forward and say, ‘Let’s make the future even more productive and better’.\n\n“That’s the way that I look at it. And what I think the way the nation should look at.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Straight faces, please, as we try to look charitably at the toxic row engulfing Prince Harry’s charity. Are you up to speed with this everyday story of giving folk? I’m in such a muddle with it all that I can’t remember if I’m allowed to say that purely from my observations of her telly interviews, Sentebale chair Sophie Chandauka does seem like a right old loose cannon.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s do a quick recap. Sentebale is a charity to help children and young people with HIV and Aids in Lesotho and Botswana, and was set up almost two decades ago by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, in honour of their mothers. Its current chair is Chandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, and something about her stewardship of the charity has provoked its entire board of trustees to judge that their relationship has broken down irretrievably. Accordingly, they have all resigned. Chandauka in turn has said that the charity was riddled with “poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny [and] misogynoir”, and accused Prince Harry of “harassment and bullying at scale”.\n\nOh dear. As I say, she does seem like quite hard work. Poor Prince Harry. It must be difficult having something you’ve served as a custodian of for a long time, only for some publicity-incontinent member of it to go on a full-spectrum media rampage, airing a load of dirty linen, but leaving you feeling like you have to bite your tongue because you can’t really win against the specific types of identity-based accusations they’re making against you. In fact, saying anything at all will probably just make it all worse and ensure it goes on for much longer. At present, Prince Harry has kept a stiff upper lip and declined to complain or explain, but it’s possible that at some point he’s going to have to offer a concisely delphic statement in an attempt to draw a line under the whole business. Impossible to pluck the perfect phrase out of the air, of course, but I’d go with something like “recollections may vary”.\n\nAnd in case that wasn’t clear, in the interests not of balance, but of accuracy, we do have to state that Prince Harry seems like quite hard work, too. Likewise, his wife.\n\nMeanwhile, it goes without saying that despite its brevity, the above paragraph will serve as the twat-signal to the so-called “Sussex Squad”, a hilarious cavalcade of single-issue human beings who patrol the internet round the clock, policing any and all criticism of the Montecito millionaire couple who ironically need expensive security in part to deal with nutjob fans like them. I mean, I’m paraphrasing, but only vaguely. The Squad also does a lot of other valuable work, like explaining that laughing at Meghan’s ridiculous Netflix lifestyle show is racist.\n\nAnyway, because of all this, I did wonder how they would readjust themselves to the Sentebale blow-up, given that at its heart is a black woman making accusations of bullying and racism. Inevitably – and indeed amusingly – there has been a new bending of reality. Humans, particularly single-issue ones, really are so incredibly resourceful, and I’m hugely enjoying the Sussex Squad’s latest mad conspiracy theory: that Sentabale’s newest trustee, Iain Rawlinson, is someone who, between 10 and 20 years ago, served as chair of Prince William’s conservation charity, and consequently CAN ONLY BE a formal plant by Harry’s brother.\n\nThe theory suggests that Rawlinson is deliberately sabotaging Sentebale and the Sussexes on the orders of the Prince of Wales. (Do I have to even run the denial here? To be clear: I imagine both Iain and the Prince of Wales would rubbish these claims.) Still, it’s some more yarn to pin up across the Squad’s investigation wall, which already resembles one of those webs spun by a spider which has ingested considerable quantities of LSD. (Again, in the interests of running comprehensive denials, I imagine the spider would rubbish that claim, and insist it had taken nothing stronger than a fly.)\n\nAs for the allegations buzzing around between the Chandauka and Sussex camps, they are becoming more gothically petty by the day, and you’d expect we haven’t heard the last of them yet. They include, but are by no means limited to: Harry writes high-handed emails; Sophie has done a predictable publicity stunt; Meghan made Sentabale lose a good price on a venue for a polo game; Meghan spent too much time talking to her friend Serena Williams at the polo game; Sophie wouldn’t publicly defend Meghan after some impenetrable hokey-cokey about where people were standing on a stage when the trophy for the polo game was handed out.\n\nAnd on it goes. It does seem absolutely mad that there is a charity to help some of the world’s poorest children living with the blight of life-threatening disease, when the true victims in all of this seem to be very senior professional or royal people who simply can’t work with each other without explosive fallouts and worldwide publicity tours. Could there not be a much more worthwhile charity set up to help all these people in positions of power and influence when things go wrong at work, instead of children who – let’s face it – aren’t subject to anything like the same pressures? Call it Sentanexplosiveinterview, and I’m sure the donations would flood right on in.\n\nMarina Hyde is a Guardian columnist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Photograph: Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nLiu, who said she was already in New York when she received the call, told CTV News that she was told that the slides about Gaza “could be perceived as antisemitic” and that the USAID slides might be perceived as “anti-governmental”.\n\nLiu said she offered to make edits, but that three hours later the university apologized and said they had to cancel her presentation, leaving her “stunned”.\n\nNYU Langone Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson told CTV News that “guest speakers at our institution are given clear guidelines at the outset.”\n\n“Per our policy we cannot host speakers who don’t comply,” the spokesperson said, adding: “In this case we did fully compensate this guest for her travel and time.”\n\nLiu told CTV News that she believes the cancellation of her presentation reflects the “climate of fear” that US universities are currently living under, where they pre-emptively “self-censor” to avoid retaliation.\n\n“Academia feels vulnerable nowadays and what happened in Columbia University, and the fact that there’s threats of losing some funding,” she said on Thursday.\n\nEarlier this month Columbia University, which has been targeted by the Trump administration over pro-Palestinian protests on its campus last year, gave in to pressure from the White House and agreed to a series of changes in order to restore $400m in federal funding the government pulled after citing allegations that the school failed to protect students from antisemitic harassment.\n\nLast week the school’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, announced that she was stepping down.\n\nIn an opinion article published on Thursday in Le Devoir, Liu wrote that US universities are now “in the crosshairs of presidential cuts”.\n\n“I have sympathy for those who feel insecure on campus,” she wrote. “And I have just as much sympathy for the university managers who are trying to preserve their funding and, ultimately, their jobs, their research and their teaching.”",

He repeated earlier attack lines expressed by Le Pen (11.58), attacking “tyrant judges” and saying the party “will not let you steal the presidential election,” asking “what is Marine Le Pen accused of, it not of being able to defeat this system?” Responding on behalf of the government, justice minister Gérald Darmanin said that Le Pen could appeal against the ruling if she disagrees with it, and said he “personally hoped” that it would be organised “within the most reasonable time possible,” although he stressed that the court is independent of the government in deciding its timelines. Le Pen’s lawyer already confirmed plans to bring an appeal. But under the French laws, it would not result in an interim suspension the application of the immediate public office ban, risking prolonged uncertainty about her eligibility to stand in the 2027 race until the appeal is decided.

He asked prime minister François Bayrou to express “unconditional support” for judges, despite “attacks against our rule of law made from the Kremlin to the White House by the friends of Le Pen.” In response, Bayrou said it would not be right for a government official to ever criticise a court decision as he declared his “unconditional, unmeasured” support for the independent judiciary.

He appeared to say it was the lawmakers’ job to reform the rules on public office bans if they wished to – as suggested by Éric Ciotti – instead of criticising the judges who framed their verdict based on the existing law. He said that, given the separation of powers, “the process is very simple” as a bill would then be examined by both chambers, and “it is parliament that will decide whether or not it is appropriate to change the wording of the law” on which the decision was based.

View image in fullscreen Finnish prime minister Petteri Orpo, pictured with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Helsinki, Finland earlier this month. Photograph: Antti Aimo-Koivisto/Reuters The government said that the change was necessary because of the long-term threat that Russia poses to Europe. Orpo said that while there was no “immediate” military threat, “withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” or – to put in plain English – to stockpile and potentially use landmines on Finland’s 1,340 km long border with Russia. The decision was taken after some “preparatory work” by Finnish officials, who concluded that mines “are well-suited for Finland’s national defence,” as they are “are technically simple and are therefore well suited for training and use in a conscription system,” the government said. It added that landmines “can also be produced quickly and in large quantities in Finland.” The note stressed that the Finnish forces would not deploy mines “in normal conditions,” and the country “remained committed to its international obligations concerning the responsible use of mines,” but it was part of a broader preparation for “what if”. A formal proposal to withdraw from the convention will be prepared in the near future, and the exit will take legal effect six months after the notice is made to the UN secretary general.

        "content": "The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has railed against a Paris court’s “political decision” to bar her from competing for the presidency in 2027, attacking the move to ban her from running for public office as “a denial of democracy”.\n\nIn a day of high political drama, Le Pen was found guilty of embezzlement of European parliament funds on a vast scale, a conviction for which she was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two of those years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet. She was also ordered to pay a €100,000 (£84,000) fine.\n\nA furious Le Pen announced she would lodge an appeal against the ruling, as nationalist and populist figures from around the world rushed to support her.\n\nDonald Trump said the conviction was a “very big deal”.\n\n“I know all about it, and a lot of people thought she wasn’t going to be convicted of anything,” the US president told reporters at the White House. “But she was banned for running for five years, and she’s the leading candidate. That sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to legal cases that Trump himself faced before he took office.\n\nElon Musk, Tesla’s billionaire owner, who has backed the far right in Germany and plays a major role in Trump’s administration, said the sentence against Le Pen would “backfire, like the legal attacks against president Trump”.\n\nThe judges’ decision, backed by more than 150 pages of legal justifications after a nine-week trial, was necessary because nobody was entitled to “immunity in violation of the rule of law”, the head judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis,​ said.\n\nIt was nonetheless considered a political earthquake in France as Le Pen had hoped to mount a fourth campaign to become president for her anti-immigration National Rally (RN) party.\n\nSpeaking for the first time in public about the verdict, Le Pen told TF1 television on Monday night that she would “pursue whatever legal avenues” she could to prevent herself from being “eliminated”. “I’m not going to submit to a denial of democracy this easily,” she said.\n\nLe Pen, who was not found to have benefited personally from the embezzlement, insisted she had done nothing wrong. “I am going to appeal because I am innocent,” she said.\n\n“I’m not going to let myself be eliminated like this. I’m going to pursue whatever legal avenues I can,” she added.\n\nThe RN, the single largest party in the French parliament, called the sentence a travesty.\n\nThe president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, 29, who could be considered a replacement presidential candidate despite his relative inexperience, said: “Today it is not only Marine Le Pen who was unjustly condemned: French democracy was killed.”\n\nHe urged party supporters to “mobilise” peacefully to show “that the will of the people is stronger”, starting a petition in support of Le Pen and a leafleting campaign across the country to take place this weekend.\n\nThe ban on running for public office, to last five years, was ordered to kick in with immediate effect, meaning it will apply even though Le Pen, 56, is appealing against the verdict.\n\nNeither the prison penalty nor fine will be applied until her appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.\n\nIn the front row of the court, Le Pen showed no immediate reaction when the judge declared her guilty. But she grew more agitated and shook her head in disagreement as the judge said her party had illegally used European funds for its own benefit.\n\nAt one point, Le Pen whispered: “Incredible.” She then abruptly left without warning, before her sentence had been handed down.\n\nBefore Monday’s ruling, she had considered the 2027 presidential race as her best chance to gain more ground on an anti-immigration platform, while her opponents attacked her party’s policy platform as racist, xenophobic and anti-Islam.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Socialist president, François Hollande, said the judge’s decision was “based on law” for “serious” allegations. But Laurent Wauquiez, of the traditional right Les Républicains party, said it was a “very heavy and exceptional sentence” that was “not very healthy in democracy”.\n\nMathieu Lefèvre, a member of parliament for Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party, told BFMTV: “Marine Le Pen isn’t the victim of a political or judicial conspiracy. She’s perhaps first the victim of herself and a system of embezzlement.”\n\nLe Pen and 24 party members, including nine former members of the European parliament and their 12 parliamentary assistants, were found guilty of a vast scheme over many years to embezzle European parliament funds, by using money earmarked for European parliament assistants to instead pay party workers in France.\n\nThe so-called fake jobs system covered parliamentary assistant contracts between 2004 and 2016, and was unprecedented in scale and duration, causing losses of €4.5m (£3.8m) to European taxpayer funds. Assistants paid by the European parliament must work directly on Strasbourg parliamentary matters, which the judges found had not been the case.\n\nLe Pen will be able to retain her current post as a member of the French parliament for Pas-de-Calais, but will not be able to stand again in a future parliamentary election for the duration of her ban on running for office.\n\nLe Pen took over the leadership of the Front National from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011 and began a drive to sanitise the party’s jackbooted, antisemitic image.\n\nShe renamed the party National Rally in 2018, wanting it to be viewed as a potential governing force, not just a protest movement, and has run for president three times, twice making it to the final run-off against Emmanuel Macron.\n\nIn 2022, Le Pen provided the far right with its highest-ever tally in a French presidential election, winning more than 13m votes.\n\nAn Ifop poll published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper this weekend found Le Pen could have won 34-37% in the first round of the next presidential election and her fate in the run-off second round would depend on whether all her opponents united to vote against her.\n\nThe party will now have to decide who would take her place in the next French presidential race. Bardella, a member of the European parliament, is popular among voters but is seen as having little experience.",

        "content": "From 6h ago 04.40 EDT Global cost of 2025 tariff war could reach $1.4tn, report finds A full-blown trade war between the US and its trading partners could cost $1.4tn, a new report shows. Economists at Aston Business School have modelled a range of potential scenarios, including the possibility that America it hit by full global retaliation after it announces new tariffs against other countries. That full-scale trade conflict could result in a $1.4 trillion global welfare loss, Aston has calculated. The report explains that tariff escalation leads to higher prices, reduced competitiveness, and fragmented supply chains, as we saw in 2018 in the US-China trade war. It says: Donald Trump’s 2025 return to power has unleashed a gale of protectionism, reshaping global trade within weeks. They outline six scenarios, from the first wave of tariffs already announced against Canada, Mexico and China to a full-blown trade war. Here are the key findings: US initial tariffs: US prices rise 2.7% and real GPD per capita declines 0.9%. Welfare declines in Canada by 3.2% and Mexico by 5%. Retaliation by Canada, Mexico and China: US loss deepens to 1.1%, welfare declines in Canada by 5.1% and Mexico by 7.1%. US imposes 25% tariffs on EU goods: Sharp transatlantic trade contraction, EU production disruptions, US welfare declines 1.5%. EU retaliates with 25% tariff on US goods: Prices rise across US and EU, mutual welfare losses and intensified negative outcomes for the US. UK experiences modest trade diversion benefits. US global tariff: Severe global trade contraction and substantial price hikes substantially affect North American welfare and UK trade volumes. Full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs: Extensive global disruption and reduced trade flows, severe US welfare losses, $1.4 trillion global welfare loss projected. The full-blown trade war (scenario 6) would have “profound implications” for interconnected economies like the UK. The report says: As a trade-dependent nation navigating post-Brexit realities, the UK stands at a crossroads. Trump’s tariffs disrupt supply chains and exports, yet might open doors for rerouting, with high potential for exporting much more to the U.S. The dual-edged impacts are stark: fleeting export gains collide with vulnerabilities in critical sectors like automotive and tech, while EU divergence risks, amplified by regulatory misalignment and political distrust, threaten its efforts in resetting the UK-EU relationship. So while the UK can use its post-Brexit flexibility to mitigate risks and leverage new trade routes, sustained gains depend on rebuilding EU ties and supporting a rules-based international trade order, they add. Share Updated at 04.47 EDT\n\n7m ago 10.22 EDT US factory production stalls as tariff uncertainty hits orders Production at US factories declined last month as order book growth slowed due to tariff uncertainty, new data shows. The latest healthcheck on American manufacturing shows that growth stalled in March. with production falling and order books only expanding modestly. S&P Global’s poll of purchasing managers also found that confidence in the outlook for business activity “softened”, amid “some uncertainty over the impact of federal government policies”. This pulled S&P Global’s US Manufacturing PMI down to 50.2 in March, down from 52.7 in February, only just above the level showing stagnation. Manufacturers are worried that trade tensions will lead to lower orders, explainsChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence: “The strong start to the year for US manufacturers has faltered in March. A combination of improved optimism surrounding the new administration and the need to front-run tariffs had buoyed the goods-producing sector in the first two months of the year, but cracks are now starting to appear. Production fell for the first time in three months in March, and order books are becoming increasingly depleted. While business confidence about the outlook remains relatively elevated by standards seen over the past three years, this is based on companies hoping that the nearterm disruption caused by tariffs and other policies will be superseded as longer-term benefits from the policies of the new administration accrue. However, March has seen more producers question this belief. Business optimism about the year ahead has deteriorated further from January’s near threeyear high, and has dropped sharply over the past two months, causing firms to stop raising payroll counts for the first time since October. A key concern among manufacturers is the degree to which heightened uncertainty resulting from government policy changes, notably in relation to tariffs, causes customers to cancel or delay spending, and the extent to which costs are rising and supply chains deteriorating in this environment. Tariffs were the most cited cause of factory input costs rising in March, and at a rate not seen since mid-2022 during the pandemic-related supply shock. Supply chains are also suffering to a degree not seen since October 2022 as delivery delays become more widespread.

Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst for Interactive Investor, has warned that the UK will be affected by the trade war, even if it manages to dodge direct tariffs: “President Donald Trump’s tariffs war could have far-reaching consequences for Britons, even if the UK manages to escape direct levies. “If tariffs contribute to higher inflation, central banks may be forced to tighten monetary policy, which can weigh on bonds and borrowing costs. “This could impact everything from mortgage rates to corporate investment, potentially slowing economic growth. “For investors with exposure to US equities – either directly or through pension funds and ISAs – this could translate into market turbulence.” Share\n\n46m ago 09.43 EDT Wall Street falls on Liberation Day Eve Over in New York, shares have fallen at the start of trading.

Investors fear it could stoke inflation while simultaneously weighing on economic growth—a toxic mix for an already shaky market. Share\n\n2h ago 08.36 EDT Investors have been catching their breath today after a volatile first three months of the year. The first quarter of 2025 was “historical” in several ways, say analysts at Deutsche Bank. As well as the launch of Donald Trump’s tariffs, there was a “huge fiscal regime shift” in Europe with Germany taking steps to boost borrowing and spending, and the launch of new AI models by China’s DeepSeek. Amid the volatility, virtually all global assets were positive in return terms, outside of US equities. Here’s the details: Gold prices (+19.0%) saw their strongest quarterly gain since 1986. That’s partly due to concerns around inflation, with the US 1yr inflation swap (+72bps) rising to 3.25%.\n\nAt the other end, US tech stocks had a very rough time, with the Magnificent 7 (-16.0%) posting its biggest quarterly decline since Q2 2022, back when the Fed pivoted towards 75bp rate hikes to deal with inflation. Similarly, the NASDAQ fell -10.3%.\n\nIn Europe, equities saw a much brighter performance given the fiscal shift, even if they gave up some of those gains in the second half of March. For instance, the DAX surged by +16.3% in Q1 in US dollar terms, which got some help thanks to the +4.5% appreciation of the Euro against the US Dollar in the quarter.\n\nThat said, Euro sovereign bonds struggled, and March 5 saw the 10yr bund yield post its biggest daily jump since German reunification, with an astonishing +29.8bps move. Over the quarter as a whole, it was up +37bps to 2.74%.\n\nWith investors moving out of US assets, the US Dollar weakened against other major currencies, with the dollar index down -3.9% over the quarter. In fact, the dollar weakened against every other G10 currency apart from the Canadian dollar in Q1, which faced the impact of US tariffs.

Chaired by former DWP permanent secretary, Sir Robert Devereux, the review will report by the summer. Its findings will be handed to cabinet office permanent secretary, Cat Little, and another Sir Robert (Chote, in this case), chair of the UK Statistics Authority.

Alex Mahon said that if the government pursues its proposed plan, to give AI companies access to creative works unless the copyright holder opts out, it would put the UK creative industries in a “dangerous position”. “AI is clearly absolutely critical to the future of our industry, and many industries,” she said, speaking at the House of Commons culture select committee of MPs on Tuesday. “The debate of the day is we need very clear terms. UK copyright law is are very, very clear. And what is happening at the moment is the scraping of value from our creative industries.” Critics of the government’s opt-out proposal, issued in a consultation that closed in February, argue that it is unfair and impractical. Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as CharGPT, are trained on vast amounts of data to generate highly realistic responses. Mahon said that allowing large language models (LLMs) to continue to freely scrape data poses a major threat to the creative industry, which generates £125bn in gross value added (GVA), a measure of how much value companies add through the goods and services they produce. “The creative industries account for 6% of the UK’s GVA and is growing 1.5 times faster than other sectors,” she said. “If we continue in a world where LLMs can scrape and use that data without paying for it properly we are in a dangerous position for the industry.” Mahon said that Channel 4 is “very clear” that the copyright regime should be “opt-in”. “The burden should be on them, not us,” she said. “We are very clear we think that LLMs need to licence what they use and pay properly for it. We can’t have automated scraping, we need a proper payment and licensing regime.” Share\n\n4h ago 06.48 EDT Goldman Sachs cuts forecast for UK growth due to tariff spillovers Goldman Sachs have cut their forecast for UK growth this year, due to the economic damage that new US tariffs will cause, even if Britain ultimately avoids them. In a new research note today, Goldman say they assume that the US does impose duties on critical goods imports from the UK, but also that the UK ultimately avoids reciprocal tariffs given the balanced trade between the two countries (which could happen if a trade deal is agreed). Even so, though, Goldman have trimmed 0.1 percentage point off their forecast for UK growth this year, and in 2026, saying: However, our updated global baseline now assumes notably larger US tariffs on other economies including the EU. We have consequently downgraded our 2025 growth forecasts for both the US and the Euro area, implying greater spillovers to the UK. As such, we now see a larger total hit to UK GDP from trade tensions even if the UK does avoid a reciprocal tariff. We therefore lower our UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.8% (from 0.9%) and for 2026 to 1.2% (from 1.3%).

Share\n\n4h ago 06.38 EDT If the US were to maintain tariffs at 20% or 25% on the UK for five years it would “knock out all the headroom the Government currently has”, the UK’s fiscal watchdog has warned. Giving evidence to the Treasury Committee on the spring statement, OBR member David Miles said: “If tariffs at 20, 25% were put on the UK and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the Government currently has. “Had we made that a central forecast, and had the Government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. “Of course that would have been in some ways, a very extreme assumption. Because not only would that be as bad as people might expect in the very near term, but it would have been maintained for five years, which is beyond the next presidential election in the US.” Rachel Reeves maintained her headroom to hit her debt targets in last week’s spring statement, by announcing new cuts to welfare spending. Miles also suggested that a “very limited tariff war” could be “mildly” beneficial for the UK economy, if we kept out of it! He explained: “There’s a bit of trade that will get diverted to the UK, and some of the exports from China, for example, that would have gone to the US, they’ll be looking for a home for them in the rest of the world. “And stuff would be available in the UK a bit cheaper than otherwise would have been. So there is one, not central scenario at all, which is very, very mildly potentially positive to the UK. All the other ones which involve the UK facing tariffs are negative, and they’re negative to very different extents.” Share\n\n4h ago 06.24 EDT Tomorrow could bring “trepidation not liberation” says Rupert Thompson, chief economist at IBOSS (part of financial services group Kingswood). On Trump’s “Liberation Day” he writes: The range and size of the tariff increases remains quite uncertain, not least because of the complexity of the issue and the sheer difficulty in assessing the appropriate tariff for differing goods/countries. That said, the tariff hikes are looking likely to be significantly higher than was generally expected a couple of months ago. As with all his proclamations on tariffs, it is impossible to know whether and for how long they will actually be implemented. And on the recession risks to the US, he adds: The hit to US growth over the coming year looks likely to be of the order of 1% or so depending on the size of the tariff hikes. However, we continue to believe a fall into recession is unlikely. The economy proved unexpectedly resilient to Fed jacking up rates in 2022. And with the consumer and the corporate sector still in pretty good shape, it is well placed to withstand the self-harm now being inflicted. Share\n\n4h ago 06.04 EDT Heather Stewart As Office for Budget Responsibility chair Richard Hughes continues his evidence to MPs on the cross-party treasury select committee, he has underlined the challenges of forecasting at the moment, on the basis of shonky data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Hughes said the OBR currently receives “an incomplete picture from different points in time,” from the ONS - with GDP and jobs market data updated on different timescales. He says: “Waiting for either the numerator or the denominator to be updated when you’re either looking at one or the other is not a good place to be; and so I think quality, timeliness and consistency of the main economic data sets are the things that are most important to us as forecasters.” Hughes’s colleague David Miles also gave an alarming insight into the importance of hard-to-estimate productivity growth, on the overall forecast. If productivity growth does not recover as the OBR expects, from “dismal” rates in the last two years, by the end of the five year forecast, “that would mean that the current deficit is something like £50bn,” instead of the £10bn surplus in last week’s projections, Miles warned, adding, “it’s absolutely enormous.” Share\n\n5h ago 05.52 EDT BoE's Greene: trade war uncertainty could hurt dollar's reserve status Bank of England interest rate setter Megan Greene has warned that the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency could be hurt by trade war uncertainty.

Exchange rates were likely to be a key way the effect of trade wars would be transmitted across economies, Greene explained, adding: “It’s also possible that the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency could be undermined a little bit by all of the uncertainty that we’re seeing, and so we don’t know how the exchange rate will behave.” Share\n\n5h ago 05.47 EDT Von der Leyen: EU will retaliate against US tariffs if necessary Lisa O'Carroll The EU will react strongly to any reciprocal tariffs the US may impose on its exports, Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president has warned.

Our objective is a negotiated solution. But of course, if need be, we will protect our interests, our people, and our companies.” “Our objective is a negotiated solution. But of course, if need be, we will protect our interests, our people and our companies. I want to be very clear on the aim of our response. We think that this confrontation is in no one’s interest.

The drop was due to lower energy prices – which fell by 0.7%, following a 0.2% rise in February. Services inflation slowed to 3.4%, from 3.7%, although food, alcohol & tobacco inflation picked up to 2.9%, from 2.7%, and goods prices rose by 0.6% having been unchanged in February. But a global trade war could have implications for prices in the eurozone, and beyond. ING economist Bert Colijn explains: Uncertainty around the short-term outlook for inflation remains very high. US tariffs could result in deflationary pressures on the eurozone market as they depress exports and therefore growth. Besides that, it also results in more supply in the eurozone market as the US increases barriers to access. Retaliatory measures from the European Commission will likely have an upward effect on eurozone inflation, though, as they are essentially a domestic tax that gets introduced and will be paid for by consumers to some extent.

The Office for Statistics Regulation says it was “entirely misleading” to claim in a recent press release that the number of people claiming disability elements of Universal Credit has increased by 383% in the last five years. Rob Kent-Smith, deputy head of the Office for Statistics Regulation, wrote in a letter to Sir Peter Schofield, Permanent Secretary at the DWP: The figure does not recognise that the majority of this increase is due to the process of migrating people from legacy benefits, such as Employment and Support Allowance, to Universal Credit over the last few years. When these people are accounted for, the actual increase in the number of people claiming disability elements of Universal Credit is 50%. After we raised concerns with DWP, the press release was amended on 27th March. The updated version of the press release includes some references to people moving from other benefits and acknowledges that the number of people with no requirement to look for work across Universal Credit health and other benefits since the pandemic has increased by 50%. However, we consider that these additions do not go far enough. Kent-Smith is asking the DWP to update the press release by Friday to remove references to the 383% figure, and not use the figure again.

Appearing before MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee to discuss last week’s spring statement, Hughes was asked whether he would like to stay in the post, after his first term ends on 3 October. He replied: “I have written to the chancellor, to the effect that I would be interested in serving a second and final term, earlier this year.” Asked whether he had heard back from Rachel Reeves, he said he hadn’t, but added: “I appreciate that the chancellor has a lot on her plate at the moment”. The OBR’s role in economic policymaking has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, as Reeves implemented spending cuts to ensure she is on course to meet her fiscal rules - including £500m of last minute welfare reforms, after the OBR rejected the government’s costing of its plans. Hughes also sought to reassure committee chair Meg Hillier that he did not believe leaks of aspects of the forecast before the spring statement had come from within the OBR. “I am satisfied that the OBR is not the source,” he said, adding that the Treasury had commenced its own leak inquiry.

Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”\n\nThe bodies of the three soldiers were recovered after a massive six-day effort by US, Polish and Lithuanian armed forces and authorities to dig the M88 Hercules armoured recovery vehicle out of a peat bog.\n\nSearch and rescue teams worked with heavy equipment and excavators to remove silt from the water before eventually towing the vehicle out early on Monday.\n\n“Three US army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored brigade combat team, 3rd infantry division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” US Army Europe and Africa’s public affairs office said in a statement. The soldiers’ identities were being “withheld pending notification of next of kin”, it added.\n\nHundreds of local and foreign troops and other rescue workers, including engineers and divers, were involved in the rescue operation to recover the armoured vehicle.\n\nLithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and search-and-rescue personnel. They brought in additional excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts and several hundred tonnes of gravel and earth to help the recovery.\n\nUS navy divers were able to manoeuvre through thick layers of mud, clay and sediment “with zero visibility” to reach the 63-tonne vehicle on Sunday evening and find two points to attach steel cables, according to the command.\n\nThe command said that during the effort to pull the vehicle out, it began to lose traction, so additional heavy bulldozers were brought in and attached to provide additional grip. The vehicle was pulled free after about two hours.\n\nThe US navy dive team is searching the area using radar for the missing fourth soldier.\n\n\n\nMaj Gen Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored division, thanked the “heroic efforts” of those involved in the search and recovery.

Gas pollution might form in isolated areas around the eruption depending on wind direction and is closely monitored.”\n\nValsson added: “The eruption is still developing and we will publish further information, when gathered.”\n\nAlthough there was an initial effect on tourist numbers after the November 2023 eruption – which the tourism board in part blames on international reporting – since then, numbers have slightly increased.\n\nThe number of foreign nationals coming through Keflavík airport rose by 2% to 2,261,391 in 2023-24 compared with the same period the year before, according to Statistics Iceland.

Smith, speaking as Senator Cory Booker yielded for a question on the Senate floor, said Trump was “seek(ing) to emulate the authoritarian regimes that he so openly admires”. She noted the number of international students targeted for arrest and deportation in recent weeks because of their participation in protests in support of Palestine. “These are young people who play by all the rules,” Smith said. Their views on the war in Gaza may differ sharply from mine or others, but I believe that the first amendment guarantees them the right to express those views without facing punishment or reprisal from our government. She said the arrests had been carried out in a manner “that seems calculated to maximize fear and intimidation in immigrant and activist communities”. Smith said: Does punishing people for their political speech seem consistent with American democratic values? I can’t believe that. Share\n\n2h ago 08.51 EDT Senator Cory Booker, who is now more than 13 hours into his marathon speech on the Senate floor, accused the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress of “putting profits over people”. Booker said: They are trying to gut Medicaid and Medicare, programs on which nearly a third of our country rely – all to pay for tax cuts to billionaires and corporations. Booker also said social security “is not the government’s money to spend” but the “hard-earned savings of working Americans that belongs to Americans,” adding: [Donald] Trump and [Elon] Musk need to keep their hands off of money that isn’t theirs to take. Share\n\n2h ago 08.33 EDT Staff at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have started receiving notice that their jobs are being cut, Reuters reports. The news agency, citing an FDA employee, reports that staff on Tuesday morning had to present their badges at the building entrance and those who had been fired were given a ticket and told to return home. Fired staff at the CDC worked for the National Center for Environmental Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), it says. Share Updated at 09.39 EDT\n\n2h ago 08.26 EDT Mass layoffs begin at federal health agencies Some employees at federal health agencies began receiving notices of dismissal on Tuesday morning, according to reports, days after the US department of health and human services (HHS) announced it planned to cut 10,000 full-time jobs. An email addressed to an employee at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obtained by CNN, reads: This action does not reflect directly on your service, performance or conduct. The email states that the person would be placed on administrative leave and would no longer have access to building as of Tuesday, the outlet reports. HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy announced the planned cuts as part of a sweeping organization of the department which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, and monitoring the safety of food and medicine, as well as for administering health insurance programs for nearly half of the country, Associated Press reports. The layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff – 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers, according to the news agency. Share Updated at 08.29 EDT\n\n3h ago 07.51 EDT Eric Berger Rightwing groups around the US are pushing legislation that would place new limits on what books are allowed in school libraries in a move that critics decry as censorship often focused on LGBTQ+ issues, race or imposing conservative social values. Caught up in the attempts at suppressing books are classics like The Color Purple and Slaughterhouse-Five. Opponents of such bills argue that they would actually hinder individual rights because the proponents would be imposing their beliefs on parents and children who do not share their views. Those campaigning for the restrictions say it would prevent children from being exposed to what they label sexually explicit and obscene content and increase parental rights. There are at least 112 proposed state bills concerning school – and public – libraries that seek to expand the definition of what is deemed obscene or “harmful to minors” and to limit librarian staff’s ability to determine which books are in their collections, according to the American Library Association.

        "content": "China has launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan, accusing its leaders of being “separatists” and “parasites” who were pushing the democratically run island into war.\n\nThe drills, accompanied by a propaganda campaign, were launched without warning on Tuesday morning. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they were a “stern warning” to Taiwan’s democratically elected government over what Beijing claims is separatist activity.\n\n“China’s reunification is an unstoppable trend - it will happen, and it must happen,” Guo Jiakun, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nForces from the PLA Navy, Army and Rocket Force were approaching Taiwan from “multiple directions”, said China’s Eastern Theatre Command, which manages military operations in the region, on its official WeChat social media account.\n\nIt said the drills would focus on “combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes”.\n\nThe Command later said China’s Coast Guard was also involved, conducting what it called “law-enforcement patrols” close to Taiwan’s main island. A key element of China’s military advancement has been the integration of non-military arms, including the Coast Guard, and its maritime militia fleet of fishing boats, and the conversion or creation of civilian ships for military transport.\n\n“These drills are concrete actions to exercise legitimate jurisdiction and control over the Island in accordance with the one-China principle,” said Zhu Anqing, a China Coast Guard spokesperson.\n\nTaiwan’s defence ministry said it had detected 71 PLA aircraft and at least 19 Navy and Coast Guard vessels on Tuesday , including the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong. More than 10 of the ships approached close to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, which stretches 24 nautical miles (44km) from the coast, military officials told Reuters. Taiwan’s military had deployed aircraft, Navy ships, and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.\n\nBeijing claims Taiwan is Chinese territory and is building capability to seize it by military force. Analysts believe it is not there yet, but has been making significant advances and in the meantime uses military pressure – such as drills – and other coercive means to push Taiwan towards submission.\n\n“‘Taiwan independence’ means war, and pursuing ‘Taiwan independence’ means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, claimed in a statement.\n\n5:03 How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - video\n\nTaiwan, which is recognised as a country by around a dozen others mostly in the Pacific and Caribbean, operates as a sovereign state with its own democratically elected government, military and currency. Its government and people overwhelmingly oppose the prospect of Chinese rule.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office spokesperson, Wen Lii, condemned China’s “escalatory behaviour” and “military provocations”, linking it to other recent exercises near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and in the South China Sea.\n\n“China’s wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve hegemony in the western Pacific.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other imagery called Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite courting ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan’s febrile domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political persecution.\n\nChina has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to perceived acts of separatism or pro-independence. Lai, who was elected last year to continue the rule of the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party, has taken a forthright approach to cross-strait tensions. Last month he declared China to be a “foreign hostile force” under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to counter its growing influence and espionage operations. His speech and measures were specifically cited in Tuesday’s propaganda.\n\nAmanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China practice, said Tuesday’s propaganda “makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump’s election”.\n\n“This is primarily about Lai’s 13 March speech which Beijing found provocative,” she said. “The publicity around the exercise likely also has the US in mind – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”\n\nTuesday’s drills have differed slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan’s government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the guise of a drill.\n\nOn Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had elevated its readiness level to ensure China didn’t “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.\n\nThe drills appeared to be of similar size to the PLA’s “Joint Sword” exercises held in 2023 and 2024, but were unnamed, which a Chinese military analyst told state media was a sign of such activity being “normalised”.\n\nThe US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, has visited several Asian countries in recent days, emphasising that countering China and deterring it from attacking Taiwan was a key priority for the US.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Hell is empty and all the devils are in Washington DC. And, what with devils being immortal and all, it looks as if they might stay there indefinitely. Now, before I seamlessly segue from fun devil facts into talking about Donald Trump threatening to run for a third term, the current political climate compels me to make a few things clear. I recently had to submit my US green card for renewal (impeccable timing!) so I’d like to explain to any United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers reviewing my file that the first line of this piece was just riffing on Shakespeare. I’m absolutely not comparing Trump, the greatest man to walk this Earth, to Satan. Nor am I suggesting evil people seem to live long lives.\n\nOn the contrary, I am thrilled that our 78-year-old president has suggested he is looking into “methods” that will allow him to serve this wonderful country longer. And it’s a shame my enthusiasm isn’t universally shared. I mean, to quote JD Vance (who is up there next to Shakespeare in the words department), have any Trump detractors SAID THANK YOU ONCE? Trump could be relaxing with his billions; he could be playing golf every day. Instead, the poor man only gets to play golf every few days – costing taxpayers millions of dollars – and has to spend most of his time sorting out the US. The economy doesn’t just crash itself, you know? So thank you, Mr President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nBut, look, while I’m obviously overjoyed by the idea that our esteemed leader might stick around far longer than norms, conventions and the constitution allow, just how realistic a prospect is Trump 3.0? The president has insisted he is “not joking” about seeking a third term in office, but is all this talk just a tactic to distract us from what he is getting up to in his current term?\n\nObviously, I can’t tell you what goes on in the murky depths of Trump’s mind. But I can tell you this: Trump has no regard for norms or laws, and will do whatever he wants if he thinks he can get away with it.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask isn’t whether Trump is serious about extending his rule, but – should he seek a third term – who might stop him? Unless they all get spine transplants, the Democrats aren’t going to put up a fight. Want to know what Kamala Harris is doing now? Getting ready to speak at a real estate conference in Australia. It’s obviously not Harris’s job to safeguard US democracy but, after raising enormous amounts of money from regular people who believed in her campaign promises, you would think she might care a little more about the optics.\n\nAs for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader – the person whose job it actually is to represent the opposition – his strategy for dealing with Trump appears to be to give Republicans whatever they want and hope that, somehow, this turns out badly for them. It’s not surprising then, that a recent survey showed 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below.\n\nIt is not just the Democrats who appear to have capitulated to Trump: a number of big legal firms have also bowed down to the president’s efforts to get them to comply with his interpretation of the law. Elite universities such as Columbia University have also caved in to Trump’s demands. Even the White House Correspondents’ Association just cancelled an appearance by an anti-Trump comedian in an attempt to stay on the president’s good side. And, as we all know, Silicon Valley has been bending the knee to Trump for months.\n\nMeanwhile, as any opposition to Trump seems to evaporate, Elon Musk is running around handing out checks to voters in Wisconsin in what many critics have characterised as an attempt to influence the state’s supreme court election. Even if Trump doesn’t go for a third term, even if the Democrats win the next election, the US’s descent into techno-authoritarianism isn’t going to be easily reversed. Not, to be clear to any USCIS officers reading this, that I’m complaining. Not little old me! I’m renaming my daughter Donalda, getting a Tesla tattoo, and cheering as all my rights are systematically taken away.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "As Donald Trump prepared to unveil a swathe of reciprocal tariffs, global markets braced and some Republican senators voiced their opposition to a strategy that critics warn risks a global trade war, provoking retaliation by major trading partners such as China, Canada and the European Union.\n\nThe US president said on Monday he would be “very kind” to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, potentially as early as Tuesday night.\n\nThe Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world’s biggest economy has been “ripped off by every country in the world”, promising “Liberation Day” for the US.\n\nHe could also unveil more sector-specific levies.\n\nAsked for details, he told reporters on Monday: “You’re going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday.”\n\nBut he added: “We’re going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we’re going to be very kind.”\n\nSome Republican senators spoke out against Trump’s tariffs on Canada and are considering signing on their support for a resolution blocking them, CNN reported. Senator Susan Collins warned that tariffs on Canada would be particularly harmful to Maine and that she intended to vote for a resolution aimed at blocking tariffs against Canadian goods.\n\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis also said he was considering backing the resolution, adding: “We need to fight battles with our foes first and then try to figure out any inequalities with our friends second.”\n\nAlready, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump’s expected tariff announcement.\n\nBut Trump said on Monday he was not worried that his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the goal on Wednesday would be to announce “country-based tariffs”, although Trump remained committed to imposing separate sector-specific charges.\n\nThe uncertainty has jolted markets, with key European and Asian indexes closing lower, although the Dow and broad-based S&P 500 eked out gains.\n\nMarket nervousness intensified after Trump said on Sunday his tariffs would include “all countries”.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that advisers have considered imposing global tariffs of up to 20%, to hit almost all US trading partners. Trump has remained vague, saying his tariffs would be “far more generous” than ones already levied against US products.\n\nTrump’s fixation on tariffs is fanning US recession fears. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%.\n\nThis reflects a “lower growth forecast, falling confidence and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain”. Goldman Sachs also lifted its forecast for underlying inflation at the end of 2025.\n\nChina and Canada have imposed counter-tariffs on US goods, while the EU unveiled its own measures to start mid-April. Other countermeasures could come after Wednesday.\n\nFor now, the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said at a Reuters event on Monday that US tariffs were causing anxiety, although their global economic impact should not be dramatic.\n\nRyan Sweet of Oxford Economics said to “expect the unexpected”, anticipating that Trump would “take aim at some of the largest offenders”.\n\nBesides reciprocal country tariffs, Trump could unveil additional sector-specific levies on the likes of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He earlier announced car tariffs to take effect on Thursday.\n\nEconomists have expected the upcoming salvo could target the 15% of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the US, a group that the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has dubbed a “Dirty 15”.\n\nThe US has some of its biggest goods deficits with China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada and India.\n\nUS trade partners are rushing to minimise their exposure, with reports suggesting India may lower some duties.\n\nThe European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that Europe should move towards economic independence, telling France Inter radio that Europe faces an “existential moment”.\n\nSeparately, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke with Trump on “productive negotiations” towards a UK-US trade deal, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU would respond firmly to Trump but was open to compromise.\n\nIt was “entirely possible” for fresh tariffs to be swiftly reduced or put on hold, said Greta Peisch, a partner at law firm Wiley Rein.\n\nIn February, Washington paused steep levies on Mexican and Canadian imports for a month as the North American neighbours pursued negotiations.\n\nWith Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein who once alleged she was sexually trafficked to Britain’s Prince Andrew, says she has just days to live after being involved in a vehicle accident.\n\n“This year has been the worst start to a new year … I won’t bore anyone with the details, but I think it important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110km as we were slowing for a turn no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can,” she wrote in a post on social media on Sunday, along with a photograph of herself lying in a hospital bed with a head injury.\n\n“I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology,” she said. “I’m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes.”\n\n“Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life,” she added.\n\nHer father, Sky Roberts, commented on the post and said: “Virginia my daughter, I love you and [am] praying for you to get the correct treatment to live a long and healthy life.”\n\n“If there is anything in this world I can do to help you, please let me know,” he added. “My spirit with you now and holding your hand.”\n\nIn a statement, Giuffre’s representative, Dini von Mueffling, told the Guardian that Giuffre had “been in a serious accident and is receiving medical care in the hospital”. She added: “She greatly appreciates the support and well wishes people are sending.”\n\nGiuffre is one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, and also alleged she was abused by Prince Andrew. She was last reported to be living in Australia.\n\nA social media post from four weeks ago suggested Giuffre was in Perth in early March. Western Australia police said on Tuesday there was “a report of a minor crash” between a school bus and a car in Neergabby, north of Perth, on 24 March at about 3pm.\n\n“The collision was reported by the bus driver the following day,” a police spokesperson said. “The car sustained approximately A$2,000 worth of damage. There were no reported injuries as a result of the crash.”\n\nWA police confirmed the driver of the car was a 41-year-old woman.\n\nThe Guardian understands that Giuffre presented to a Perth hospital emergency department on Tuesday 1 April.\n\nGiuffre had been living in a home in Ocean Reef – a northern suburb of Perth – with her husband Robert Giuffre, who purchased the property in late 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew in federal court in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17.\n\nAndrew has repeatedly and strongly denied the accusations.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein and his longtime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell had introduced her to Andrew in 2001, and alleged that Maxwell forced her to have sex with Andrew.\n\nIn 2022, Andrew and Giuffre agreed to an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMaxwell, who has maintained her innocence, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking.\n\nEpstein was arrested by federal authorities in July 2019 and charged with sex-trafficking counts. Shortly after, he died by suicide while awaiting trial.\n\nAdditional reporting Rafqa Touma",

        "content": "A sense of chaos has gripped the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), one of the world’s premier research agencies, with key staff hastily fired and then rehired, cuts to vital weather forecasting operations and even a new, unsecured server that led to staff being deluged by obscene spam emails.\n\nNoaa is currently being upended by Donald Trump’s desire to slash the federal government workforce, with more than 1,000 people already fired or resigning from the agency and 1,000 more staffers are expected to be removed as the purge continues. In total, this represents around 20% of the Noaa’s workforce.\n\nAlong with leading climate and marine research, Noaa also houses the National Weather Service, which provides bedrock weather forecasts to private providers and the public. There are concerns that the Trump administration’s cuts, spearheaded by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), could imperil public safety by hindering timely warnings of tornadoes and hurricanes.\n\nDoge has already had to reverse some of its initial firings after removing staff including those who help track hurricanes. Five people involved in the “hurricane hunter” flights were fired, only for three of them to be told their jobs will be reinstated. Other staff within the National Weather Service have also been asked to disregard their terminations.\n\nNoaa’s data collection activity is still being affected, though, with the agency reducing the number of weather balloons it releases in six locations across the US. The balloons, fitted with weather instruments, are crucial in providing the information for weather forecasts.\n\nThis tumultuous era for Noaa was for some staff crystallized by Doge’s decision to use a new email server to send missives from the federal government’s office of personnel ganagement to the agency. The email server was not secure, meaning that staff got dozens of spam-like emails in January, one of them with a lewd title about the president and another stating: “the next 4 years has an [sic] 99% chance of shit showers.”\n\nWhile Noaa has since resolved the lack of email server security, staff said that it was emblematic of growing turmoil within the agency.\n\n“The feeling has been ‘you’ve got to be kidding me,’” said one staffer, who was fired but is now on administrative leave pending potential reinstatement.\n\n“These people at Doge think they are the best at what they do but they can’t even protect an email list. They fired people and then had to hire them back, they are cutting contracts without learning what they are. I mean good lord take a minute before doing this. It’s an absolute joke.”\n\nSome former Noaa staff and elected Democrats have held recent protests outside the agency’s headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, warning that the cuts risk hampering the flow of crucial weather and climate information, as well as regulatory work around fisheries that prevent the over-exploitation of the oceans.\n\n“Dysfunction is the polite way of putting it, you could also say it is incompetent chaos,” said Andrew Rosenberg, formerly the deputy director of Noaa’s national marine fisheries service.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you were looking at the inverse of efficiency, this would be it.”\n\nRosenberg said remaining Noaa staff are striving to continue their work but the mission of the agency is being degraded.\n\n“A year from now people will notice things are missing that used to be there and Doge and others promoting this will say: ‘See, told you government can’t do things’, rather than: ‘We broke it and it got worse,’” he said.\n\n“Noaa staff right now aren’t happy because they don’t know if they will keep their jobs. Work has been made harder for no reason and they are being told they are worthless. No one has even explained why they are doing all of this crap.”\n\nNoaa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Donald Trump’s suggestion that there are “methods” by which he could run for a third term as US president has been met with scorn – but also warnings that he could seriously attempt it, despite being explicitly barred from doing so by the US constitution.\n\n“The biggest mistake of the last eight years is that we somehow failed to give credibility to Donald Trump’s whims and impulses, but we know it’s true,” David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, told MSNBC.\n\n“January 6 was a perfect example. If he says he’s not ruling it out, then he’s not ruling it out, and we should consider it a constitutional threat.”\n\nOn Sunday Trump was asked on NBC’s Meet the Press about if there were plans for him to stay on in a third term as president. “Well, there are plans,” Trump said. “There are – not plans. There are methods – there are methods which you could do it, as you know.\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump added.\n\nThe 22nd amendment of the constitution states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.”\n\nTrump has previously suggested that he might serve a third term as president, and recently referred to himself as a “king”.\n\nJohn Dean, an attorney who served as counsel to former president Richard Nixon, said that debate over whether a US president can run for a third term is not new, citing a kind of “loophole” that some Trump backers have suggested using – namely, a term-limited president becoming a vice-presidential candidate, and then assuming the top job if the new president steps aside once elected.\n\n“A lot of people thought [Barack] Obama should go for another term, he didn’t,” Dean told CNN. “He read the constitution and said ‘I’m not for end runs’.”\n\nDemocrats have attacked Trump for his rhetoric, claiming it follows a pattern of authoritarian posturing by the president.\n\n“This is what dictators do,” said Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\n“In three months, Trump has crashed the stock market and spiked costs. Now, he’s scheming for a third term instead of doing anything to make Americans’ lives better.”\n\nJasmine Crockett, a Democratic congresswoman, posted on social media: “The Constitution isn’t optional, sir.

Trump won the 2016 election but lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden before winning again last year.\n\nThe chances of such an amendment would be remote given the divided nature of politics in the US: it requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, then ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures.\n\nOn Sunday, though, John Curtis, a Republican senator, laughingly dismissed the idea of a Trump third term. “I wouldn’t have supported a third term for George Washington,” Curtis told NBC. “That’s a no.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Two people linked to the alleged drugging death and robbery of a television sports reporter found dead in his hotel room days before February’s NFL Super Bowl had spent years using text messages to evidently coordinate furtively incapacitating others with pharmaceuticals and stealing from their financial accounts, according to multiple law enforcement sources.\n\nWhile investigators have not publicly elaborated on the relationship between the pair arrested in connection with the death of Adan Manzano, 27, outside of New Orleans, the Guardian has confirmed that Danette Colbert and Rickey White have previously listed the same home address in legal documents. And at some point in the months prior to Manzano’s death, Colbert accused White of domestic violence, implying a romantic involvement between the two.\n\nAuthorities investigating a case which has made national headlines booked Colbert, 48, with second-degree murder, suspecting she had given Manzano alcohol mixed with the pharmaceutical Xanax to incapacitate him before he died. She was also booked with stealing Manzano’s cellphone and credit card, with White accused of acting as Colbert’s accomplice to the theft allegations in particular.\n\nAccording to various sources familiar with the investigation, at least three times in the four weeks before Manzano’s death, Colbert and White texted about the personal identification numbers of other people’s financial accounts, including one which showed a balance of more than $95,000 on an ATM’s screen.\n\nThose messages formed part of a broader dialogue between the two dating back to at least 2022 in which they also mentioned at least three more pin numbers associated with other such accounts. In some of the messages, Colbert alludes to needing “knock outs” or wishing she had “KO” – which detectives have interpreted to mean pharmaceutical pills that if mixed with alcohol could render people unconscious as well as unable to resist a robbery.\n\nView image in fullscreen Adan Manzano, a 27-year-old anchor and reporter for Telemundo, in Kansas City, Missouri. Photograph: AP\n\nAt least one message from Colbert describes her waiting for a man to fall asleep before going to the ATM and reuniting with White, 34. Another message to White recounted how Colbert was handed a cellphone by someone who was extremely intoxicated and failed to immediately notice that Colbert sent herself $8,000 from a cash-related application on the device.\n\nPolice in charge of investigating Manzano’s death came to suspect Colbert was involved after finding surveillance video which captured her entering his hotel room in Kenner, Louisiana, near New Orleans’ airport, the last time he was seen alive during the early morning of 5 February. Kenner police said they later caught Colbert with Manzano’s cellphone as well as the credit card he used to check into his hotel before meeting her during a night out in New Orleans.\n\nFurthermore, police have said they seized alprazolam – a benzodiazepine whose brand name is Xanax – at Colbert’s home in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell after finding Manzano dead and face-down in a pillow.\n\nCoroner Dr Gerry Cvitanovich has said preliminary autopsy findings have the cause of death for Manzano listed as the combined toxic effects of Xanax, which can be used as a sedative, and alcohol, along with positional asphyxia. Neither Manzano nor Colbert had a prescription for Xanax, police have said.\n\nMeanwhile, sources told the Guardian that Colbert and White corresponded about a pin while she was with Manzano, about 20 minutes before she went into his hotel room and later left alone. The sources said Colbert and White exchanged about two dozen phone calls that morning. She allegedly used Manzano’s card for a purchase of less than $9 at a local convenience store.\n\nColbert also purportedly tried to use the card on an ATM there but could not complete any transaction after exceeding the number of allowable pin entry attempts.\n\nKenner police soon jailed Colbert with stealing from and defrauding Manzano specifically.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Kenner police\n\nOn 18 March, they added a count of second-degree murder, which can carry life imprisonment. Sources said Colbert admitted to investigators who questioned her that she had gone to Manzano’s room – but she sought to persuade them that the only way she would have his phone or credit card would be if he dropped them in her car while she gave him a ride to his hotel.\n\nPolice in Hollywood, Florida, captured White on 14 March on the same theft and fraud counts against Colbert. He was later extradited to the jail in Jefferson parish, Louisiana, whose jurisdiction includes Kenner, and could spend years in prison if eventually convicted as charged.\n\nNeither Colbert nor White was immediately granted bail, with authorities citing five felony convictions in Louisiana alone for Colbert. They have also referred to a well-documented history for Colbert of allegedly drugging victims, stealing from them and then avoiding substantial punishment.\n\nWhite, too, has an extensive criminal history, including pleading guilty to misdemeanor theft. One mark on his record involved his pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of illegal marijuana possession in 2023. The documents in that case provide an important clue about his ties to Colbert: he listed her home address in Slidell as his, and that is where police investigating Manzano’s death would later find Xanax.\n\nAdditionally, sometime in 2024, sources said that Colbert filed a domestic violence complaint against White with the St Tammany parish sheriff’s office in Louisiana, whose jurisdiction includes Slidell. Deputies obtained a warrant to arrest White in that case, and it was pending at the time of his Manzano-related arrest in Florida.\n\nManzano was originally from Mexico and graduated from Kansas State University. He developed a reputation for covering the Kansas City area’s various sports teams for that community’s Spanish-language Telemundo affiliate. The widowed father of a two-year-old girl had traveled to the New Orleans area to cover the Kansas City Chiefs’ 9 February showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX at the Caesars Superdome.\n\nThe Telemundo journalist’s colleagues realized something had gone wrong with Manzano when he missed a work meeting. That prompted them to alert the staff at his hotel, who found Manzano’s body while conducting a wellness check on him.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.\n\nXiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.\n\nArs Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.\n\nHe has also coauthored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.\n\n“None of This Is in Any Way Normal”\n\nIn recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a lead systems analyst and programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.\n\nAs reported by The Bloomingtonian and later the The Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma, located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.\n\nAttempts to locate Wang and Ma have so far been unsuccessful. An Indiana University spokesman didn't answer emailed questions asking if the couple was still employed by the university and why their profile pages, email addresses, and phone numbers had been removed. The spokesman provided the contact information for a spokeswoman at the FBI's field office in Indianapolis. In an email, the spokeswoman wrote: “The FBI conducted court authorized law enforcement activity at homes in Bloomington and Carmel Friday. We have no further comment at this time.”\n\nSearches of federal court dockets turned up no documents related to Wang, Ma, or any searches of their residences. The FBI spokeswoman didn't answer questions seeking which US district court issued the warrant and when, and whether either Wang or Ma is being detained by authorities. Justice Department representatives didn't return an email seeking the same information. An email sent to a personal email address belonging to Wang went unanswered at the time this post went live. Their resident status (e.g., US citizens or green card holders) is currently unknown.\n\nFellow researchers took to social media over the weekend to register their concern over the series of events.\n\n“None of this is in any way normal,” Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Mastodon. He continued: “Has anyone been in contact? I hear he’s been missing for two weeks and his students can’t reach him. How does this not get noticed for two weeks???”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "More Excellent Grinders\n\nConical-burr all rounders:\n\nBaratza Encore for $150: Baratza's original Encore is the Honda of the conical burr grinder world: easy to maintain, runs great, easy to use, lasts forever, replacement parts easy to find. It's been on the market largely unchanged for more than a decade. For not much more, the ESP offers beautiful adjustment on espresso settings, so I tend to recommend the added versatility. But the original Encore remains a solid entry-level choice.\n\nBaratza Virtuoso+ for $250: The Virtuoso+ uses the same burr set as the ESP, but is not quite as optimized for espresso. The biggest upgrade against the Encore ESP is a timer. Both have similar rock-solid but compact builds (although the Virtuoso is a little more stylish with its fitted grounds bin), 40 grind settings, and burr grinders for consistent grounds. The Virtuoso’s digital timer, however, is great for those wanting consistent coffee ground dosings each morning. You’ll have to dial in on your grind time versus coffee grounds output, but once you figure that out, you can walk away from the grinder and multitask if you please. —Tyler Shane\n\nOXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder With Scale for $285: Making great coffee consistently is all about measuring your variables, and this Oxo model comes with a built-in scale. Set your grind size, select the weight you want, hit Start, and walk away; it shuts itself off when it's done. This is a great way to streamline your morning ritual, but the device does spray off a few grounds—and at its price range, we tend to prefer the Fellow Opus or Baratza ESP as an all-rounder.\n\nKitchenAid Burr Grinder for $200: This KitchenAid is stylish and easy to clean, according to former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey, and the burrs are accessible thanks to their placement directly beneath the hopper. It also features precise dose control, with grind size controlled by a dial. For espresso lovers, one excellent feature is that you can swap the little container that catches the grounds with a holder for a portafilter.\n\nFlat burrs for drip and pour-over:\n\nWilfa Uniform for $349: This Wilfa has long been on our list as a great flat-burr grinder for pour-overs and drip. It remains such, though the Ode springboarded it as the top pick with its Gen 2 burr update, at about the same price. Like its name suggests, the Wilfa offers a beautifully consistent grind size and will make you a lovely pour-over. That said, it's a little fussier to adjust and louder than the Ode.\n\nBaratza Vario W+ for $600: The Encore has a bigger, beefier, flat burr cousin, the Baratza Vario-W+ (7/10, WIRED Recommends) with a built-in scale and ridiculously granular adjustment (230 settings!). But like a lot of flat burrs, it struggles on finer grinds, according to WIRED contributor Joe Ray. And static is an issue. With price in play, the Ode Gen 2 comes out on top, but Ray was still a big fan of the Vario.\n\nFor travel and camping:\n\nVSSL Java manual grinder for $148: VSSL specializes in ultra-durable camping tools, and applied this same durable construction to this durable campsite-ready hand grinder that WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson attests to be rugged enough to survive the zombie apocalypse. The handle folds out to provide a lot of leverage while you grind, and you can use it as a hook to hang the device up when you're done.\n\nDmofwHi Cordless Grinder for $31: Going camping in the actual woods but don't feel like working too hard by hand-grinding to get a cup? Here you go. The DmofwHi grinder is a solid little blade grinder that's wireless and rechargeable (via USB-C), and you can grind enough coffee for about 15 to 18 pots of coffee on a single charge. It's a blade grinder, don't expect espresso. But for some roadside drip, Turkish or cowboy? Have fun.\n\nAlso Tested\n\nAarke Flat-Burr Grinder for $370: This pretty, shiny, stainless steel Aarke grinder contains a unique feature when paired with Aarke's coffee brewer, detecting the water in the brewer's tank and grinding the appropriate amount of beans. But this feature wasn't as calibrated as we'd like, and there have been a lot of online reports of grinder jams. I didn't have the same problem, but at more than $300 for a grinder that hasn't been long on the market, prudence is often rewarded.\n\nHario Skerton Pro for $50: The Hario Skerton was the gateway hand grinder for many a coffee nerd, but has since given ground to newer entrants. It's fast and cheap, but it'll give you a heck of a workout and isn't as consistent for coarse grinds, plus the silicone handle has a habit of falling off.\n\nHario Mini-Slim Plus for $37: This smaller Hario is not as fast as the Skerton, but its plastic construction makes it good to throw in a travel bag—and the low price is another reason you'll feel safe carting it around.\n\nCuisinart Burr Grinder for $60: At first, it seems like a good deal. It's Cuisinart, a known brand, and a conical burr grinder for less than $100! But former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey found that the low price came with a cost: These things burn out faster than a rock star in the late '60s.\n\nBodum Bistro Electric Blade Grinder for $20: This little blade grinder is quite cheap, and the model has served WIRED contributing reviewer Tyler Shane for years. That said, after some inconsistent reports on durability, we favor the KitchenAid as our budget pick.\n\nBreville Smart Grinder Pro for $200: WIRED has recommended this Breville in the past for its accessible burrs that make it easy to clean. But ever since Breville bought Baratza, they've slowly been swapping out the grinders in their excellent top-line semi-automatic espresso machines with those excellent Baratza burrs. For a standalone grinder, we give the same advice.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In 1974, the United States Congress passed the Privacy Act in response to public concerns over the US government’s runaway efforts to harness Americans’ personal data. Now Democrats in the US Senate are calling to amend the half-century-old law, citing ongoing attempts by billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to effectively commit the same offense—collusively collect untold quantities of personal data, drawing upon dozens if not hundreds of government systems.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen introduced the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025—a direct response, the lawmakers say, to the seizure by DOGE of computer systems containing vast tranches of sensitive personal information—moves that have notably coincided with the firings of hundreds of government officials charged with overseeing that data’s protection. “The seizure of millions of Americans’ sensitive information by Trump, Musk and other MAGA goons is plainly illegal,” Wyden tells WIRED, “but current remedies are too slow and need more teeth.”\n\nThe passage of the Privacy Act came in the wake of the McCarthy era—one of the darkest periods in American history, marked by unceasing ideological warfare and a government run amok, obsessed with constructing vast record systems to house files on hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations. Secret dossiers on private citizens were the primary tool for suppressing free speech, assembly, and opinion, fueling decades’ worth of sedition prosecutions, loyalty oaths, and deportation proceedings. Countless writers, artists, teachers, and attorneys saw their livelihoods destroyed, while civil servants were routinely rounded up and purged as part of the roving inquisitions.\n\nThe first privacy law aimed at truly reining in the power of the administrative state, the Privacy Act was passed during the dawn of the microprocessor revolution, amid an emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks and “automated personal data systems.” The explosion in advancements coincided with Cassandra-like fears among ordinary Americans about a rise in unchecked government surveillance through the use of “universal identifiers.”\n\nA wave of such controversies, including Watergate and COINTELPRO, had all but annihilated public trust in the government’s handling of personal data. “The Privacy Act was part of our country’s response to the FBI abusing its access to revealing sensitive records on the American people,” says Wyden. “Our bill defends against new threats to Americans’ privacy and the integrity of federal systems, and ensures individuals can go after the government when officials break the law, including quickly stopping their illegal actions with a court order.”\n\nThe bill, first obtained by WIRED last week, would implement several textual changes aimed at strengthening the law—redefining, for instance, common terms such as “record” and “process” to more aptly comport with their usage in the 21st century. It further takes aim at certain exemptions and provisions under the Privacy Act that have faced decades’ worth of criticism by leading privacy and civil liberties experts.\n\nWhile the Privacy Act generally forbids the disclosure of Americans’ private records except to the “individual to whom the records pertain,” there are currently at least 10 exceptions that apply to this rule. Private records may be disclosed, for example, without consent in the interest of national defense, to determine an individual’s suitability for federal employment, or to “prevent, control, or reduce crime.” But one exception has remained controversial from the very start. Known as “routine use,” it enables government agencies to disclose private records so long as the reason for doing so is “compatible” with the purpose behind their collection.",

        "content": "Over the weekend, thousands of people joined the “Tesla Takedown” protest movement at the company’s showrooms across the country. At the same time, a much smaller number of Elon Musk supporters turned out at Tesla locations for a counterprotest movement that some participants dubbed “Tesla Shield.”\n\nWhile the protest movement comprises people angered at Elon Musk’s role in the dismantling of federal government agencies, the counterprotest movement that showed up this weekend was peopled mostly by MAGA supporters. Among them were an array of far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys, armed militias, and at one event in Idaho, a guy dressed as Hitler.\n\nAs Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) rips through huge swaths of the federal government and puts people’s lives and livelihoods at risk, the Tesla protest movement has gained traction. Tesla’s stock price has dropped by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year. Isolated incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and chargers as well as dealerships have led Trump to push the Department of Justice to treat alleged violent protesters as “domestic terrorists,” and now some extremist groups have taken it upon themselves to help Musk fight back.\n\n“My people will be free, my people will rule again,” David Pettinger, a member of the extremist anti-government People’s Rights group, shouted at protesters in a fake German accent outside a Tesla dealership in Meridian, Idaho, on Saturday, according to video footage of the incident.\n\nA moustachioed Pettinger wore a T-shirt with the words “LITERALLY HITLER” written on the back and a picture of Musk giving a nazi-like salute on the front. Wearing jodhpurs and black boots, Pettinger marched in front of protesters and handed out heart-shaped stickers to Musk supporters.\n\nPettinger told WIRED that he dressed as Hitler to “make fun of the overuse of the terms nazi and fascist.” However, Pettinger’s posts on X echo Hitler’s deeply antisemitic worldview.\n\nAlso in Meridian were a number of armed individuals in camouflage gear, some wearing body armor, according to images of the counterprotest posted to Bluesky. Pettinger also appeared to be armed, according to video footage showing a handgun tucked into his jodhpurs.\n\nMeanwhile, Josh Fulfer, who is known online as Oreo Express and was at the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, joined a counterprotest group in Fresno, California, telling a local news outlet: “We’re out here to show support for DOGE, Elon Musk, Tesla, and this administration.” Fulfer can be seen on his own videos harassing and shouting at protesters.\n\nAhead of the Tesla Takedown protests this weekend, the Proud Boys and other far-right groups put out calls on their social media channels for supporters to show up in numbers and counter the protests.\n\nA virtually all of the dealerships which had protests this weekend, however, the number of anti-Musk protesters vastly outnumbered the pro-Musk protesters.",

        "title": "This Is How TAG Heuer Revamped Its Iconic F1 Watch",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Last month, a surreptitious early glimpse of TAG Heuer’s full-scale revival—officially revealed today—of its iconic plastic-cased 1980s watch, the “Formula 1,” appeared in the fitting setting of the Grand Prix racetrack.\n\nFor the 2025 F1 season, the watchmaker, appointed the sport’s official timekeeper under a mega-sponsorship deal inked by its parent company, luxury conglomerate LVMH, has installed an eye-catching clock tower above the pit lane. The clock’s dive-style dial, “Mercedes” hour hand, and notched, bright-red bezel were instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with the original multicolored Formula 1 watch—which launched in 1986 and sold in its millions—or with the limited remake that briefly appeared last year, as a collaboration with the US streetwear label Kith.\n\nEagle-eyed TAG Heuer super-buffs (of which there are plenty) will also have spotted details that suggested something new: bolder dial proportions, squarer numerals on the bezel, and the modern TAG Heuer logo.\n\nSure enough, this is the format for the new take on the old favorite, announced today as a full, entry-level addition to the watch brand’s product line-up—albeit, at 38 mm, somewhat bigger than the original (the old model was 35 mm). Subtle design enhancements are deployed to give it a more contemporary feel: applied luminous hour markers, crisper hands, and a sleeker, more angular interpretation of the old case-shape, with its “hooded” lug protuberances originally designed to reinforce the plastic casing around the strap attachment.\n\nThe new revamped TAG F1 is still colorful … Photograph: Aurélien Bergot … but the 35 mm case is now beefed up to 38 mm. Photograph: Aurélien Bergot\n\nA nod toward eco credentials comes in the form of bioplastic—a castor-based polyamide which the brand has named TH-Polylight—an on-trend substitute for the “Arnite” thermoplastic of old. As before, though, this is molded over a steel inner core, making for a watch that's rather more robust than most plastic-cased equivalents.\n\nThere are nine variants: three in sandblasted stainless steel with green, black, or blue polymer bezels and six full-color limited-editions to become available at upcoming Grand Prix races, with cases and bezels in contrasting tones, including yellow/black, red/black, and green/red, all with matching rubber straps.\n\nWhat the TAG spotters won’t have gleaned from the pit lane clock, however, is that the updated Formula 1, officially titled the TAG Heuer Formula 1 Solargraph, is also the latest step in TAG Heuer’s plan to elevate the prestige of solar power by making it the backbone of its entry-level offering.\n\nAs with certain models in TAG’s Aquaracer sports-watch category, the new piece contains the brand’s solar-powered TH-50 movement using tech from Citizen, the Japanese company, attached to a movement supplied by the latter’s Swiss subsidiary, La Joux-Perret. At $1,800 (£1,650), the Formula 1 Solargraph is more than $1,000 cheaper than the basic Aquaracer Solargraph, and now by some distance the most affordable watch in TAG Heuer’s lineup. Nevertheless, within the broader category of solar-powered watches it carries a significant Swiss Made premium (for equivalent functionality, Citizen’s own watches top out at around $600).\n\nTorsion testing on the new TAG F1 straps Photograph: Aurélien Bergot\n\nThe dial, consisting of two superposed polymer layers, allows light through to a solar cell beneath it, charging an accumulator storage unit that delivers energy to the movement. If left in darkness (in a drawer, for instance), a fully charged watch will continue to run for 10 months, an improvement on the six months originally claimed for the TH-50 movement (and also for Citizen’s own Eco Drive models). It can also be left in power-saving mode, with the crown pulled out to prevent the hands moving, for up to two and a half years, and takes just 10 seconds of light exposure to restart.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s notable that TAG Heuer—with its eyes firmly on the spending power of millions of Gen-Z consumers drawn to Formula 1’s mushrooming presence as a digital-first, Netflix-assisted pop-cultural phenomenon—continues to see electronic timekeeping as the gateway to its luxury watches. Like many brands, it has long used Swiss-made battery-powered movements for entry-level watches, but here the brand is attempting to position solar power as a modern, premium format, and a guarantee of the convenience and performance it says young buyers, in particular, are after.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Israeli historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari’s book Sapiens became an international bestseller by presenting a view of history driven by the fictions created by mankind. His later work Homo Deus then depicted the a future for mankind brought about by the emergence of superintelligence. His latest book, Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks From the Stone Age to AI, is a warning against the unparalleled threat of AI.\n\nA rising trend of techno-fascism driven by populism and artificial intelligence has been visible since the US presidential election in November. Nexus, which was published just a few months earlier, is a timely explainer of the potential consequences of AI on democracy and totalitarianism. In the book, Harari does not just sound the alarm on singularity—the hypothetical future point at which technology, particularly AI, moves beyond human control and advances irreversibly on its own—but also on AI’s foreignness.\n\nThis interview was conducted by Michiaki Matsushima, editor in chief of WIRED Japan, and was also recorded for “The Big Interview” YouTube series for the Japanese edition of WIRED, scheduled to be released in April 2025. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nPhotograph: Shintaro Yoshimatsu\n\nWIRED: In the late ’90s, when the internet began to spread, there was a discourse that this would bring about world peace. It was thought that with more information reaching more people, everyone would know the truth, mutual understanding would be born, and humanity would become wiser. WIRED, which has been a voice of change and hope in the digital age, was part of that thinking at the time. In your new book, Nexus, you write that such a view of information is too naive. Can you explain this?\n\nYUVAL NOAH HARARI: Information is not the same as truth. Most information is not an accurate representation of reality. The main role information plays is to connect many things, to connect people. Sometimes people are connected by truth, but often it is easier to use fiction or illusion.\n\nThe same is true of the natural world. Most of the information that exists in nature is not meant to tell the truth. We are told that the basic information underlying life is DNA, but is DNA true? No. DNA connects many cells together to make a body, but it does not tell us the truth about anything. Similarly, the Bible, one of the most important texts in human history, has connected millions of people together, but not necessarily by telling them the truth.\n\nWhen information is in a complete free market, the vast majority of information becomes fiction, illusion, or lies. This is because there are three main difficulties with truth.\n\nFirst of all, telling the truth is costly. On the other hand, creating fiction is inexpensive. If you want to write a truthful account of history, economics, physics, et cetera, you need to invest time, effort, and money in gathering evidence and fact-checking. With fiction, however, you can simply write whatever you want.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Santa Ana winds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron, synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”\n\nAt the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed. You’re doing, what, a cybercrime? my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain: No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.\n\nBy the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed in Altadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”\n\nLarson is a cofounder of OpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about C. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.\n\nUnfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a C. elegans worm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.\n\nSo much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.\n\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this: Uhh … why? Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?",

        "title": "Even More Venmo Accounts Tied to Trump Officials in Signal Group Chat Left Data Public",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "A number of top Trump administration officials—including four who were on a now-infamous Signal group chat—appear to have Venmo accounts that have been leaking data, including contacts and in some cases transactions, to the public. Experts say this is a potentially serious counterintelligence problem that could allow foreign intelligence services to gain insight into a target’s social network or even identify individuals who could be paid or coerced to act against them.\n\nThe officials in question include Dan Katz, chief of staff at the US Treasury; Joe Kent, President Trump’s nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to the secretary of state. All three were participants in the “Houthi PC small group” chat in which sensitive attack plans were discussed and to which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited. Katz was named in it as a point of contact by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary; Kent by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to whom Kent serves as acting chief of staff; and Needham by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.\n\nA fourth official with an open Venmo account—Brian McCormack, a senior staffer on the National Security Council—also appears to have been in the chat, in which a user with the screen name “Brian” lists McCormack as a point of contact for the NSC. His account went private after WIRED reached out to the NSC for comment. (“Mr. McCormack has made necessary Venmo updates for his personal privacy protection,” says NSC spokesperson James Hewitt.)\n\nMorgan Ortagus, a former Fox News personality and deputy to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, who was himself in the chat—also appears to have left Venmo data exposed.\n\nWIRED established that the accounts are almost certainly those of the government officials in question by analyzing the other accounts they were connected to, which in the cases of Katz, Kent, and Needham included accounts appearing to belong to their spouses. The Treasury Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome of the information revealed by the accounts is quite granular. McCormack and the accounts that appear to belong to Katz and Ortagus, for example, left not only their contact lists publicly visible but also their transactions, which are as recent as last autumn. These records reveal specific information like a 2018 payment from Katz with a note consisting solely of an eggplant emoji and how much he paid an overnight cat sitter in 2019. They also reveal McCormack’s contributions to what appears to be a get-together for veterans of the Bush-Cheney administration (“Cheney team reunion! Thank you!!”), who has reimbursed Ortagus for picnic expenses, and Kent’s connection to noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself “the secretary of retribution” and once created a deep state target list.\n\nWIRED has previously reported on the partially public Venmo accounts of several of the high-ranking officials in the Houthi PC chat, including Vice President JD Vance; Mike Waltz, the national security adviser; and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Waltz and Wiles set their accounts to private only after WIRED reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday afternoon.",

        "content": "After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal.\n\nBut the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news.\n\nIn other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers.\n\nElsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US.\n\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nTop US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online\n\nOn top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet.\n\nUsing people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials.",

        "content": "SignalGate, as it's come to be called, may be the biggest scandal to hit the Trump administration in its first months in power. But it's been great for Signal.\n\nSince the news broke on Monday that senior Trump administration cabinet members accidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a group chat on the Signal encrypted messaging platform where the officials were making secret plans to bomb Yemen, the ensuing news cycle and the constant mentions of Signal have led to the encrypted messaging platform doubling its usual rate of new downloads, the nonprofit organization that runs Signal tells WIRED. Given that 2025 has already been a “banner year” for Signal's growth, according to Signal's leadership, that makes this week the single biggest bump in US adoption of the app in Signal's nearly 11 years of existence.\n\n“In Signal’s history, this is the largest US-growth moment by a massive margin,” says Jun Harada, Signal's head of growth and partnerships. “It’s mind-blowing, even on our side.”\n\nHarada declined to give absolute numbers for Signal's user growth beyond saying that its total downloads are in the “hundreds of millions,” which has been the case for several years. But he said that the week’s rate of adoption has been twice that of a typical week for 2025, which in turn was twice that of a typical week the same time last year. “It happened immediately” after The Atlantic broke the story of Signal's use in the Yemeni bombing, Harada says. “And it’s been sustained. We’ve been maintaining that rate every day.”\n\nIn Signal's history, the only comparable spike in adoption occurred when WhatsApp changed its privacy policy in 2021, Harada says, leading to millions of users abandoning that communications app. But that incident mostly brought non-Americans to Signal, unlike the current, US-focused SignalGate bump.\n\nNumbers from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower largely align with Signal's own analysis of that growth: The company says that Signal downloads in the US increased 105 percent compared to the prior week—and 150 percent compared to an average week in 2024. Outside of the US, Sensor Tower saw only a 21 percent increase in Signal downloads compared to the prior week.\n\nThe Atlantic's revelation on Monday that secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz, vice president JD Vance, and other Trump administration officials used a Signal group chat to plan an air strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen—and that Waltz accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to that group in a shocking breach of confidentiality—has raised serious questions about the security practices of the Trump administration that are still resonating days later.\n\nThe scandal has called into question whether the executive branch officials were planning the air strike using vulnerable non-approved or even personal devices rather than the secure machines intended for classified conversations. Screenshots of the group chat published by The Atlantic on Wednesday indicate that the officials were using Signal's disappearing messages feature to delete their communications, potentially in violation of US record retention laws.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Organizers behind a pronatalist conference with far-right ties in Austin, Texas, this weekend have set up matchmaking events for attendees that include the option of getting married onsite as part of their greater effort to repopulate the world, WIRED has learned.\n\nAccording to its website, the sold-out Natal Conference, taking place March 28-29 at a hotel operated by the University of Texas at Austin, has “no political or ideological goal other than a world in which our children can have grandchildren.” But the event, an earlier version of which was promoted by Elon Musk, features speakers like Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Crémieux, an online pseudonym linked, according to The Guardian, to Jordan Lasker, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics.\n\nNatal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan, a father of at least six, according to Politico, has previously stated that eugenics—the belief that white people are genetically superior—and the pronatalist movement are “very much aligned.”\n\nPublicly available details about the Natal Conference are scant, with the vague online conference agenda promising closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates.\n\nGot a Tip? Do you have tips about the pronatalist movement or other internet culture stories? We'd like to hear from you. Contact senior culture editor Manisha Krishnan securely on Signal at mkrishnan.79 or email manisha_krishnan@wired.com.\n\nHowever, an email obtained by WIRED promoting a preconference mixer held Thursday night reveals matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference and in the pronatalist movement more widely.\n\n“This is a special email to NatalCon attendees who indicated they were highly interested in finding the missing puzzle piece for singles, matchmaking, marriage, and family formation,” reads the email, sent by an event producer named Luke, who did not sign with his last name.\n\n“We were stunned to receive many emails saying, ‘NatalCon needs to be focusing on this, right now!’ And we're here to serve you. This is coming from all sectors: singles, parents with dating-age children, grandparents, newlyweds that want to help their friends start families, and more,” the email said.\n\nAttendees are instructed to register to learn the exact venue (though it is listed elsewhere on the website), and registration was listed as costing $10,000 for the full weekend—an increase from earlier this year when the cost was 90 percent cheaper. (A Saturday-only ticket is $500.) Last year’s VIP package was $1,000, according to the NatalCon website. After credit card details are handed over, organizers vet potential attendees, requiring them to submit their social media handles. The website says prospective attendees aren’t charged unless they’re approved.\n\nNatalCon organizers, including Dolan, did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment.\n\nSingle registrants are directed to fill out a survey that asks their desired number of children (listing 1 to over 7 as options), “religious, spiritual, cultural, lifestyle” values, and whether they would be open to a “Q&A with a NatalCon speaker to introduce yourself to the room.”\n\nSpeaking to Edward Dutton—who has been described as a “proponent of pseudo-scientific ‘race science,’” by anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate—on a Jolly Heretic podcast in 2023, Dolan described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a “breeding program” for smart Mormons. He said his pronatalist events are a counter to the “perverse incentives in the dating app market.”",

        "title": "Startup Founder Claims Elon Musk Is Stealing the Name ‘Grok’",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s xAI is facing a potential trademark dispute over the name of its chatbot, Grok. The company’s trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office has been suspended after the agency argued the name could be confused with that of two other companies, AI chipmaker Groq and software provider Grokstream. Now, a third tech startup called Bizly is claiming it owns the rights to “Grok.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has chosen a name for one of his products that other companies say they trademarked first. Last month, Musk’s social media platform settled a lawsuit brought by a marketing firm that claimed it owns exclusive rights to the name X.\n\nBizly and xAI appear to have arrived at the name Grok independently. Bizly founder Ron Shah says he came up with it during a brainstorming session with a colleague who used the word as a verb. (The phrase “to grok” is frequently used in tech circles to mean “to understand.”) “I was like, that’s exactly the name,” Shah tells WIRED. “We got excited, high-fived, it was the name!”\n\nMusk has said he named his chatbot after a term used in the 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land, according to The Times of India. Author Robert A. Heinlein imagined “grok” as a word in a Martian lexicon that also meant “to understand.”\n\nShah says he applied to trademark the name Grok in 2021. Two years later, he was in the midst of launching an AI-powered app for asynchronous meetings called Grok when Musk announced his chatbot with the same name. “It was a day I’ll never forget,” Shah says. “I woke up and looked at my phone, and there were so many messages from friends saying ‘did you get acquired by Elon? Congrats!’ It was a complete shock to me.”\n\nShah insists xAI infringed on his trademark. But under US law, trademark regulations are primarily designed to protect consumers rather than companies, says Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, a law firm focused exclusively on trademarks. “The goal is to not have confusion as to who is behind a product or service,” he says.\n\nFor example, Musk’s former partner Grimes also trademarked the name Grok for a plushie AI-powered kids toy, but that application is very different from a software tool, reducing the likelihood of consumers getting them mixed up. “The details matter,” Gerben says. \"What does the original Grok do, and what does this new one do? Are they operating in the same channel of trade?”\n\nIn Bizly’s case, the answers to those questions are fairly murky. One of the requirements of registering a trademark is that owners need to demonstrate it is being used to sell goods or services in at least two states. The USPTO also allows people to file a trademark to reserve the rights to a name before a business is launched, but they can’t actually register it until, say, their jewelry website is fully up and running or their pizza parlor chain expands into a neighboring state.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nCities looking to eliminate fossil fuels in buildings have notched a decisive court victory. Last week, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by plumbing and building trade groups against a New York City ban on natural gas in new buildings. The decision is the first to explicitly disagree with a previous ruling that struck down Berkeley, California’s first-in-the-nation gas ban. That order, issued by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 and upheld again last year, prompted cities across the country to withdraw or delay laws modeled after the Berkeley ordinance.\n\nWhile New York City’s law functions differently from Berkeley’s, legal experts say that this month’s decision provides strong legal footing for all types of local policies to phase out gas in buildings—and could encourage cities to once again take ambitious action.\n\n“It’s a clear win in that regard, because the 9th Circuit decision has had a really chilling effect on local governments,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Now there’s something else to point to, and a good reason for hope for local governments that may have back-burnered their building electrification plans to bring those to the forefront again.”\n\nIn 2021, New York City adopted Local Law 154, which sets an air emissions limit for indoor combustion of fuels within new buildings. Under the law, the burning of “any substance that emits 25 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy” is prohibited. That standard effectively bans gas-burning stoves, furnaces, and water heaters, and any other fossil-fuel powered appliances. Instead, real estate developers have to install electric appliances, like induction stoves and heat pumps. The policy went into effect in 2024 for buildings under seven stories, and will apply to taller buildings starting in 2027.\n\nBerkeley’s law, on the other hand, banned the installation of gas piping in new construction. The first-of-its-kind policy was passed in 2019 and inspired nearly a hundred local governments across the country to introduce similar laws. But the ordinance quickly faced a lawsuit by the California Restaurant Association, which argued that gas stoves were essential for the food service industry. In April 2023, the 9th Circuit court ruled in favor of the restaurant industry, holding that federal energy efficiency standards preempted Berkeley’s policy. In January 2024, a petition by the city of Berkeley to rehear the case on the 9th Circuit was denied.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "As a child, beloved Japanese game developer Keita Takahashi was picked on in school, so he never felt like going. His latest game, To a T, emulates some of those challenges. It tells the story of Teen—a kid struggling to fit in, dealing with eye boogers, and finding themselves through song and exploration, all while their arms are inexplicably stuck in a T-pose.\n\nTo a T, to be released by Annapurna Interactive May 28, follows Takahashi’s trajectory of creating colorful, playful games that are undeniably cute but incredibly odd. His best-known game, Katamari Damacy, is about rolling up everything in sight, from pens to people, in an ever-growing ball, featuring an unforgettable soundtrack and the most flamboyant king to ever grace games. Others, like 2019’s Wattam, are eccentric, vibrant, and full of poop.\n\nCreated with the game studio Uvula, To a T follows Teen’s struggles navigating the bathroom, getting dressed, and dealing with bullies as their arms are trapped in a T. Fortunately Teen’s dog, a shockingly adept creature who puts modern service dogs to shame, is there to help whenever Teen needs an extra set of movable hands. (Annapurna Interactive aptly describes Teen’s furry helper as being “a very cute dog.”)\n\nThe episodic tale opens with an upbeat song about the game (not to be confused with “The Giraffe Song,” sung in a teaser video by Rebecca Sugar). During a brief demo I played, I guided Teen through washing their face, picking outfits, and getting ready for school.\n\nHoping for some deeper insights into the game, I tracked down Takahashi at an Xbox event in San Francisco during GDC, where he was hiding in a back corner away from the bustle of the day and the bar. But, while he's loath to answer too many questions about his game and what it all means, he’ll still gamely, gently troll anyone who comes his way.\n\nBelow is an abbreviated version of a very puzzling interview.\n\nWIRED: Tell me a little bit about what is, generally, going on in this game.\n\nKeita Takahashi: [Laughs] What’s generally going on with this game?\n\nWe’ll start there.\n\nIt’s a game about a teenager who’s stuck as a T-pose and trying to figure out where the T-pose is coming from. It’s a game about—umm. [Long pause] Do I need to explain? [Another long pause] No. [Laughs]\n\nThat’s fair. Who is this character? How would you describe them?\n\nA teenager, 13-years-old, female or male, whatever I mean, I don’t care—stuck in a T-pose, for some reason.\n\nWhat makes T the perfect pose?\n\nBecause it’s perfect! You are perfect. I think it’s just perfect.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest thing to do when you’re T-posed is?\n\nGo to the bathroom. That’s why the dog helps [with] everything. Changing the clothing, bathroom, washing your face.\n\nI’ve never played a game that had me start by going to the bathroom.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Top career officials at the Department of the Interior (DOI) were placed on administrative leave late last week after declining to immediately give affiliates of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) levels of access to a payroll system that would in theory allow them to, among other things, stop individual Supreme Court justices’ paychecks.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that these officials include the DOI’s chief information and information security officers; sources tell WIRED they also include a top lawyer.\n\nFor several weeks, say sources with direct knowledge of the situation, DOGE operatives have been seeking what they termed “full” or “system” access to the DOI’s payroll, human resources, and credentialing systems. Among the systems to which it demanded full access is the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS), which is housed in the DOI’s Interior Business Center and is used by dozens of federal agencies ranging from the Department of Justice to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to handle payroll and records associated with more than 275,000 federal workers, including at agencies outside the executive branch.\n\nThe DOGE associates in question are Tyler Hassen, an energy executive and acting assistant secretary of policy, management, and budget at DOI; Stephanie Holmes, who runs HR for DOGE and is the acting chief human capital officer at DOI; and Katrine Trampe, an adviser to Doug Burgum, the secretary of the interior.\n\nAccording to sources with direct knowledge, when asked why they sought full access to these systems, the DOGE operatives said they specifically sought levels of permissions that would give them the ability to create, pause, and delete email accounts. This functionality doesn’t, strictly speaking, exist for any one user within the systems they were seeking to access, because such actions are, as a security measure, designed to be initiated by one person and approved by another. Granting their request would thus require them each to be given an essentially God-mode level of access to the entire system architecture.\n\nAccording to sources and a risk assessment memorandum reviewed by WIRED and first reported on by the Times, top career officials saw several issues with granting these unprecedented levels of access.\n\nFirst, it raised an inherent security issue. No single person at DOI has root-level permissions to all the systems the DOGE operatives sought to access, which could allow them—or an outside actor who had compromised their credentials—to do anything from overwrite the code base to look at the W2s and other personal information of, or even stop payments to, individual federal workers. (According to one source, who cited The Atlantic’s recent reporting on top national security officials sharing sensitive military information in a Signal chat, a specific concern raised within the Department of the Interior was that DOGE affiliates might share the credentials in an insecure way, leading to a breach on par with the hack of the Office of Personnel Management a decade ago, in which tens of millions of federal personnel records were accessed by hackers linked to the Chinese government.)",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Since the first days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been everywhere in the federal government, moving fast and breaking things. In a matter of weeks, DOGE operatives have spread across dozens of government agencies as they have attempted to terminate tens of thousands of federal employees. With so much focus on where DOGE is going, WIRED wanted to take a beat to look at where they’ve come from and what that might tell us about how they’re thinking about reshaping the federal government.\n\nThe big takeaway: Many on the DOGE team are from Musk’s world. If Musk is America’s CEO, then DOGE has become his Silicon Valley executive branch.\n\nWe’ve mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they’ve been connected to. Readers can check that out, and click through it, below. We plan to keep updating this as we find more DOGE operatives or as known affiliates move to new agencies.\n\nWe’re focused on the new people brought in under the second Trump administration or directly hired into agencies—as Special Government Employees (SGEs) or regular employees—who are operating as members of DOGE teams. This gets a little tricky because there are technically two DOGEs established under the president’s executive order. There’s the US DOGE Service (USDS), formerly the US Digital Service, that’s a permanent organization. Then there’s the temporary USDS organization, which wraps up on July 4, 2026, and through which SGEs can be hired.\n\nHere’s what we’ve learned:\n\nThe DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them). In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. The two of them have been Musk’s guides to DC.\n\nIn that second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively. Jacob Altik, another conservative lawyer on the DOGE squad, has been selected to clerk for Gorsuch. Jeremy Lewin, who was part of DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with Second Lady Usha Vance’s former law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that has also represented Tesla.\n\nThen, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE’s ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk. Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies. There are the obvious people like Steve Davis, president of Musk’s Boring Company, who have followed Musk across his various ventures. (Davis previously worked at SpaceX and assisted Musk in his overhaul of X, formerly Twitter.) Davis spearheaded the DOGE recruitment efforts before inauguration day and has continued to play a pivotal role in the organization. Similarly, SpaceX employee Brian Bjelde, who is now at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), also helped Musk downsize Twitter’s staff in 2022.\n\nThere are people like many of the young engineers WIRED first identified who were given the keys to different government agencies, like Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine, who were all interns or employees at one of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, and Neuralink. (Musk has been involved in others, but these are the ones he controls.)",

        "content": "Last week, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney declared that the “old relationship” his country had with the United States was “over,” and it’s “clear the US is no longer a reliable partner.” Carney’s comments came after the US announced sweeping new tariffs on Canada and President Donald Trump spent months making inflammatory comments that have alarmed Canada’s leaders, including suggestions that the country would be “better off” if it was annexed by the US. Tensions finally boiled over last Wednesday when Trump said he will impose 25 percent tariffs on foreign-made cars, a move that could have a major negative economic impact on Canada—once one of America’s staunchest allies.\n\nAmong Canadians in Silicon Valley, the rift between the two nations is sparking a new kind of national pride, as well as a lot of uncertainty. For now, at least, Trump’s tariffs on Canada don’t extend to software, so the flow of digital goods and services between the two countries remains mostly uninterrupted. But the chaos has prompted some prominent founders and investors to urge young Canadians to build companies at home and strengthen the local tech ecosystem, while Canadian tech companies with large operations in the US are wondering if they need to change strategies, or even headquarters.\n\n“I think the biggest thing happening right now is that Canadian founders are having to adjust to a new reality in which two fundamental assumptions we've taken for granted for decades can no longer be counted on,” says Chris Neumann, a Vancouver-based venture capitalist and former startup founder. “Namely, that the US is a reliable trading partner and that the US and Canada have a stable, mutually beneficial free-trade agreement.\"\n\nAt the same time, some Canadians tell WIRED that the social and financial capital of Silicon Valley remain huge draws for tech workers. Many ambitious entrepreneurs would still jump at the chance to join the Y Combinator tech accelerator in the US, for example, “whether they’re coming from Canada or coming from Argentina,” says Michael Buhr, the executive director of C100, a nonprofit networking group for Canadians in Silicon Valley.\n\n“I like to joke that you can’t put a tariff on talent,” Brandon Waselnuk, an executive at the documentation app Mintlify, said at an event in California last week.\n\nWaselnuk is originally from Ottawa but now lives and works in San Francisco. Back in January, he put out a call on social media to find other Canadians in tech who, like him, might be feeling unsettled by rising tensions between the US and their home country. A number of Canadians got in touch, and Waselnuk began organizing local events for what he dubbed the “Maple Syrup Gang.” The first outing was a city rucking and chocolate tasting excursion co-led by his wife.\n\nWaselnuk hosted last week’s gathering at the sleek offices of Bain Capital in downtown San Francisco. Around 60 entrepreneurs and venture capitalists from Canada gathered to watch startup demos while noshing on pizza and poutine. Greeting people near the entrance, Waselnuk appeared quintessentially Canadian, both in terms of affability and attire. He wore a hat emblazoned with what he explained was the logo for Trans Canada Trail. His red maple-leaf T-shirt, however, required no explaining.",

        "title": "DOGE Plans to Rebuild SSA Code Base in Months, Risking Benefits and System Collapse",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.\n\nThe project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.\n\nUnder any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.\n\n“Of course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.\n\nThe Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.\n\nSSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.\n\nThis proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.\n\nLike many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration’s DEI purge of military acknowledgements.)\n\nAs recently as 2016, SSA’s infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General found. In fact, SSA’s core programmatic systems and architecture haven’t been “substantially” updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler, according to SSA’s 2017 modernization plan.",

        "content": "Apple’s software design strives to be intuitive, but each iteration of iOS contains so many additions and tweaks that it's easy to miss some useful iPhone settings. Apple focused on artificial intelligence when it unveiled iOS 18 in 2024, but there's a lot under the hood that adds to the steady stream of intriguing customizations and lesser-known features from the last few years. Several helpful settings are turned off by default, and it's not immediately obvious how to switch off some annoying features. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Apple phone.\n\nOnce you have things set up the way you want, it’s a breeze to copy everything, including settings, when you switch to a new iPhone. For more tips and recommendations, read our related guides—Best iPhone, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best MagSafe Accessories—and our explainers on How to Set Up a New iPhone, How to Back Up Your iPhone, and How to Fix Your iPhone.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just $2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\n\nHow to Keep Your iPhone Updated These settings are based on the latest version of iOS 18, and should be applicable for most recent iPhones. Some settings may not be available on older devices or they may have different pathways depending on the model and the software version. Apple offers excellent software support for many years, so always make sure your device is up-to-date by heading to Settings > General > Software update. You can find the Settings app on your home screen.\n\nCustomize the Control Center\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nSwipe down from the top right of the screen to open the Control Center, and you’ll see it's more customizable than ever. You can tap the plus icon at the top left or tap and hold on an empty space to open the customization menu. Here you can move icons and widgets around, remove anything you don’t want, or tap Add a Control at the bottom for a searchable list of shortcut icons and widgets you can organize across multiple Control Center screens. You can also customize your home screen with iOS 18 to change the color and size of app icons, rearrange them, and more.\n\nChange Your Lock Screen Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 5 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Parker Hall Screenshot\n\nYou know those lock screen controls that default to flashlight on the bottom left and camera on the bottom right? You can change them. Press and hold on an empty space on the lock screen and tap Customize, then Lock Screen. Tap the minus icon to remove an existing shortcut, and tap the plus icon to add a new one. You can also change the weather and date widgets, the font and color for the time, and pick a wallpaper.\n\nExtend Screen Time-Out\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nWhile it’s good to have your screen time out for battery saving and security purposes, I find it maddening when the screen goes off while I’m doing something. The default screen time-out is too short in my opinion, but thankfully, you can adjust it. Head into Settings, Display & Brightness, and select Auto-Lock to extend it. You have several options, including Never, which means you will have to manually push the power button to turn the screen off.\n\nTurn Off Keyboard Sounds\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nThe iPhone’s keyboard clicking sound when you type is extremely aggravating. Trust me, even if you don’t hate it, everyone in your vicinity when you type sure does. You can turn it off in Settings, Sound & Haptics by tapping Keyboard Feedback and toggling Sound off. I also advise toggling off the Lock Sound while you’re in Sound & Haptics.\n\nGo Dark\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nProtect yourself from eye-searing glare with dark mode. Go to Settings, pick Display & Brightness, and tap Dark. You may prefer to toggle on Automatic and have it change with the sun setting, but I prefer to be in Dark mode all the time.\n\nChange Your Battery Charge Level\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nIf you’re determined to squeeze as many years out of your iPhone battery as possible, consider changing the charging limit. You can maximize your smartphone's battery health if you avoid charging it beyond 80 percent. The iPhone’s default is now Optimized Battery Charging, which waits at 80 percent and then aims to hit 100 percent when you are ready to go in the morning. But there’s a slider you can set to a hard 80 percent limit in Settings, under Battery, and Charging.\n\nSet Up the Action Button\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill 20-Setting_Action Button 1_Photo SOURCE Simon Hill Screenshot\n\nFolks with an iPhone 15 Pro model or any device in the iPhone 16 range have an Action Button instead of the old mute switch. By default, it will silence your iPhone when you press and hold it, but you can change what it does by going to Settings, then Action Button. You can swipe through various basic options from Camera and Flashlight to Visual Intelligence, but select Shortcuts if you want it to do something more interesting. If you’re unfamiliar, check out our guide on How to Use the Apple Shortcuts App.\n\nTurn Off Apple Intelligence\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nMuch vaunted but slightly underwhelming, Apple Intelligence isn’t fully baked yet, and we are still waiting for an improved Siri. If you prefer to opt out of certain features or opt out completely, go to Settings, Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap on it to toggle Apple Intelligence off. If you prefer to keep select features on, you can find instructions in our How to Turn off Apple Intelligence guide.\n\nHide Sensitive Apps\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nWhether you are embarrassed by your Candy Crush addiction or risque photos, or perhaps you’ve been using the Notes app to plan your partner’s birthday party, you can hide them from prying eyes. I'm not here to judge. To protect an app, you have two options: tap and hold on the icon and select Require Face ID, then Require Face ID or Hide and Require Face ID. The first option leaves the app in place, but no one can access it without a Face ID check. If you prefer to hide the app, choose the second option and then Hide App, and it will be obscured inside a Hidden folder at the bottom of your App Library that requires a Face ID check to open.\n\nStop Videos Autoplaying or Looping\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nIf you find it irritating that videos automatically play as you scroll through the Photos app, or it bugs you that they loop and repeat instead of stopping at the end, you can change that behavior. Tap Settings, Apps, then Photos, and scroll down to toggle Auto-Play Motion and Loop Videos off.\n\nEnhance Speech in Movies and TV Shows\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nIt can be tough to make out the dialog in some TV shows and movies, but Apple has a fix for muffled speech on your iPhone. When you’re playing a video, tap the screen to bring up the menu and select the audio icon. You can select Enhance Dialogue and choose Enhance or Enhance More to make the voices louder and clearer.\n\nSet Up Do Not Disturb\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot\n\nAt an absolute minimum, you should shut up your iPhone at night so it doesn’t disturb your sleep, but Apple offers a wide range of tools to automate or schedule downtime to help you focus. Go to Settings, Focus, and choose Do Not Disturb to get started. You can turn off notifications but set up exceptions so that specific contacts or apps will get through. You can also go to Screen Time and Downtime to set a specific schedule for each day.\n\nChange Your Default Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot\n\nYou don’t have to use Safari as your browser or Apple’s Mail app for emails. You can change the default apps on your iPhone by going to Settings, Apps, and Default Apps. If you have valid alternative apps installed for Email, Messaging, Browser, and a few other categories, you can select them instead of Apple’s apps.\n\nKeep iCloud Files Local\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nYou can choose to keep certain files that you have synced with iCloud stored locally on your iPhone, which is handy if you want to access them when there’s no internet available. Open the Files app, go to the Browse tab, and choose iCloud Drive. You can tap and hold on any folder or file and select Keep Downloaded to keep a copy on your iPhone.\n\nLimit App Permissions\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nIt’s worth reviewing your app permissions and limiting them. There are a few routes to do this, but Settings, then Privacy & Security, might be the easiest. There’s a lot here, but I advise looking at Location Services and removing or reducing permissions for apps you don’t think need them. You can toggle off Precise Location for many, since an approximate location is often enough for them to function the way you want. Other apps to keep an eye on are Contacts and Photos, as both now give you the option to allow limited access.\n\nBy the way, if you want to turn off Background App Refresh to stop apps sucking down data and draining the battery when you aren’t using them, go to Settings, Apps, and choose any you don’t need to refresh unless you open them to toggle it off.\n\nChange Siri’s Voice\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nApple offers a whole range of voices for Siri now. Go to Settings, choose Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap Voice to see a list of variations (American, Australian, British, Indian, Irish, South African) and voices (Irish Voice 2 is my pick). Just be aware that if you choose a new one, it may take a while to download.\n\nSet a Shortcut for Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 5 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot\n\nForget about typing out your whole email address every time. Go to Settings, General, and choose Keyboard. Tap Text Replacement and then the plus icon at the top right to set up text shortcuts, such as “eml” for your full email address, or “addy” for your mailing address. This can also work for any other text you type out frequently.\n\nShow Notifications on Lock Screen\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nApple is all about privacy, but having to unlock your iPhone to see the content of an incoming message can be annoying. You can change how this works by going to Settings, Notifications, and selecting Show Previews. It is set to When Unlocked by default, but you can choose Always or Never.\n\nMake Some AI Art\n\nScreenshots courtesy of Simon Hill\n\nIf you decide to give AI a chance and fancy generating some art with AI assistance, open up the Playground app. You can pick photos, themes, costumes, accessories, places, or type prompts. Here’s a full guide on how to use Apple’s Image Playground. It's available on Apple devices running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2.\n\nReduce Car Sickness\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Screenshot courtesy of Simon Hill Screenshot\n\nDo you get nauseous when you use your iPhone as a car passenger? Go to Settings, Accessibility, choose Motion, then Show Vehicle Motion Cues. You can turn it on or off to display dots that help reduce motion sickness, but if you tap Automatic, it will turn on when it detects you are in the car.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of explicit AI-generated images, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material, were left open and accessible to anyone on the internet, according to new research seen by WIRED. An open database belonging to an AI image-generation firm contained more than 95,000 records, including some prompt data and images of celebrities such as Ariana Grande, the Kardashians, and Beyoncé de-aged to look like children.\n\nThe exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.\n\nThe exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.\n\n“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”\n\nFowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.\n\nNeither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.\n\n“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”\n\nBefore it was wiped, GenNomis listed multiple different AI tools on its homepage. These included an image generator allowing people to enter prompts of images they want to create, or upload an image and include a prompt to alter it. There was also a face-swapping tool, a background remover, plus an option to turn videos into images.\n\n“The most disturbing thing, obviously, was the child explicit images and seeing ones that were clearly celebrities reimagined as children,” Fowler says. The researcher explains that there were also AI-generated images of fully clothed young girls. He says in those instances, it is unclear whether the faces used are completely AI-generated or based on real images.",

        "title": "Sperm Stem Cells Were Used for the First Time in an Attempt to Restore Fertility",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Jaiwen Hsu was an active 11-year-old when he developed pain in his left knee that forced him to sit out a few soccer games. What his parents thought was a sports injury turned out to be osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.\n\nHe started chemotherapy, which doctors warned could result in infertility. Hsu hadn’t reached puberty yet, so sperm banking wasn’t an option. His parents enrolled him in a study that was collecting and storing immature testicular tissue, and the sperm-forming stem cells in them, from young patients with the goal of eventually giving them a way to have biological children.\n\nNow 26, Hsu and his doctors are waiting to see if an experimental transplant of these cells, extracted from a tissue sample taken back in 2011, will be able to restart sperm production. The procedure has been successful in mice and monkeys, but researchers say Hsu was the first person to undergo it in November 2023. The technique is detailed in a new paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\n“As an 11-year-old, I don’t think I could quite understand the severity of having a cancer diagnosis or comprehend the idea of starting a family down the road and how important that would be,” Hsu tells WIRED.\n\nIn the early stages of his cancer treatment, Hsu and his family traveled from their home in Maryland to UPMC Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where doctors collected a piece of testicular tissue containing the precious sperm stem cells. These stem cells are present even before puberty. During puberty, rising testosterone levels signal to these cells to develop into sperm, a process known as spermatogenesis.\n\nIn November 2023, at age 24, Hsu was reunited with those cells. After undergoing anesthesia, he received an injection of them into one of his testes. The hope is that the cells engraft into the spaghetti-like tubules of the testis and develop into mature sperm.\n\n“If it works, those stem cells should regenerate spermatogenesis,” says Kyle Orwig, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the senior author on the new study. Even if it kick-starts sperm production, it might not be enough to come out in the ejaculate. “If there are, there definitely would not be enough sperm to restore natural fertility,” Orwig says.\n\nIn animals, it’s possible to remove a larger piece of testicular tissue, which yields more stem cells and more sperm. But in children undergoing cancer treatment, it’s important to minimize harm—and recovery time—so only a small amount of tissue is taken. That results in a relatively small number of stem cells.\n\nFor that reason, Hsu will likely still need assistive reproductive technology if he wants to start a family. He’s not at that point yet, but he said he chose to undergo the procedure now, in his mid-twenties, because “it gives us a good time cushion to see if this works.”\n\nIn the future, surgeons would likely need to cut into his testis and extract any sperm that might be there, which would then be used to fertilize an egg in a laboratory. Until Hsu is ready to have a child, researchers probably won’t know if the procedure worked.",

        "title": "Sam Altman Says OpenAI Will Release an ‘Open Weight’ AI Model This Summer",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Sam Altman today revealed that OpenAI will release an open-weight artificial intelligence model in the coming months.\n\n“We are excited to release a powerful new open-weight language model with reasoning in the coming months,” the CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe move is partly a response to the runaway success of the R1 model from Chinese company DeepSeek, as well as the popularity of Meta’s Llama models.\n\nShortly after DeepSeek’s model was released in January, Altman said that OpenAI was “on the wrong side of history” regarding open models, signaling a likely shift in direction. On Monday he said that the company has been thinking about releasing an open-weight model for some time, adding “now it feels important to do.”\n\nOpenAI may feel the need to show that it can train the new model cheaply, since DeepSeek’s model was purportedly trained at a fraction of the cost of most large AI models.\n\n“This is amazing news,” Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace, a company that specializes in hosting open AI models, told WIRED. “With DeepSeek, everyone’s realizing the power of open weights.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nOpenAI currently makes its AI available through a chatbot and through the cloud. R1, Llama and other open-weight models can be downloaded for free and modified. A model’s weights refers to the values inside a large neural network—something that is set during training. Open-weight models are cheaper to use and can also be tailored for sensitive use cases, like handling highly confidential information.\n\nSteven Heidel, a member of the technical staff at OpenAI, reposted Altman’s announcement and added, “We're releasing a model this year that you can run on your own hardware.”\n\nJohannes Heidecke, a researcher working on AI safety at OpenAI, also reposted the message on X, adding that the company would conduct rigorous testing to ensure the open-weight model could not easily be misused. Some AI researchers worry that open-weight models could help criminals launch cyberattacks or even develop biological or chemical weapons. “While open models bring unique challenges, we’re guided by our Preparedness Framework and will not release models we believe pose catastrophic risks,” Heidecke wrote.\n\nOpenAI today also posted a webpage inviting developers to apply for early access to the forthcoming model. Altman said in his post that the company would host events for developers with early prototypes of the new model in the coming weeks.\n\nMeta was the first major AI company to pursue a more open approach, releasing the first version of Llama in July 2023. A growing number of open-weight AI models are now available. Some researchers note that Llama and some other models are not as transparent as they could be, because the training data and other details are still kept secret. Meta also imposes a license that limits other companies’ ability to profit from applications and tools built using Llama.\n\nUpdate March 31, 2025, 4:21 EST: This article was updated with a comment from Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The DOGE-affiliated acting president of the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally funded, independent think tank, has moved to transfer the agency’s $500 million headquarters building to the General Services Administration free of charge, according to court documents revealed in a recently filed lawsuit.\n\nTensions at USIP have been escalating for weeks, starting when the Trump administration fired the agency’s 10 voting board members on March 14 and USIP staffers denied DOGE representatives access at the front door. Three days later, DOGE employees made their way into the building, reportedly using a physical key from a former security contractor. The dramatic confrontations culminated in a full takeover, with former State Department official Kenneth Jackson assuming the role of president. As of this past Friday, most USIP staffers have received termination notices.\n\nFormer USIP officials have since filed a lawsuit against Jackson, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the Trump administration, seeking an immediate intervention “to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute,” according to the complaint. While US district judge Beryl Howell declined the USIP request for a temporary restraining order that would reinstate the institute’s board on March 19, she sharply criticized DOGE’s conquest in court.\n\nCourt documents filed by defendants on Monday reveal the next phase of DOGE’s plans for USIP. As of March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh—formerly installed at GSA—has replaced Jackson as the institute’s acting president, the documents show. They further state that Cavanaugh has been instructed to transfer USIP’s assets—including its real estate—to the GSA. The letter detailing those changes and instructions was signed by secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.\n\nCavanaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The lead attorney for the Department of Justice in this case also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a separate undated letter, which was also included in the batch of documents filed with the court, Cavanaugh writes to GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian: “I have concluded that it is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States for USIP to transfer its real property located at 2301 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, to GSA and to seek an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement for the building.”\n\nCavanaugh goes on to estimate that the building has a “fair market value” of $500 million.\n\nIn another letter included in the lawsuit’s docket dated March 29, Project 2025 architect and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought writes to Ehikian to approve his request “to set the amount of reimbursement at no cost for the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace’s (USIP) headquarters building.”\n\nTo state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency, installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64.\n\n“The effort to transfer the building to GSA is part of the DOGE playbook to run agencies through a wood chipper. That’s what they’re trying to do,” claims George Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP. “They’re trying to kill the agency, which they have no right to do.”\n\nLawyers for the former USIP staff filed a motion Monday to prevent the transfer of assets. In an opposing court filing, government lawyers claim that “the Institute is an executive agency and has decided consistent with the Executive Order and its statutory authority to transfer its excess property to GSA,” referring to president Donald Trump's February EO that purportedly “reins in independent agencies.”\n\nJudge Howell will decide whether to allow the transfer in court Tuesday; a broader ruling in the USIP case is expected by the end of the month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Giles.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI has acquired his social media platform X in an all-stock transaction that values the company at $33 billion, including $12 billion worth of debt, the centibillionaire announced Friday. The sale comes just weeks after Musk reportedly raised an additional roughly $1 billion in debt financing for X that valued the company at $44 billion—the same price Musk paid for it three years ago.\n\n“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in an X post. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”\n\nBoth Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and Igor Babuschkin, the cofounder of xAI, immediately posted similar messages on X signaling their support of the acquisition. “The future could not be brighter,” Yaccarino wrote. Musk only reposted Babuschkin’s.\n\nIt is not known whether Yaccarino will stay in the same role or what the acquisition will mean for X's employees. Musk, Yaccarino, and Robert Keele, the head of xAI’s legal team, did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.\n\nMusk bought Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it X in a deal that involved taking out billions of dollars in loans from a group of Wall Street banks and other lenders. After Musk took over and X’s advertising business slumped, the banks reportedly struggled to unload the loans to interested buyers. Lenders typically try to resell debt to other investors quickly to get it off their balance sheets and profit from associated fees. The Wall Street Journal dubbed the fiasco “the worst buyout for banks since the financial crisis.”\n\nBut X’s financial situation turned around after Donald Trump was reelected and Musk was appointed to run the administration’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. More investors became interested in the debt as advertisers began returning and Musk’s ties to the White House and Trump deepened.\n\nMusk also said he gave X investors a 25 percent stake in xAI last year, which helped boost the value of the social media platform and provide more security to lenders, according to reporting from the Financial Times.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former X employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87.\n\nWhile xAI previously appeared to be mostly playing catch-up with rivals like OpenAI and Google, Musk gave the startup a boost by creating a massive cluster of 100,000 GPUs, enough computing resources to compete with the biggest industry players. The supercomputer, dubbed Colossus, is located in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nAt the outset, xAI’s stated mission was to understand the nature of the universe. Today, it is best known for creating an “unfiltered” chatbot called Grok, which has been integrated as part of the X platform since late 2023.",

        "title": "Amazon’s AGI Lab Reveals Its First Work: Advanced AI Agents",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Amazon is still seen as a bit of a laggard in the race to develop advanced artificial intelligence, but it has quietly created a lab that is now setting records when it comes to AI performance. Amazon’s AGI SF Lab, which is located in San Francisco and dedicated to building artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses the capabilities of humans, revealed the first fruits of its work today: A new AI model capable of powering some of the most advanced AI agents available anywhere.\n\nThe new model, called Amazon Nova Act, outperforms ones from OpenAI and Anthropic on several benchmarks designed to gauge the intelligence and aptitude of AI agents, Amazon says. On the benchmarks GroundUI Web and ScreenSpot, Amazon Nova Act performs better than Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI Computer Use Agent. A major part of Amazon’s plan to compete in the AI market is to focus on building agents, and the new model’s abilities reflect its efforts to build a generation of tools that can measure up to the very best available.\n\n“I believe that the basic atomic unit of computing in the future is going to be a call to a giant [AI] agent,” says David Luan, who leads Amazon’s AGI SF Lab. He was previously a vice president of engineering at OpenAI and later cofounded Adept, a startup that pioneered work on AI agents, before joining Amazon in 2024 when the ecommerce giant took a stake in the company.\n\nMost of the leading AI labs are now focused on building increasingly capable AI agents. Getting AI to master independent actions, as well as conversation, promises to make the technology more useful and valuable. The shift from chat to action is still very much a work in progress, however.\n\nIn the past six months, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others have demonstrated web-browsing agents that take actions in response to a prompt. But for the most part, these agents are still unreliable, and they can easily be tripped up by open-ended requests.\n\nLuan says that Amazon’s goal is building AI agents that are dependable rather than flashy. The thing holding agents back is not the need for “more cool demos of interesting capabilities that work 60 percent of the time, it’s the Waymo problem,” he says, referring to how self-driving cars needed to be trained to deal with unusual edge cases before they could take to the streets unsupervised.\n\nMany so-called agents are built by combining large language models with multiple human-written rules that are designed to prevent them from veering off course, but also makes their behavior brittle. Amazon Nova Act is a version of the company's most powerful homegrown model Amazon Nova that has received additional training to help it make decisions about what actions to take and at what time. In general, Luan says, AI models struggle to decide when they should intervene in a task.\n\nTo improve Nova’s agential abilities, Amazon is using reinforcement learning, a method that has helped other AI models better simulate reasoning.",

        "title": "Inside arXiv—the Most Transformative Platform in All of Science",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” With a sly grin that I’d soon come to recognize, Paul Ginsparg quoted Michael Corleone from The Godfather. Ginsparg, a physics professor at Cornell University and a certified MacArthur genius, may have little in common with Al Pacino’s mafia don, but both are united by the feeling that they were denied a graceful exit from what they’ve built.\n\nNearly 35 years ago, Ginsparg created arXiv, a digital repository where researchers could share their latest findings—before those findings had been systematically reviewed or verified. Visit arXiv.org today (it’s pronounced like “archive”) and you’ll still see its old-school Web 1.0 design, featuring a red banner and the seal of Cornell University, the platform’s institutional home. But arXiv’s unassuming facade belies the tectonic reconfiguration it set off in the scientific community. If arXiv were to stop functioning, scientists from every corner of the planet would suffer an immediate and profound disruption. “Everybody in math and physics uses it,” Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “I scan it every night.”\n\nEvery industry has certain problems universally acknowledged as broken: insurance in health care, licensing in music, standardized testing in education, tipping in the restaurant business. In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.\n\nThe “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford. During crises like the Covid pandemic, time-sensitive breakthroughs were disseminated quickly—particularly by bioRxiv and medRxiv, platforms inspired by arXiv—potentially saving, by one study’s estimate, millions of lives.\n\nWhile arXiv submissions aren’t peer-reviewed, they are moderated by experts in each field, who volunteer their time to ensure that submissions meet basic academic standards and follow arXiv’s guidelines: original research only, no falsified data, sufficiently neutral language. Submissions also undergo automated checks for baseline quality control. Without these, pseudoscientific papers and amateur work would flood the platform.\n\nIn 2021, the journal Nature declared arXiv one of the “10 computer codes that transformed science,” praising its role in fostering scientific collaboration. (The article is behind a paywall—unlock it for $199 a year.) By a recent count, arXiv hosts more than 2.6 million papers, receives 20,000 new submissions each month, and has 5 million monthly active users. Many of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century have first appeared on the platform. The “transformers” paper that launched the modern AI boom? Uploaded to arXiv. Same with the solution to the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize problems, famous for their difficulty and $1 million rewards. Just because a paper is posted on arXiv doesn’t mean it won’t appear in a prestigious journal someday, but it’s often where research makes its debut and stays openly available. The transformers paper is still routinely accessed via arXiv.\n\nFor scientists, imagining a world without arXiv is like the rest of us imagining one without public libraries or GPS. But a look at its inner workings reveals that it isn’t a frictionless utopia of open-access knowledge. Over the years, arXiv’s permanence has been threatened by everything from bureaucratic strife to outdated code to even, once, a spy scandal. In the words of Ginsparg, who usually redirects interview requests to an FAQ document—on arXiv, no less—and tried to talk me out of visiting him in person, arXiv is “a child I sent off to college but who keeps coming back to camp out in my living room, behaving badly.”\n\nGinsparg and I met over the course of several days last spring in Ithaca, New York, home of Cornell University. I’ll admit, I was apprehensive ahead of our time together. Geoffrey West, a former supervisor of Ginsparg’s at Los Alamos National Laboratory, once described him as “quite a character” who is “infamous in the community” for being “quite difficult.” He also said he was “extremely funny” and a “great guy.” In our early email exchanges, Ginsparg told me, upfront, that stories about arXiv never impress him: “So many articles, so few insights,” he wrote.",

        "content": "When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI—which is nearly always—he moves. The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!\n\nAmodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.\n\nAmodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.\n\nNow a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.\n\nWhat Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.\n\nThat’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?\n\nOne of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.",

(Thankfully, Prime Video has the whole movie saga available, starting with Evangelion 1.11.) Nevertheless, snagging the international rights for this long-awaited film from Japan's Studio Khara was a genuine coup for Amazon. Thrice Upon a Time brings to a close the decades-long tale of traumatized teenage robot pilots forced to fight biblically accurate angels—and worse, the twisted machinations of lead character Shinji's abusive father, Gendo. With bewilderingly beautiful animation, plenty of emotional clout, and an ending that surprised even longtime fans, this is a textbook example of how to send a series out with a bang.\n\nThe Creator\n\nAfter an artificial intelligence developed by the US government nukes Los Angeles, the world is torn. By the mid 21st century, most of the West shuns AI, but consolidated New Asia embraces the tech, leading to a high-stakes, high-tech cold war. Caught in the middle is Joshua Taylor (John David Washington), an undercover US Army operative in New Asia sent on a mission to eliminate a deadly new AI weapon. What he finds is Alphie (Madeleine Yuna Voyles), a robotic child whose ability to control technology could change the world—and who may be connected to his lost wife Maya (Gemma Chan). A sleeper hit that you probably missed in cinemas, director Gareth Edwards’ striking sci-fi future isn't only a timely exploration of the impact of AI on humanity but also feels increasingly, perhaps worryingly, plausible with each passing day.\n\nChallengers\n\nDirected by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name), Challengers follows the complicated three-way relationship between tennis aces Tashi (Zendaya), Patrick (Josh O'Connor), and Art (Mike Faist). Told nonlinearly, it volleys between the trio's disaffected present and their more optimistic, exciting past. It's an energetic and inventively shot sports movie, but the real match tension is in how the promise of Grand Slam glory (and no shortage of raging hormones—it is a Guadagnino film, after all) in the trio's youth lead to choices that ricochet into the present. Tashi has been forced to abandon the court after a horrific injury, her now-husband Art is stuck in a competitive rut, and Patrick hustles low-stakes games to get by—but none of them have really moved on.\n\nMy Old Ass\n\nThe unstoppable rise of Aubrey Plaza continues in this smart, modern take on the coming-of-age dramedy. Written and directed by The Fallout’s Megan Park, My Old Ass follows 18-year old Elliott (Maisy Stella) who, on the cusp of college and major life changes, celebrates her birthday by taking mushrooms with her friends. Mid-trip, she meets … Elliott, age 39 (Plaza). It’s when she’s sobered up that things get really trippy, though. Elliott starts receiving text messages from the future—warning her to avoid a boy named Chad. Equal parts hopeful and melancholic, and with powerful performances from both actors playing an Elliott, this film beautifully captures the messy, joyful potential of youth and the nagging, wistful “what ifs?” that come with age. A delight however old you are.\n\nKiller Heat\n\nWhen private investigator Nick Bali (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in peak gumshoe mode) is called out to a Greek island by wealthy Penelope Vardakis (Shailene Woodley) to investigate the suspicious death of her brother-in-law, Leo (Richard Madden), the first clue something is amiss is that her husband Elias is Leo’s identical twin (Madden again, unsurprisingly)—and he's acting very suspicious about the whole “dead brother” thing. Adapted from Norwegian author Jo Nesbø's short story “The Jealousy Man,” Killer Heat hits all the usual notes when it comes to modern noir thrillers—Bali butts heads with local police, uncovers secrets even his client doesn't want revealed, and gets too close to the case—meaning this murder mystery won't win any awards for originality, but for fans of the genre it's a fun, almost cozy outing. At a breezy 90 minutes, and packed with gorgeous location photography, it's a great way to see out the summer.\n\nBrittany Runs a Marathon\n\nWhen Brittany (Jillian Bell) is told by her doctor to lose weight, she uses it as a reason to take control of her life. She starts by putting on a pair of trainers and challenging herself to run one block, which quickly escalates into deciding to run the New York City Marathon. First-time director Paul Downs Colaizzo based the story on the experiences of his friend, and highlights not only the benefits of running but also the pain. This film shows that no matter how bad things get, you can still get back up.\n\nThe Idea of You\n\nThe best rom-coms tend to succeed thanks to how unrealistic they are—the improbable meet-cute, the heightened emotions, the exaggerated gestures of affection, the dizzying spin of falling head over heels for someone. It's something The Idea of You perfectly nails as it charts the relationship between successful gallery owner Solène Marchand (Anne Hathaway) and global music superstar Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine)—who also happens to be 16 years her junior. It could so easily have been cheap scandal fodder—and that’s how it’s played in-universe when the paparazzi get wind of Hayes’ relationship with the “older woman”—but as the pair embark on a globe-trotting romance, the charismatic leads serve up enough genuine chemistry to sweep the audience up in the whirlwind of it all. It’s ultimately less “will they, won’t they?” and more “should they, shouldn’t they?” thanks to a well-handled awareness of the age gap (already narrowed from the source novel by Robinne Lee), but for fans of the genre, it’s a delight.\n\nRoad House\n\nThere’s been no shortage of controversy over director Doug Liman's update of the classic ’80s action flick, from arguments over its supposed cinematic release to its use of CGI for some aspects of its bone-crunching fight scenes. Step back from the real-world drama though, and this is a fun, turn-brain-off-now way to kill a lazy afternoon. Swapping in the Florida Keys for the original’s Missouri setting, and trading Patrick Swayze’s James Dalton for Jake Gyllenhaal’s brooding Elwood Dalton—now with a tortured past as a UFC fighter, of course—this still delivers a satisfying tale of one man clearing out local crime lords, one brutal fistfight at a time. It’s far from high art, but sometimes that’s exactly what you need. If you’re still not sold, it’s worth noting that the 1989 original is also currently on Prime for you to compare and contrast.\n\nSaltburn\n\nOxford student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is having trouble fitting in at the prestigious British university—until he befriends the popular Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Handsome, rich, and born to the landed gentry, Felix brings the awkward, socially invisible Oliver into his circle, eventually inviting him to spend summer at the family estate, Saltburn. But as Oliver works his way into the family's graces, his obsession with Felix takes increasingly dark and deranged turns. Oscillating between black comedy and psychological thriller, writer and director Emerald Fennel (Promising Young Woman) frames the film in 4:3 aspect ratio for a tighter, almost voyeuristic viewing experience that makes its frequently unsettling moments even more uncomfortable. Having attracted plenty of debate since its 2023 release—not least for how it questionably navigates its themes of class and social inclusion—Saltburn was one of the year's most divisive films, but one that demands your attention.\n\nThe Burial\n\nCourtroom dramas are rarely laugh riots, but this tale of funeral home director Jeremiah O'Keefe (Tommy Lee Jones) and his flashy lawyer Willie Gary (Jamie Foxx) taking on a major player in America's \"death care\" system brings a dark sense of humor to already grim proceedings. This is no comedy though. Based on true events, director Maggie Betts' (The Novitiate) latest drama retells a real-life legal case that exposed massive inequality in funereal care and the way Black communities were being regularly overcharged. Foxx and Jones are in top form throughout, but it's Jurnee Smollett as Mame Downes, Gary's rival attorney who threatens to outpace him at every turn, whose performance threatens to steal the whole movie. For a film about death, The Burial proves warmly life-affirming.\n\nA Million Miles Away\n\nCharting the life of José Hernández, this biopic—based on Hernández's own book—mixes the aspirational with the inspirational as it follows its central figure's rise from, in his own words, migrant farm worker to the first Mexican-American astronaut. Michael Peña is in fine form as Hernández, painting a picture of a man almost myopically driven to reach space, no matter the cost, while Rosa Salazar impresses as his wife Adela, refusing to fade into the background even as she puts her own dreams on pause for José to chase the stars. In lesser hands, this could all be cloying—a twee tale of hard work and achieving the American Dream, with a dash of NASA promo material on the side, but director Alejandra Márquez Abella has her lens as focused on the small beauties of life here on Earth as the splendor and sheer potential of space. A rare delight.\n\nRed, White, and Royal Blue\n\nLook, this is clearly a “best film” by a highly specific metric—and that metric is “gloriously cheesy trash.” Adapted from Casey McQuinston's best-selling novel, this intercontinental rom-com charts the relationship between First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the \"spare\" to the British throne, going from rivals through to grudging respect, and ultimately groundbreaking romance. It's often ludicrous, including an inciting incident seeing the pair falling into a wedding cake, a tabloid-worthy tryst in a hotel room, and political intrigue surrounding Alex's mother, President Ellen Claremont (Uma Thurman, vamping scenes with a bizarre “Texan” accent), but it's all just irresistibly wholesome and upbeat. Red, White, and Royal Blue is the movie equivalent of pizza—not good for you, but still delicious.\n\nShin Masked Rider\n\nIf you’re sick of cookie-cutter Hollywood superhero movies, then this ground-up reboot of one of Japan’s most beloved heroes deserves your attention. Helmed by Hideaki Anno (Evangelion, Shin Godzilla, Shin Ultraman—“shin” meaning “new” or “true” in Japanese), this revamps the 1971 TV series Kamen Rider. Like that show, it follows motorcyclist Takeshi Hongo (Sosuke Ikematsu). Kidnapped by the terrorist organization S.H.O.C.K.E.R. and forcibly converted into a powerful cyborg, Hongo escapes before being reprogrammed as an agent of the group, instead using his newfound powers to take down its forces. However, unlike the original, Anno’s approach taps into the body horror of the core concept, while also challenging his characters—and audience—to hang onto their intrinsic humanity in the face of a world trying to dehumanize them. It’s more violent than you’d probably expect, often showing the grisly outcome of regular people getting punched by superpowered cyborgs and monsters, but never gratuitous. While those with some understanding of the source material will get more out of Shin Masked Rider, it’s an exciting outing for anyone looking for something a bit fresher from their hero movies.\n\nAir\n\nSure, nowadays Michael Jordan is a bona fide sports god, and Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers are still arguably the court shoe—but that wasn’t the case back in 1984. Jordan was a rookie, and Nike was about to close down its basketball shoe division. Enter Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a talent scout for the footwear maker who has spotted a rising star in North Carolina who could turn everything around—he just needs to convince everyone else that Jordan is worth betting the company on. We all know how that panned out, so thankfully Air is more than a two-hour advert for shoes. Damon, Jason Bateman, Chris Tucker, and director Ben Affleck all deliver strong performances—only to be utterly eclipsed by Viola Davis in a magnetic and powerful, if somewhat underutilized, turn as matriarch Deloris Jordan—while Alex Convery’s script keeps the drama on the people and personalities involved rather than the boardroom. In an age of franchises and endless blockbusters, Air is the sort of character-focused film that rarely gets made anymore— and is all the more enjoyable for it.\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nSacha Baron Cohen’s “Kazakh” TV reporter (even if he speaks Hebrew) travels back to the US, 14 years after his last feature-long escapade. This time Baron Cohen has brought his (Bulgarian-speaking) teenage daughter along, with the mission of giving her “as a gift” to some powerful American politicians—initially Mike Pence, then Rudy Giuliani. In classic Boratic fashion, the mockumentary follows the wacky duo on a cavalcade across Trump’s America, filming candid performances by unsuspecting characters ranging from QAnon believers to Republican activists to prim debutantes, all the way to Giuliani himself. Even the coronavirus pandemic, which struck America as the film was being shot, is subverted as a comedic plot point. Baron Cohen delivers, with the expected repertoire of shock gags and deadpanned verbal enormities, and he manages to land some punches at the expense of bigots. In contrast to its 2006 predecessor, many of the pranks and stunts here seem more aimed at eliciting the audience’s nervous laughter than at exposing America’s heart of darkness, but it remains a worthy—and funny—watch.\n\nShotgun Wedding\n\nA raucous spin on the traditional romcom, Shotgun Wedding lures viewers with a cliché setup—a ceremony on a tropical island, with hijinks courtesy of bickering in-laws—before exploding, literally, into an action escapade as the wedding party is taken hostage by violent pirates. If we’re being honest, it’s a little hammy and self-aware in places, but leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel are clearly having so much fun as bride and groom Darcy and Tom, whose special day turns into an often hilariously gory battle for survival, that it’s easy to be swept along for the ride. With a solid supporting cast, including the ever-entertaining Jennifer Coolidge as the mother of the groom stealing every scene she graces with her gloriously chaotic presence, this is a wedding worth RSVPing to.\n\nNanny\n\nAisha (Anna Diop) is a Senegalese woman working as a nanny for a rich couple in New York City, hoping to earn enough to bring her son and cousin to join her in America. However, her future is at the mercy of her employers, who seem content to leave Aisha to raise their daughter, Rose, while often withholding her pay. As the stress of the power imbalance weighs on her, Aisha begins having strange dreams of drowning, worsened by her fears of abandoning her own child. The feature debut of director Nikyatu Jusu, Nanny contrasts the horror of the immigrant experience in modern America with something darker, while swapping the expected tropes of hope and opportunity for a palpable sadness for culture and community left behind. Nanny takes a slow-burn, psychological approach to its scares, but Diop is phenomenal throughout, and the meticulous pacing and gorgeous cinematography means every frame lingers.\n\nComing 2 America\n\nRelying on nostalgia to carry new entries in long-dormant series can be risky business, but Eddie Murphy’s return to the role of Prince—now King—Akeem of Zamunda more than three decades after 1988’s Coming to America shows how to do it right. Drawn back to the US in search of a son he never knew he had, Akeem—and the audience—gets to reunite with familiar faces from the first film, before director Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) reverses the formula and tests the American characters with a trip to Zamunda. With a sharper, smarter, and more globally aware script than the original, Coming 2 America defies the odds to be a comedy sequel that stands up to the reputation of its predecessor.\n\nThirteen Lives\n\nDirector Ron Howard’s latest gathers a top-notch cast—including Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton—for a dramatization of the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, where a Thai junior soccer team and their assistant coach were trapped in the flooded cave system. As an international effort mounts to save the children, the challenges of navigating miles of underwater caverns become ever more dangerous, and Howard masterfully captures every perilously claustrophobic moment of it. A nail-bitingly tense movie with some ingeniously shot aquatic scenes, Thirteen Lives is a testament to one of the most difficult rescues ever performed.\n\nOne Night in Miami …\n\nBased on the play of same name, One Night in Miami follows four icons of culture, music, and sports—Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Muhammad Ali—at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, a converging and pivotal point in their lives and careers. Meeting in a motel room in the wake of Ali’s—then still Cassius Clay—heavyweight victory over Sonny Liston in 1964, the four men discuss their roles in the movement and society as a whole, all while the audience knows the weight of history is bearing down on them. The close confines of much of the film reflect its theatrical roots, but this feature directorial debut from Regina King perfectly portrays the larger-than-life personalities of its cast. Kingsley Ben-Adir is on fire as Malcolm X, with Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr., and Eli Goree—as Brown, Cooke, and Ali—all utterly magnetic.\n\nThe Report\n\nProduced by Amazon, The Report is an engrossing depiction of the US Senate's investigation into the CIA's “enhanced interrogation” program—how it came to be, who knew about it, and how the CIA massaged the facts to support its efficacy. Adam Driver stars as Daniel Jones, the lead investigator who plowed an increasingly lonely path to the truth, battling against political resistance and CIA interference all the way. Driver is, as is his habit these days, superb, and the film's 82 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes is well earned.\n\nSound of Metal\n\nPunk-rock drummer and recovering addict Ruben starts experiencing hearing loss, and it threatens to upend his entire life. Faced with an impossible choice between giving up his hearing or giving up his career, Ruben begins to spiral, until his girlfriend Lou checks him into a rehab center for the deaf, forcing him to confront his own behavior as much as the future he faces. Riz Ahmed is in spectacular form as the troubled Ruben, while Olivia Cooke’s turn as Lou, who suffers with her own demons, including self-harm, is riveting. Fittingly enough, Sound of Metal also features incredibly nuanced use of sound—and its absence—as director Darius Marder crafts one of the finest dramas in recent years.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In January, with a nationwide ban on TikTok looming, hundreds of thousands of people in the US began flocking to another Chinese social media app called RedNote—only to find that Maye Musk, Elon Musk’s mother, had already established a relatively large audience on the platform. Maye, who has become a celebrity in her own right in China over the past few years, had over 600,000 followers on RedNote when the flood of Americans arrived.\n\n“I need to find the block button,” one American user commented under Maye’s latest video at the time, which has received over 10,000 likes. “I can’t believe I’m witnessing American people confronting Musk’s mom to her face,” another comment in Chinese reads. Shortly afterward, Maye’s comment section on RedNote was closed for several weeks. New comments didn’t start showing up again until early February.\n\nThe incident represented a rare moment when the parallel public images Maye Musk has created for herself collided. In China, the 76 year-old has built a largely apolitical reputation as a “silver influencer,” fashion model for local brands, and book author who regularly garners positive coverage in Chinese state media, The New York Times previously reported. Last week, she made another trip to China, this time to the city of Wuxi, where she was invited to watch a drone show, promoted traditional crafts, and posed with a special Tesla model that comes in different colorways sold only in Asia.\n\nBut in the US, Maye’s career has increasingly converged with Elon’s as her son gained unprecedented power and influence over the US federal government. Since President Trump won reelection, Maye has traveled on Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-a-Lago dinner party, and attended a luncheon with Ivanka Trump, while also regularly firing off posts on X about US politics, according to a WIRED review of her social media presence.\n\nIn many ways, Maye appears to be trying to straddle the fine line between her political engagement in the US and her business dealings in China and other foreign countries. That endeavor has become more fraught over the past two months as Trump began radically reshaping US foreign policy, including imposing new tariffs on China. “There’s a heightened risk now for American business people traveling to China and that continues to increase, especially as tensions in the trade war will increase,” says Holden Triplett, cofounder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former senior FBI official posted in Beijing.\n\nMaye Musk’s business manager and Creative Artists Agency, her talent-representative agency in China, did not reply to requests for comment from WIRED.\n\nEven before she began traveling regularly to China, Maye publicly supported Elon’s and Tesla’s business endeavors in the country. In 2015, she retweeted a post by Elon in which he mentioned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Great trip to China seeing President Xi ... Pic w China team in state garden,” the tweet reads, which was later deleted from Elon’s profile.",

        "content": "As we reported last week, even electric-auto maker Rivian is getting in on that sweet, sweet electric bike action. And at first glance, the N+ Bikes Mercedes-AMG F1 electric bike looks to be another bike in a continuing trend of auto manufacturers making and selling much smaller motor-powered vehicles.\n\nBut unlike Ford's electric bike, this specific class II ebike isn't made by Mercedes. Even if it has the iconic three-pointed star on the frame (and it is an officially licensed product of Mercedes AMC Petronas Formula One Team), it's designed and manufactured by N+ Bikes, based out of California.\n\nThe aluminum, fully rigid frame has a sleek, race-car appeal. Its matte black color pops with well-placed Petronas green (aka turquoise) highlights in the interior of the fork and chain stays, a nod to Formula One fans. The bike’s cockpit looks like a miniature Mercedes dashboard, complete with two retro speedometers—one for speed and the other for watts. The former tops out at 60 mph, despite the fact that the motor legally has to cut out when speeds reach 20 mph. Still, if you're a Mercedes fan, this will probably matter to you that the bike is Mercedes-branded, not Mercedes-made.\n\nPhotograph: N+ Bikes\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nWhat about the stats? E-spec-wise, the bike has a powerful motor for a commuter, 750 watts, that lives in the rear-wheel hub and provides four modes of power from Normal to Race. The 48-volt battery lives in the down tube and offers an advertised range of 70 miles.\n\nThere’s space to store an additional 48-volt battery (sold separately) in the very thick and futuristic-looking seat post. Neither of the batteries are easily removable, making it a challenging bike to charge from the office or to use in a cold-weather destination, where batteries often need to be brought inside.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In the late 2000s, McKenzie and the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook devised a problem that seemed like a promising candidate. Called the tree evaluation problem, it involves repeatedly solving a simpler math problem that turns a pair of input numbers into a single output. Copies of this math problem are arranged in layers like the matches in a tournament bracket: The outputs of each layer become the inputs to the next layer until there’s just one output remaining. Different tree evaluation algorithms represent different strategies for calculating this final output from the initial inputs—they might perform the calculations in a different order, or record the results of intermediate steps in a different way.\n\nMany algorithms can solve the tree evaluation problem quickly, putting it in the class P. But every such algorithm must devote some memory to the numbers it’s working with, while also storing numbers it’s already calculated for use in later steps. That’s why Cook and McKenzie suspected that the problem was impossible to solve using limited memory. They formalized this intuition in a 2010 paper coauthored with three other researchers, and proved that every ordinary algorithm for solving the tree evaluation problem required too much memory to qualify for membership in L.\n\nBut their work didn’t rule out the possibility of bizarre algorithms that could somehow use the same piece of memory for storage and calculations simultaneously—the computing equivalent of using a page filled with important notes as scratch paper. Cook and McKenzie thought such outlandish algorithms couldn’t exist, and they were confident enough to put money on it: Anyone who could prove them wrong would win a cool $100.\n\nCatalytic Conversion\n\nMichal Koucký, a complexity theorist at Charles University in Prague, learned about the tree evaluation result from Cook during a 2011 sabbatical in Toronto. He grew determined to finish what Cook and McKenzie had started, by proving that there’s no way to do additional computations using memory that’s saving data for later. Koucký’s quest would lead him on an unexpected detour to the discovery of catalytic computing. Nearly a decade later, that discovery would inspire two young researchers to return to tree evaluation and settle Cook and McKenzie’s bet once and for all.\n\nBut back to the story of catalytic computing. It all started when Koucký visited colleagues in Amsterdam and posed the question that had been preoccupying him in simpler terms: What can you do with memory that’s already full?\n\n“Nothing” was the obvious answer. “I thought, ‘OK, this is of course very useless, and we’re going to prove it,’” said Harry Buhrman, the leader of the Amsterdam group. “And then we couldn’t prove it.”\n\nUsing an approach called catalytic computing, Harry Buhrman and Michal Koucký showed that even full memory could theoretically aid computation. Photograph: Bob Bronshoff/Quanta Magazine Photograph: Thomas Rubin/Quanta Magazine\n\nThe breakthrough came months later, when Buhrman was visiting his frequent collaborator Richard Cleve at the University of Waterloo. They decided to focus on an extreme scenario, one where the full memory is very large. If a computer with little free memory can access this massive full memory, would that enable it to solve problems that would be impossible with the free memory alone? It’s like the “hard drive full of family photos” question, but with a hard drive the size of a data center.\n\nIf that extra data is untouchable—you can’t interact with it at all—then it definitely doesn’t help. But what if you’re allowed to tweak some of the bits encoding this data, as long as you promise to reset them when you’re done? You can’t simply keep a record of your changes, since that would take up even more space, so instead you’ll have to ensure that your changes are easily reversible. What’s more, you don’t get to choose the content of the extra data, so whatever you do must work for any possible initial configuration of bits.",

        "content": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nElon Musk is averse to understatement. Last night, at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the world’s richest man bounded onstage in a cheesehead and handed out a pair of oversize checks worth $1 million apiece. The payouts went to two signatories of a petition against “activist judges,” though it’s clear that Musk’s aim was to support a judge who might tip the balance of Wisconsin’s state supreme court. The billionaire knows that his fortune helped propel Donald Trump to the White House last fall, and now he’s seeing what else money can buy.\n\nMusk and Trump are supporting Brad Schimel, a conservative judge from Waukesha County who trails in the polls behind his liberal opponent, Judge Susan Crawford of Dane County. So far, Musk has personally donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party, and two Musk-linked PACs have spent much more. The state court’s makeup is 4–3 in the liberals’ favor, and the judges are poised to issue rulings on a variety of topics, including voting regulations, abortion rights, and the redrawing of congressional maps to combat Republican gerrymandering, which could chip away at Republicans’ narrow House majority. Democrats tried and failed to block Musk’s million-dollar gambit, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court allowed Musk to proceed. This morning, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler warned that the race could determine “whether Elon Musk can buy courts.”\n\nIn the pre-Trump era, tomorrow’s contest may have been something of a run-of-the-mill state election. Instead, this race has exploded into a national spectacle. Wisconsin has significantly loosened its campaign-finance restrictions in recent years, and with a reported $90 million pouring in from both sides, it’s the most expensive judicial election ever. But as Musk knows, the whole ordeal is bigger than deciding the composition of one state court. In many ways, tomorrow’s election is also a potential validation—or referendum—on the profound upheaval that Trump and Musk have wrought on the United States over the past nine weeks.\n\nLast night, Musk tried to convey the gravitas of the situation. As he often does, the billionaire went a bit hyperbolic. “What’s happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives,” Musk told the room, in reference to the redistricting. “Whichever party controls the House to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization.” No pressure!\n\nMusk was occasionally interrupted by protesters, whom he scoffed were operatives hired by the left-leaning billionaire George Soros to disrupt his event. Soros and another billionaire, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, are among those who have donated to the Democrats as a means of helping Crawford, but no one has been as audacious as Musk in wooing potential voters using the reliable lever of cold hard cash. Beyond awarding two attendees the million-dollar checks, Musk’s PAC also promised $100 to anyone who signs the same petition, and $20 to anyone who posts a photo of someone holding a picture of Schimel and flashing a thumbs-up (in addition to various payouts for those who “recruit” Wisconsin voters to do the same, even people, such as himself, who live outside of the state). If Musk and his PAC’s collective efforts prove successful tomorrow, he’ll likely keep seeing what else he can buy as he seeks to expand his sphere of influence.\n\nUntil about a decade ago, dark money was the most apt phrase to discuss a range of shady, financially motivated political tactics. But Musk is carrying out his plans in broad daylight. His bold flouting of norms is a point of pride for him, not a secret. His PAC ran similar lotteries in swing states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, last year, and so far, state courts have yet to rule that he’s breaking election law. And in Wisconsin’s case, by helping mold the court, he also seems to be ensuring his own future success. As CNN noted, Musk’s beleaguered electric-vehicle company Tesla happens to be fighting a Wisconsin law that would keep car manufacturers from running company-owned dealerships in the state.\n\n“It’s a super big deal,” Musk said last night. “I’m not phoning it in.” Standing in front of a giant American flag, he whipped out a magic marker and appeared to autograph his cheesehead before flinging it out into the crowd like a Frisbee. So far, Musk’s move-fast-and-break-things approach to navigating the contours of the American government has created chaos in federal agencies and diminished his personal fortune. But his very simple election strategy—give people money—has worked. Musk may be failing at some things, but having a lot of money is not one of them.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nDonald Trump said that he is weighing running for a third term, which is banned by the Constitution.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Mike White is not just the writer of The White Lotus. He is also its creator, director, and executive producer, and I’m surprised that he doesn’t do the catering and animal-handling, too. This unusual level of control makes The White Lotus the polar opposite of, say, the Marvel films, which feel like they’re written by one committee, edited by another, and marketed by a third.\n\nAnd what has White done with his unusual level of creative control? He has made the first great work of art in the post-“woke” era. He treats his characters as individuals, rather than stand-ins for their identity groups—and he insists on plot points that would unnerve a sensitivity reader.\n\nHannah Giorgis: The rich tourists who want more, and more, and more\n\nThe White Lotus repudiates the “peak woke” era of the late 2010s, which yielded safe, self-congratulatory, and didactic art, obsessed with identity and language, that taught pat moral lessons in an eat-your-greens tone. Instead, White has made a point of discovering our last remaining taboos—kink, scatology, marrying for money, male nudity deployed so frequently in moments of high tension that culture scholars call it the “melodramatic penis”—and then putting them all on-screen, with a luxury hotel or a superyacht as the backdrop. If you’ve watched Episode 6 of the latest season, set in Thailand, cross Arnold Schwarzenegger’s son’s character has a drug-fueled threesome involving his brother off your bingo card.\n\nBut that scene—the explicit fraternal bonding between Saxon and Lochlan Ratliff during a hookup with the high-class escort Chloe—wasn’t the one that caused the most chatter among my friends. Far more shocking was a four-minute monologue in Episode 5 by a minor character, Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), that drew on one of the most incendiary findings in sexology: that some otherwise straight men are aroused by the thought of themselves as women.\n\nIn a bar in Bangkok, Frank explains to his old friend Rick (Walton Goggins) why he got sober since they last saw each other years ago. “I moved here because, well, I had to leave the States, but I picked Thailand because I always had a thing for Asian girls, you know?” Frank says.\n\nAt first, he took Asian women home for sex, but he began to find that boring. “Maybe what I really want,” Frank goes on, “is to be one of these Asian girls?” In a monologue punctuated by Rick’s occasional raised eyebrows, Frank describes how his behavior escalated. His quest for sexual satisfaction culminated in him buying lingerie, inviting white men over to “rail” him, and paying Asian women to watch them. This behavior led to a kind of spiritual awakening. “Am I a middle-aged white guy on the inside, too?” Frank wondered. “Or inside, could I be an Asian girl?” Eventually, he realized he had to stop “the drugs, the girls, the trying to be a girl.” So then Frank took up Buddhism—a religion that multiple characters in this season see as the antidote to Western materialism and their own obsessions.\n\nThroughout Frank’s monologue, Rick looks perplexed—as well he might. But on X, Ray Blanchard—a real-life researcher who coined the term autogynephilia to describe men’s sexual arousal at the idea of themselves as women—expressed delight about the scene. Many in the LGBTQ movement have dismissed autogynephilia as a slur that reframes some trans women as nothing more than men with a fetish. Out Magazine recently described Blanchard’s idea as “a widely discredited pseudoscientific theory from the 80s.” And yet here it was being discussed on television’s buzziest show.\n\nSuggesting that cross-dressing has a sexual component is even more subversive than, say, a graphic first-season sex scene featuring the hotel manager and one of his male employees. You might have thought that no taboos were left, but here is something as countercultural as Star Trek’s interracial kiss in the 1960s, or Ellen DeGeneres coming out in a 1997 episode of her sitcom, Ellen. Notably, unlike in the past, a screenwriter seems “brave” today by challenging liberals rather than religious conservatives.\n\nCalling Mike White “anti-woke” makes him sound dreary and polemicist, when he is really irreverent and quietly moral. His father was once a ghostwriter for homophobic evangelicals such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, before acknowledging that he was gay himself in middle age. Mel White put his son through private school and college working for men who hated him for who he was. And then, when he had the financial independence to do so, Mel came out—but still joined Falwell’s congregation in Lynchburg, Virginia, despite the abuse that followed, and tried to convince his fellow Christians that religious faith and homosexuality could coexist.\n\nSophie Gilbert: The erudite, absurd White Lotus finale\n\nMel’s son had a different political trajectory. By his own account, Mike White once had conventional left-wing politics. He wrote an undergraduate thesis on Judith Butler, the high priest of postmodernism, when he was studying at Wesleyan University, which he has described as “the P.C. school, before institutions all became sort of like that.” In interviews, he has talked about how mind-blowing he found Camille Paglia’s Sexual Personae, a 1990 book that is deeply critical of feminism, defied what was then called political correctness, and contains bracing, before-its-time sentences such as “The reform of a college English department cuts no ice down at the corner garage.”\n\nIn the first season of The White Lotus, set in Maui, White pays Paglia homage: The snobby college student Olivia (Sydney Sweeney) has her book. Meanwhile, Olivia’s friend Paula (Brittany O’Grady) reads an anti-colonialism treatise by Frantz Fanon as native Hawaiians serve them cocktails by the pool. (Of course Paula also has a copy of Butler’s Gender Trouble.) In the second season, set in Sicily, Portia (Haley Lu Richardson) tries to talk herself into dating clean-cut Albie by observing that “he’s nice and smart. He went to Stanford, and—he’s not nonbinary.” White is mocking Portia’s world, in which so many students have minority sexual and gender identities that a standard-issue straight guy makes a refreshing change.\n\nFor that season, White created a cabal of murderous gay men—an offense against the liberal orthodoxy that movies and TV shows must portray members of disadvantaged groups in virtuous ways. Even though this plot was a huge hit with gay audiences, White’s gay villains made some cultural gatekeepers uncomfortable. “Barely anyone seemed triggered by White Lotus,” Beth Greenfield seemed to lament on Yahoo Entertainment.\n\nShirley Li: The sex lives of the one percent\n\nIn a recent discussion with White on his podcast, the gay conservative writer Andrew Sullivan decried Hollywood’s portrayal of gay characters, since the height of the AIDS epidemic, as suffering saints—as in the 1993 movie Philadelphia, which stars Tom Hanks as a doomed gay patient. Sullivan, who has written movingly about being diagnosed with HIV in the ’90s, praised White for allowing gay characters more emotional range. “I was hoping, you know, this was 30 years ago, that one day the gays will be presented as humans,” Sullivan said. “And so my big thrill, your second season of White Lotus, was the evil gays.”\n\nWhite, who recently described himself on Sullivan’s podcast as a “guy who has sex with men,” appears particularly unconstrained in his portrayal of LGBTQ characters. In 2022, he said that “there’s a pleasure to me as a guy who is gay-ish to make gay sex transgressive again.” Frank’s autogynephilic liaisons with men and the Ratliff brothers’ incestuous threesome certainly fit into that category too.\n\nWhat makes The White Lotus feel like the cultural product of a new era is that White doesn’t try to build shallow morality plays around these or any other characters. Nor does he drop in stock “Karens”—think of the way And Just Like That turned Sex and the City’s leads into idiot middle-aged ladies whom minor characters endlessly lecture about their outdated attitudes—whose primary job is to provide teachable moments. His plots and characters share elements from his own life. “Unless I feel somehow personally indicted, it doesn’t feel like I’m doing anything that bold,” he recently told The New Yorker. He bought a house in Hawaii after writing Enlightened, a series whose flaky lead character attends a rehab program there. He turned to Buddhist self-help books when he had a breakdown while writing a Fox sitcom, about an oddball family, called Cracking Up.\n\nWhite’s most countercultural belief is that a heavy focus on identity is a prison, not a liberation. He told Sullivan that his time as an actor made him feel limited by his appearance, whereas writing allowed him to explore the way that “we’re all monkeys, first of all—we’re all apes—and we also share so much.”\n\nAbove all, his shows are fun—anarchic, dirty, humane. They have the message of 18th-century novels such as Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, which lets readers revel in the filth of the prostitute Fanny Hill’s life before offering them the “tail-piece of morality.” Viewers crave yachts, and hot people, and terrible mistakes, and hot people making terrible mistakes on yachts. Give them that, and underneath you can smuggle the message that it’s all incredibly hollow and unfulfilling. After a decade when too many television shows had the tone of a Sesame Street episode on healthy eating, White’s formula of miserable rich people in sunny climates is a huge relief.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Leonard Bernstein’s way with orchestras that wouldn’t give him what he wanted was usually imploring, even beseeching. He was disappointed—the musicians were not so much failing him, the conductor, as failing the composer, failing the music. But on one occasion, his disappointment turned to anger. In 1972, he was working with the Vienna Philharmonic on Gustav Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. Mahler had been the head of the Vienna Court Opera and had conducted the Philharmonic from 1897 to 1907.\n\nExplore the May 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nThis was their own music—and they were holding back. Bernstein was rehearsing the stormy first movement of the Fifth Symphony. In his own score of the work, now lodged at the New York Philharmonic Archives, he had written, before the opening movement, “Rage—hostility—sublimation by Mahler and heaven.” And then, “Angry bitter sorrow mixed with sad comforting lullabies—rocking a corpse.” But he was getting neither rage nor consolation from the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nSighing and shrugging, irritably flipping pages of the score back and forth, he finally burst out (in German): “You can play the notes, I know that. It’s Mahler that’s missing!” The orchestra had arrived at the anguished climax toward the end of the movement, and the strings—by habit sweet and lustrous—were not playing with the harsh intensity that he wanted. “I’m aware that it’s only a rehearsal. But what are we rehearsing?” It was an implied threat to walk out.\n\nBernstein later reported hearing grumbling from the ranks. “Scheisse Musik.” Shit music. Scheisse Musik was Jewish music. Mahler was a Bohemian Jew. “They thought it was long and blustery and needlessly complicated and heart-on-sleeve and overemotional,” Bernstein said later in a documentary interview about his relations with the orchestra. The Philharmonic, after banning Mahler during the Nazi period, had played his great, tangled, tormented later symphonies only a few times. The orchestra didn’t know the music; the musicians didn’t love it.\n\nThe moment is startling because this was hardly Bernstein’s initial encounter with the esteemed Vienna Philharmonic. He had first conducted the orchestra in 1966, and with enormous success (bouquets were flung; champagne was poured), so his wrath carried a hint of betrayal, as if to say, “We are squandering a lot of hard work.” Turning Mahler into a universal classic—not just a long-winded composer of emotionally extreme symphonies—was part of Bernstein’s mission, part of his understanding of the 20th century, and essential to his identity as an American Jew. In their prejudice against Mahler, which was both racial and musical, the Germans and Austrians at the core of classical tradition had torn out of themselves a vital source of self-knowledge as well as musical glory. Destroying Mahler made it easier for them to become Nazis. Bernstein was determined to restore what they had rejected.\n\nBernstein needed the Vienna Philharmonic, and it needed him too. In fact, after the war, the orchestra needed him desperately.\n\nHe was proud of America’s musical achievements—proud of the work of the composers Charles Ives and Aaron Copland, and perhaps even prouder of the enduring native talent for popular Broadway entertainment, which, in 1972, was largely a Jewish creation. He had ennobled that tradition himself with the galvanizing West Side Story and the brilliant potpourri that is Candide, an homage to Voltaire’s satire and to European operatic styles, shaped into the greatest American operetta. Ever eager to break down the barriers between classical and popular music, he put elements of jazz into his work. In the ’20s, Europeans had certainly become conscious of American jazz, and Bernstein wanted to enlarge that recognition; he wanted to join America to world culture, even world history.\n\nFrom the December 1957 issue: Leonard Bernstein on ‘Speaking of Music’\n\nIt turned out that he needed the Vienna Philharmonic, and it needed him too. In fact, after the war, the orchestra needed him desperately. That angry rehearsal was a cultural watershed. Bernstein demanded that Vienna, and Europe in general, acknowledge what both America and Mahler meant to the 20th century—the century that the Europeans had played such a dreadful part in and that the Americans had helped liberate from infamy. An American Jew had become the necessary instrument in the New World’s reforming embrace of the disgraced Old.\n\nThe child of Ukrainian immigrants, Bernstein grew up in suburban Boston, an irrepressibly musical little boy who loved listening to the radio and beat out rhythms on the windowsills at home. He didn’t have a piano until he was 10. His father, Sam, notoriously refused to pay for piano lessons, but when he finally relented, Lenny accelerated to full speed, working with the best piano teachers in the Boston area, including the well-known German pianist Heinrich Gebhard. In the summers, he stayed at the family cottage in Sharon, Massachusetts. As a teenager there, Lenny mounted a production of Carmen in which he played the temptress, wearing a red wig and a black mantilla, and a tumultuous Mikado in which he sang the part of Nanki-poo.\n\nLet me make a comparison with a renowned European musician. In 1908, Herbert von Karajan was born in Salzburg, Mozart’s birthplace. There were at least two pianos at home, and Karajan played through Haydn and Beethoven symphonies with his family. On special evenings, string and woodwind players among the family’s Salzburg friends would assemble at the house for chamber music. When he was 6, Karajan took classes at the Mozarteum, the school that preserved the Austro-German musical legacy. He spent his summers with his family on a stunning mountain lake, the Grundlsee, 60 kilometers east of Salzburg.\n\nThe contrast makes an American happy: on the one side, tradition, serious public performance, luxury; on the other, émigré teachers, amateur musicales and family shenanigans, casual summers in the modest countryside. Yet what Boston and its environs had to offer in the 1930s, however scrappy, was enough to bring out Lenny’s talent. Karajan was a prodigy; Bernstein was a genius.\n\nFrom the November 1954 issue: Leonard Bernstein’s ‘Symphony or Musical Comedy?’\n\nOn November 14, 1943, the 25-year-old American conducted the New York Philharmonic without rehearsal; the concert was nationally broadcast on CBS Radio, and Bernstein was famous by the next day. In the following years, he conducted all over the country while working on his own classical compositions, including his Symphony No. 1 (Jeremiah), based on biblical texts. By the time he was 40, in 1958, he had created the Broadway successes On the Town and Wonderful Town, in addition to Candide and West Side Story, as well as some of his enduring classical scores. In that same year, he took over as music director of the New York Philharmonic.\n\nInitially, there was a lot of excitement in the press—the first American at the helm of one of the great orchestras! But the tone soon became hostile, even acrimonious. Audiences loved Bernstein, but his full-bodied manner on the podium—arms, head, hips, shoulders, eyebrows, groin in motion—caused embarrassment and even anger. The critic and composer Virgil Thomson, writing in the New York Herald Tribune, complained of “corybantic choreography” and “the miming of facial expression of uncontrolled emotional states.” In the arts, embarrassment may be the superego of emotion: This liberated Jewish body dismayed not only Thomson but the fastidious descendants of German Jews in New York, especially Harold C. Schonberg, the chief music critic of The New York Times starting in 1960, who gave Bernstein terrible reviews for years. In the eyes of Schonberg and others, Bernstein was hammy, exaggeratedly expressive, undignified: He was Broadway; he was show business; he lacked seriousness. The ecstasies of classical music are supposed to be, well, clean. But here was this lusciously handsome young man, a little overripe, leading orchestras in Haydn and Beethoven.\n\nI went to a lot of Philharmonic concerts in Bernstein’s early days as music director, and I heard some things that were under-rehearsed and overdriven, a bit coarse, without the discipline and mastery that were so extraordinary in his later years. But the playing was always vital, the programs exciting. And one concert, given on April 2, 1961, changed my life. It was a performance of Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, a monster with six movements, 95 minutes of outrageously stentorian swagger and odd, folkish nostalgia, capped by a lengthy adagio marked Langsam. Ruhevoll. Empfunden (“Slowly. Tranquil. Deeply Felt”). ﻿Bernstein took the adagio at a very slow tempo indeed, considerably slower than did many subsequent conductors, who, I daresay, would have had trouble holding it together at that speed. But the tempo wasn’t remarkable in itself. What was remarkable was the sustained tension and momentum of the movement and the sense of improvisation within it—the slight hesitations; the phrases explored, caressed; and also the singing tone of the entire orchestra at those impossibly slow speeds, all of it leading to the staggering climax at the end.\n\nBernstein at 25, rehearsing his Jeremiah symphony with the New York Philharmonic in 1944 (New York Daily News Archive / Getty)\n\nThe audience erupted into applause, and I remember thinking (I was 17), Anyone who doesn’t know that this man is a great musician can’t hear a thing—or something like that. (The Mahler Third was recorded within the next few days at the Manhattan Center, on West 34th Street. What I heard then, you can hear now on a Sony CD and a variety of streaming services.) After the concert, I went home shaken. That last movement opened gates of sensation and feeling that I had never experienced before, at least not outside of dreams. I was a very repressed and frightened teenager, and the music granted permission, a kind of encouragement to come out of myself and meet the world. The word awakening sounds banal, but I don’t know how else to describe what happened. Bernstein had that effect on many people. But it took his first engagement with the Vienna Philharmonic to awaken New York’s critics, which became one of the great ironies of American musical taste.\n\nDuring that first stint in Vienna, in 1966, Bernstein conducted Verdi’s Falstaff (at the Staatsoper, the orchestra’s sister organization, formerly known as the Vienna Court Opera). With the Philharmonic, he also did some Mozart, along with Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, the orchestral work for two voices that was in fact part of its repertoire. (It was the convoluted and violent later symphonies—masterpieces, all—that the orchestra resisted.) The ovations in 1966 went on forever, in a startling kind of release that even Bernstein, who certainly enjoyed acclaim, thought was a bit curious. “I’m a sort of Jewish hero who has replaced Karajan,” he wrote to his wife, Felicia. And a couple of weeks later, making a report to his parents:\n\nYou never know if the public that is screaming bravo for you might contain someone who 25 years ago might have shot me dead. But it’s better to forgive, and if possible, forget … What they call the “Bernstein wave” that has swept Vienna has produced some strange results; all of a sudden it’s fashionable to be Jewish.\n\nThe reference to Karajan was far from casual. The prodigious child of Salzburg had become a dominant figure in European classical music. In 1954, when he and Bernstein were both working at La Scala, they talked late into the night. Lenny wrote to Felicia: “I became real good friends with von Karajan, whom you would (and will) adore. My first Nazi.” (Karajan had joined the party in 1935 and remained in it until the end of the war.)\n\nBernstein’s way of appropriating ex-Nazis has elements of both seduction and triumph. When he went to Vienna in 1966, he had to deal with the repulsive truth that a man named Helmut Wobisch, a former trumpet player in the Philharmonic, was now the manager of the Philharmonic. Wobisch had worked for the SS during the war, and was likely involved in expelling Jewish members from the orchestra. Bernstein referred to him in public as “my dearest Nazi,” and there are photos of Wobisch happily greeting the maestro at the Vienna airport.\n\nBernstein made grim jokes, but he wanted to woo these men away from their past, their guilt; he would win them over, asserting not only Jewish talent but Jewish forgiveness. He and Karajan developed a friendly rivalry. On different occasions, when they were working in Vienna and Salzburg at the same time, they took turns upstaging each other in public. One was a perfectionist who gave performances of stunning power that sometimes became smoothed out and even bland through repetition; the other was full of surprises—always discovering things, a sensibility always in the making. For years, they represented two versions of musical culture: the authoritarian essence of the Old World and the democratic essence of the Jewish-immigrant New World.\n\nFrom the April 1955 issue: Leonard Bernstein’s ‘A Nice Gershwin Tune’\n\nThat an American conductor of any kind was enjoying acclaim in Europe was itself cause for wonder. From Bernstein’s point of view, the odds had always been stacked against him. Some years after that 1966 triumph, he wrote the distinguished Austrian conductor Karl Böhm:\n\nYou were born in the lap of Mozart, Wagner and Strauss, with full title to their domain; whereas I was born in the lap of Gershwin and Copland, and my title in the kingdom of European music was, so to speak, that of an adopted son.\n\nBut by 1972, the positions of son and elders were reversed, and Bernstein’s tone as he fought the Vienna Philharmonic in that rehearsal of the Mahler Fifth was anything but abashed. Bernstein did not, of course, walk out of the turbulent session. He stayed, and he drove the Vienna Philharmonic hard. An American Jew would make them play this music.\n\nIn a 1984 video lecture called “The Little Drummer Boy,” Bernstein insisted that Mahler’s genius depended on combining two laughably incompatible musical strains—the strengths of the Austro-German symphonic line and the awkward and homely sounds of shtetl life recalled from the composer’s youth in Bohemia. The exultant and tragic horn calls in the symphonies and in Das Lied von der Erde—were these not the potent echoes of the shofar summoning the congregation on High Holidays? The banal village tunes that Mahler altered into sinister mock vulgarities—did these not recall the raffish klezmer bands, the wandering musicians who played at shtetl weddings?\n\nThe ambiguity, the exaltation and sarcastic self-parody, the gloom alternating with a yearning for simplicity and even for redemption—all of that reflected the split consciousness of Jews who could never belong and turned revenge upon themselves. In a remark that Bernstein often quoted, Mahler said, “I am thrice homeless. As a native of Bohemia in Austria, as an Austrian among Germans, and as a Jew throughout all the world. Everywhere an intruder, never welcomed.”\n\nGustav Mahler during his directorship of the Vienna Court Opera (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nMahler was demanding and short-tempered, and shame—the shame of being a Jew—may have been an element in his volatile disposition; Bernstein felt that it was. Leading orchestras in London, Tel Aviv, and Berlin, as well as in Vienna and New York, he performed the symphonies and song cycles with a violence and tenderness that ended any further talk of shame. By advocating for Mahler as powerfully as Bernstein did, he helped bring the Jewish contribution to Austro-German culture back into the lives of Europeans—and perhaps also a range of emotions, including access to the bitter ironies of self-knowledge that had been eliminated from consciousness during the Nazi period. Mahler died in 1911, but Bernstein believed that Mahler knew; he understood in advance what the 20th century would bring of violence and harrowing guilt. “Marches like a heart attack,” Bernstein wrote in his score of Mahler’s apocalyptic Sixth Symphony. The tangled assertion and self-annihilation, the vaunted hopes and apocalyptic grief—that was our modern truth. It was all there in the music.\n\nIn 2018, the Jewish Museum Vienna mounted an exhibit called “Leonard Bernstein: A New Yorker in Vienna.” The accompanying catalog featured the words “Bernstein in Vienna became the medium through which a prosperous democratic German-speaking cultural community could display its newly found post-war liberal tastes.” Yes, exactly. The ovations for Bernstein went on forever in part because Vienna was celebrating its release from infamy. Perhaps only an American Jew—open, friendly, but a representative of a conquering power—could have produced the effect that Bernstein did.\n\nAfter his initial Vienna triumph in 1966, Bernstein returned to New York, and the embarrassment and condescending reviews petered out. Vienna had taught New York how to listen. The Europeans were enchanted by the expressive fluency that the New York critics had considered vulgar. Everyone but the prigs realized that Bernstein’s gestural bounty was both utterly sincere and very successful at getting what he wanted. He wasn’t out of control; he was asserting control. Karajan, by contrast, worked through the details in rehearsal and then, in performance, stood there with his eyes closed, beating time, thrusting out his aggressive chin and mastering the orchestra with his stick and his left hand. He was fascinating but almost frightening to watch.\n\nKarajan radiated power when he conducted; Bernstein radiated love. Smiling, imploring, flirting, and commanding, he cued every section and almost every solo, and often subdivided the beat for greater articulation. If you were watching him, either in the hall or on television, he pulled you into the structural and dramatic logic of a piece. He was not only narrative in flight; he was an emotional guide to the perplexed. For all his egotism, there was something selfless in his work.\n\nFrom the November 1976 issue: The Mahler boom\n\nIn 1988, when Bernstein and Karajan were both close to death, they had a final talk in Vienna. Karajan, after neglecting Mahler’s music for decades, had taken up the composer in his 60s and eventually produced two glorious recorded performances of the Ninth Symphony. The Austrian could no longer afford to ignore Mahler; he had become too central to concert life, to 20th-century consciousness, and Bernstein had helped produce that shift. They spoke of touring together with the Vienna Philharmonic. I am moved by the thought of the two old men, rivalries and differences forgotten, murmuring to each other in a hotel room and conspiring to make music. Mahler had brought them together.\n\nA few days after struggling with the Vienna Philharmonic over Mahler’s Fifth in 1972, Bernstein performed and filmed the work with the orchestra in Vienna. The musicians are no longer holding back; it’s a very exciting performance (viewable on YouTube and streaming services). Fifteen years later, in 1987, Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic returned to the Fifth, taking it on tour. The performance in Frankfurt on September 8, 1987, was recorded live by Deutsche Grammophon and released the following year, and is also available to stream. It is widely considered the greatest recording of the symphony.\n\nBut it is not the greatest recording of the symphony. Two days later, on September 10, at the mammoth Royal Albert Hall in London, Bernstein and the orchestra played the work yet again. The BBC recorded the performance for radio broadcast, and though the recording (audio only) has never been commercially released, it has been posted on YouTube.\n\nThe symphony, in any performance, is a compound of despair, tenderness, and triumph. But in many performances, much of its detail can seem puzzling or pointless—vigorous or languorous notes spinning between the overwhelming climaxes. Bernstein clarifies and highlights everything, sometimes by slowing the music down so that one can hear and emotionally register such things as the utter forlornness of the funeral march in the first movement, the countermelodies in the strings that are close to heartbreak, the long silences and near silences in which the music struggles into being—struggles against the temptation of nothingness, which for Mahler was very real.\n\nFrom the June 1993 issue: Re-hearing Bernstein\n\nThe symphony now makes complete sense as an argument about the unstable nature of life. Toward the end of it, after a passage slowing the music almost to a halt, Mahler marks an abrupt tempo change: accelerando. In Bernstein’s personal score, he writes at this point, “GO.” Just … go. In London, the concluding pages—with the entire orchestra hurtling in a frenzy to the close—release an ovation in the hall that has the same intensity of joy as the music itself.\n\nMahler’s music is the dramatized projection of a Middle European, Jewish-outsider sensibility into the world. Bernstein carried the thrice-homeless Mahler home, yes, home to the world, where he now lives forever. The conductor may have been frustrated in some of his ambitions (he was never the classical composer he wanted to be), but he blended in his soul what he knew of Jewish sacred texts, Jewish family life and family feeling—blended all of that with the ready forms of the Broadway musical, the classical symphonic tradition, Christian choral music. He took advantage of new ways of reaching audiences—particularly television—without cheapening anything he had to say. He died too young at 72, dissatisfied, full of ideas and projects, a man still being formed; yet throughout his half-century career, he brought the richness of American Jewish sensibility into the minds and emotions of millions of people.\n\nThis article was adapted from David Denby’s new book, Eminent Jews: Bernstein, Brooks, Friedan, Mailer.

        "title": "Why Trump Says He’s ‘Not Joking’ About a Third Term",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s interest in seeking an unconstitutional third term as president, like many of his most dangerous or illegal ideas, began as a joke. Trump would muse on the stump that he deserved an extra term because he was robbed of his first (by Robert Mueller’s investigation) or his second (by imagined vote fraud in 2020) without quite clarifying his intent. But in an interview with NBC News this weekend, and then in remarks on Air Force One, Trump said he was completely serious about at least exploring the notion.\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” he told NBC, adding, “I’m not joking.” When he was asked if the method he envisioned was to have J. D. Vance run at the top of the ticket, and then pass the baton to Trump, he said, “That’s one.” Later, on Air Force One, reporters asked him if he intended to stay on beyond the end of his current term. “I’m not looking at that,” he replied, “but I’ll tell you, I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election, was totally rigged, so it’s actually sort of a fourth term.” When a reporter mentioned the Constitution’s prohibition, Trump brushed it off. “I don’t even want to talk about it,” he said. “I’m just telling you I have had more people saying, ‘Please run again.’ We have a long way to go before we even think about that, but I’ve had a lot of people.” In Trump’s mind, the timing is an impediment to declaring for a third term—it’s too early—but the Constitution is not.\n\nOne question is, does Trump seriously mean this? Perhaps not. Trump has a long-standing habit of answering reporters’ questions about future actions in the most open-ended way, refusing to commit to any specific course of action, which means he often refuses to rule out even the most outrageous things. This can give ammunition to his political opponents, such as when he said he would “look at” cuts to Medicare and Social Security. But it is also a way to “flood the zone with shit,” as Steve Bannon put it, by proposing an endless stream of wild ideas and reducing the shock effect of any of them.\n\nAnd Trump admires dictators, and enjoys the power that comes with serving as president. Having concluded that his first term failed because his enemies in the “deep state” and the independent media stopped him, he is now carrying out an elaborate set of schemes to sideline, control, and intimidate them. To concede that he will leave office in 2029 would reduce the atmosphere of menace he has cultivated. Why forfeit the power of another term, or at least the threat of one?\n\nAnother question is whether we should take this threat seriously. The Constitution is clear that he cannot run for a third term as president, and most scholars agree that running as a vice president, and then having the elected president step down, is not a valid loophole.\n\nBut as Trump has repeatedly demonstrated, questions of the law and the Constitution ultimately reduce to power struggles. If you hear somebody say Trump is not allowed to do something, the first question to ask is What’s the enforcement mechanism? The courts may be likely to rule against permitting him to run as either president or vice president. But such cases are unlikely to be decided until after the Republican convention has locked in the party’s choice, forcing the courts to choose between effectively canceling the presidential election and enforcing the Twenty-Second Amendment.\n\nWould five justices on the Supreme Court have the guts? Would the states follow such a ruling in a white-hot atmosphere where Republicans would accuse the judicial branch of nullifying democracy? Every apparently solid assumption about the inviolability of the two-term limit gets porous upon close inspection.\n\nOver the past eight years, in case after case, the protections that seemed to be hard laws have turned out to be softer norms. Trump has erased a series of norms by reimagining reality, first as a joke, and eventually in earnest.\n\nThere is a pattern to the way in which transgressive ideas occupy a liminal space in MAGA discourse between troll and policy platform. Trump has often floated running for a third term as a joke, and his supporters have repeated the joke as a way to indicate their own loyalty. The Conservative Political Action Conference in February featured a Trump 2028 sign, depicting the president in Roman imperial iconography, promoting a bid to amend the Constitution. That same month, The New York Times reported that “Trump’s advisers mock those who take his comments about a third term seriously, saying he has been trolling his critics with the idea of a permanent presidency since he launched his campaign to return to the White House.”\n\nThe notion of violating Canadian sovereignty likewise circulated on the right as a joking way to imagine Trump acting out imperial fantasies. Trump himself seemed to be in on the joke, repeatedly calling Canada the “51st state” and referring to its prime minister as “governor.” But more recently, he has crossed over into something closer to earnestness. His trade policies toward Canada have a more aggressive tinge than his general support for tariffs, and appear designed to collapse the country’s economy. Canadian officials reported alarm when Trump told them he refuses to accept the legitimacy of the border between the two countries.\n\nHe has likewise floated the idea of turning the Gaza Strip into an American-owned international resort, a campaign that includes sharing overtly ridiculous memes on social media, but also giving Israel’s government the green light to carry out a military operation that may well displace the Palestinian population.\n\nThese jokes, while frequently absurd and often genuinely funny, serve a serious purpose. They allow the most committed diehards to spread edgy new ideas, expanding the boundaries of the possible for Trump. But their initial humorous quality allows traditional Republicans to keep their distance. Slowly, though, the unthinkable becomes normalized, so that when the moment finally arrives, it feels inevitable.\n\nWhen Trump entertained questions on his plane about a third term, he had a faint smirk on his face, indicating that the idea hasn’t fully progressed from the joke phase into a plan of action. Trump turned the question into an opportunity to extol his alleged popularity—people are asking about another term, he says, because he is so successful and wonderful. Trump has always understood questions about his abuses of power as a kind of compliment. The prospect of smashing imagined limits on his power gives him an obvious thrill. He is probing, exploring. And when he finds softness, as he so often does when he presses against a supposed boundary, he presses on.",

        "title": "Russia’s Repression Goes South",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, more than 100,000 Russians have crossed the border with Georgia. While their country devolved into autocracy and spurned the West, their small southern neighbor seemed to be moving in the opposite direction—toward democracy and membership in the European Union.\n\nSoon, however, the authoritarianism they’d tried to escape began spilling over the border. The Kremlin appeared to exert greater influence over Georgia’s leaders, and Russian refugees saw their adoptive home come to resemble their native one.\n\n“Repressive laws that Georgia adopts are copied from the Kremlin’s,” Stanislav Dmitriyevsky, a human-rights activist who has served multiple prison sentences in Russia, told me, and Moscow’s brand of oppression is “catching up with Russian exiles.”\n\nIn 2006, Dmitriyevsky became the first activist that the Russian regime convicted under its so-called counter-extremism laws. But he didn’t decide to try to leave until the fall of 2022, when he found out that Russia’s Federal Security Service was investigating him for opposing the war in Ukraine.\n\nDmitriyevsky applied for asylum in Georgia, where he lived for two years awaiting a ruling. On New Year’s Eve, Georgian authorities denied his petition, explaining in a letter that “no facts of international or internal conflict or significant violations of human rights were recorded.” He was dumbfounded. “They must be blind,” Dmitriyevsky told me. He plans to appeal.\n\nRead: Democracy in Eastern Europe faces another crisis\n\nDmitriyevsky is one of a growing number of asylum seekers whom Georgia has rejected. In the first days of the war, the country mostly welcomed Russian refugees, but then it started closing itself off. Authorities interrogated border crossers, arrested some, and deported others to nearby Armenia. Russians who applied for permanent residency confronted increasing rates of rejection. And some of the Russians who made it across the border haven’t been able to stay, including those who face prison time back home.\n\nGeorgia’s evolving stance toward refugees mirrors the country’s recent turn away from the West. In December 2023, the European Council granted EU-candidate status to Georgia—a goal that the country’s leaders had long pursued. But late last year the ruling party, Georgian Dream, abruptly suspended accession talks.\n\nThat decision came after several indications that repression in Georgia was deepening. Earlier in 2024, the country’s Parliament had enacted a law requiring media companies and NGOs to register as “foreign agents” if more than 20 percent of their funding came from a “foreign power,” which was generally understood to mean any Western country. And in September, lawmakers passed legislation curtailing LGBTQ rights. Some Georgians followed the Russians’ example and went into exile themselves.\n\nGeorgia was once a refuge for the Russian opposition. In the first year of the war, thousands of activists crossed the border. Some founded NGOs, such as Volunteers Tbilisi, which organized aid for Ukrainian refugees—the kind of venture that would lead to a prison sentence in Russia. Georgia welcomed them initially but has since cooled to Putin’s opponents. In December, authorities blocked the Russian founder of Volunteers Tbilisi from returning to her home in Georgia.\n\nEven Russian visitors are having a hard time getting into Georgia. Several members of the protest group Pussy Riot tried to see their family members over the holidays, but Georgia denied them entry. The country’s border control also rebuffed Andrey Kurayev, a dissident priest whom the Kremlin has designated as a foreign agent, even though he was reportedly invited by a Georgian university.\n\nGeorgia’s realignment toward Moscow has been especially painful for Ivan Pavlov. A Russian lawyer, Pavlov moved his family to Georgia in September 2021, after the Federal Security Service opened a criminal case against him, seemingly because his firm had defended critics of Putin. Even though he’s Russian, Pavlov’s move to Georgia was a kind of homecoming: His mother was born in Tbilisi, where he spent time as a child. But in February 2023, he was forced out. “First Georgia banned entry to seven of my colleagues, and eventually canceled my residency permit on an order from counterintelligence,” Pavlov told me. “I was called a threat to national security.”\n\nRead: A wider war has already started in Europe\n\n“I don’t think authorities ban Russian exiles out of their love for Putin. They do it out of fear,” Pavlov said. He appealed to Georgia’s supreme court, which denied his petition to stay; his case is now pending before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nGeorgian authorities may be shirking their duties under international law, some advocates say. “They have obligations to give people in need the opportunity to apply for asylum,” Rachel Denber, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch, told me.\n\nAnna Rivina, a Russian women’s-rights activist, was rejected by Georgia, too. In February 2023, authorities kicked her out of the country after she had been there for eight months and registered her NGO, which provides support for women fleeing the war in Ukraine. “The reason is still classified, even after I have appealed to the supreme court,” Rivina told me. “I was told that my case fell under a law about terrorist activities. I am a threat to the nation in their view.” She was able to resettle in Western Europe, an option that many Russians don’t have.\n\nThe journalists Marfa Smirnova and Vladimir Romenskyi were able to get into Georgia, unlike Rivina, but given how quickly the country’s political situation has changed, the couple are not sure they’ll be able to stay. In Russia, they had reported on the country’s opposition movement for an independent television station. Now Smirnova regularly receives threats from anonymous users on Telegram. In 2023, somebody sent her photographs of her two children, who were visiting their grandparents in Russia during a school break. “When we travel in order to do reporting,” she told me, “we never know if we can get back home.”\n\nProtesters and police clash on the streets of Tbilisi every night, a reminder to Dmitriyevsky, the human-rights activist, of the repressive politics he escaped in Russia. On a recent Sunday evening, he watched as law-enforcement officers beat demonstrators until they fell to the ground. He told me he felt a “powerful sense of déjà vu” as riot police dragged dozens of them away—a scene he’d witnessed in Russia many times.\n\nWhen Dmitriyevsky first arrived in Georgia, he welcomed recent anti-corruption reforms in law enforcement. Now he avoids the police whenever he can. He’s worried that they’ll target him, as they have other opposition activists. Last month, Georgia detained two Russian opposition activists, who allege that police planted drugs on them. “I don’t want to run away from Georgia,” Dmitriyevsky said. “If we run from every authoritarian regime, we’d have to move to the moon soon.”",

        "title": "The Best American Poetry of the 21st Century (So Far)",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Poetry in the 21st century is both ubiquitous and oddly peripheral. Verses are displayed on subway walls, recited on momentous occasions, and served up in giant fonts on social media, but rarely do they merit a book review or a position on end-of-year reading lists. Yet the medium evolves even when it isn’t the center of attention, and over the past 25 years, its authors have pursued astonishing new forms and reinvented old ones. The Atlantic has prized and published poetry since its founding in 1857. And so, a quarter of the way into this new century of cataclysmic change, we thought it was an apt time to consider how poets fit into the broader conversation—to document an emerging canon of the most significant verse of the century so far.\n\nNo list can be comprehensive or infallible, but we did not approach this one lightly. After considering various criteria, we landed on work that felt consequential. We were looking for poetry that had struck its readers, for whatever reasons, as unforgettable, enduring, and influential: maybe because it came as an unexpected gift from a friend or loved one, or in the form of a classroom discovery; maybe because it reframed the world in such a way that culture or society felt foundationally shaken. Maybe it was just because, to paraphrase Emily Dickinson, it takes the top of your head off.\n\n↓ Jump to the list here\n\nTo establish a consensus, we consulted with more than 450 people—poets and fiction writers, but also publishers, editors, and informed readers from a variety of fields—asking them to name 10 books apiece. Together, they cast nearly 1,000 votes and recommended more than 400 collections of verse. Finally, we limited the list to Americans: Asking 25 books to represent 25 years of artistic progress within the many traditions that feed into American poetry was difficult enough.\n\nFor all the variety that emerged in this process, the collections below have a striking amount in common. These poems share a sense of urgency that reflects the overwhelmingly stressful events swirling around them—matters of war, race, gender, politics, health, immigration, climate change, rule, and misrule. Many of them mix genres and media in ways that were rare before 2000. Building on 20th-century innovations within confessional and prose poetry, they have melded lyric verse with memoir and essay, poetry with prose, official documents with photographs, video stills, and paintings. These poets have not walled themselves off from a world that has grown more fragmented, hybridized, and image driven. They have let it in, and allowed it to enrich their work and open up new pathways for younger writers.\n\nIn the previous century, the poet Derek Walcott invoked the image of a broken vase that is reassembled with a love “stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when it was whole.” His metaphor certainly encompasses this new canon, but it also describes an ongoing tradition. Poetry has always assembled and disassembled—and reassembled—in all kinds of magical and necessary ways. — Daniel Halpern and Walt Hunter\n\n25\n\nTo 2040\n\nBy Jorie Graham\n\n“Are we / extinct yet. Who owns / the map. May I / look”: Blending question and proposition, the opening lines of Graham’s To 2040 stake out the ambitious scope and elegiac spirit of the poet’s foray into a near future. Her 15th collection reflects on a natural world under siege, fading human memories of a once-bounteous Earth, and the poet’s own failing body. As in Graham’s earlier work, the changing terrain—both planetary and personal—demands fierce attention. Her signature long lines track the speaker’s mind as it registers difficulty and darkness: that “the quiet / before the storm is / the storm,” that “the claw full of hair” on a shower ledge is “such a surprise.” Lyric moments arrive in short lines and brief stanzas: “The fish the / water the sand the / needle in the pine. The here. Hear it / breathing.” Don’t expect a map. Instead, the poet summons readers to “look behind you, turn, look down as much as you can, notice all / that disappears.”\n\nTo 2040 By Jorie Graham\n\n24\n\nDon’t Call Us Dead\n\nBy Danez Smith\n\nHow fragile is the wall between life and death? Smith’s writing asks the question again and again. “every day is a funeral & a miracle,” one of the works in this collection announces with the confidence of a proverb. For the Black, queer speaker, the possibility of death is a constant companion: “hallelujah! today i rode / past five police cars / & i can tell you about it.” In that poem’s first stanza, Smith introduces an unsettling image: “on the bad nights, i wake to my mother / shoveling dirt down my throat / i scream mom! i’m alive! i’m alive! / but it just sounds like dirt.” This is not the account of a natural demise, but Smith relays the harrowing sense that its untimely arrival was inevitable. Life is not just a miracle in the biblical sense, then, but a commodity often denied to the people once sold as cargo themselves. With a clear reverence for both the living and those who have passed on, Don’t Call Us Dead weaves together history, intensely personal revelations, and Smith’s audacious visions of a safer future for us all.\n\nDon’t Call Us Dead By Danez Smith\n\n23\n\nThe Shadow of Sirius\n\nBy W. S. Merwin\n\nMerwin implores us to see that “the past is not finished / here in the present / it is awake the whole time.” The poet’s recollections include the texture of his mother’s hand at the piano, the image of an old dog running in the hills “like an unmoored flame,” the graciousness of a roofer named Duporte, now long dead. But the act of remembering always takes place amid natural as well as personal history: Merwin’s poetry has an ecological awareness that he sharpened through decades of work restoring and conserving palm trees in Hawaii. His careful stewardship of local flora helps make these poems’ descriptions—of the passing days and returning seasons; of birds and trees; of his wife, Paula, and the life they made together—tangible. That same tactile quality is what makes these verses’ sadness at the finality of loss so pointed.\n\nThe Shadow of Sirius By W. S. Merwin\n\n22\n\nNox\n\nBy Anne Carson\n\nThe uncontainable grief animating Nox is mirrored in its presentation: not a bound book, but a sinuous, accordion-folded pamphlet spilling out of its box, simulating the notebook that Carson assembled after the death of her distant brother, Michael. “WHO WERE YOU,” Nox cries out. That anguished scribble appears among photographs, handwritten notes, and typed thoughts. Beside these are cards defining and investigating Latin words; Carson, a classicist, is at the same time attempting to translate a poem by the Roman poet Catullus about his brother, who also died far from home. This magpie’s collection of ideas and images conveys that there is no clear, unbroken story to tell about a brother whom Carson hardly knew as an adult. She is aware that these emotions have been felt before, but that doesn’t diminish her sorrow. She pulls on the thread that connects her to Catullus and a community of mourners as old as human history, one that we all belong to or will eventually join.\n\nNox By Anne Carson\n\n21\n\nLife on Mars\n\nBy Tracy K. Smith\n\nSmith, a former poet laureate of the United States, is deeply concerned with history and place. Yet she begins Life on Mars by imagining a completely new, futuristic world, in which humans sail along “in the haze of space” among chrome aesthetics and “clean lines pointed only forward.” In this science-fiction universe, “history, with its hard spine & dog-eared / Corners, will be replaced by nuance.” The trappings of the genre allow Smith to conjure a life unmoored from what came before—but briefly: It turns out that space isn’t all that far from home. Smith soon starts writing about her father, an engineer who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, and orbits the massive, superdense hole left by his death, while clinging to moments of beauty and a kind of agnostic optimism. In one poem, the victims of high-profile murders write postcards to their assailants from some unknown hereafter. In another, which imagines her father’s “ride beyond the body,” Smith muses hopefully that “he is only gone so far as we can tell.”\n\nLife on Mars By Tracy K. Smith\n\n20\n\nOne With Others\n\nBy C. D. Wright\n\nIn a town Wright calls Big Tree, Arkansas, in the late 1960s, a group of Black schoolchildren were arrested and detained in a dry swimming pool for staging a walkout from their all-Black school. Wright, who was born in the region, stitches together found materials from locals, reconstructing “the memories summoned and branded into their histories” to form a kind of poetic documentary. She creates a particularly vivid picture of V, a white woman whose full name was Margaret Kaelin McHugh—someone who “woke up in a rage, eight days a week” and was so horrified by the event that she later joined a civil-rights march to Little Rock. In response, she was violently expelled from her family and community. One With Others is an experimental collage of voices that becomes a groundbreaking testament—a record of small-town racism and an elegiac biography of a flawed, courageous individual.\n\nOne With Others By C. D. Wright\n\n19\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem\n\nBy Natalie Diaz\n\nSince 1754, when Benjamin Franklin published a political cartoon imploring the American colonies to “JOIN, or DIE,” the rattlesnake has been “a classic American character in a classic American font,” as Diaz puts it in her poem “Snake-Light.” Franklin’s image referenced folklore that suggested a cut-up snake would be reanimated if its parts were reunited before sunset. But in Postcolonial Love Poem, the brutality committed in the name of our nation’s founding has not healed. Diaz, an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian Community, refracts our country’s origin story through the blood of its chosen sacrifices, the rattlesnake just one among many. The Mojave poet’s collection is awash in scenes of conquest, depletion, and profound yearning; animals perish, rivers dry up, people burn with lust for one another in the absence of other sustenance. Yet each of the poems feels alive, pointing to the fact that our foundational myths can still be reconsidered—and that Indigenous people are still here to rewrite them.\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem By Natalie Diaz\n\n18\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude\n\nBy Ross Gay\n\nSweetness recurs in Gay’s collection, in the form of abundant fruit—figs, pears, berries—and in the dominant emotion of these poems: joy. Here, even death is transformed into the syrupy juice of a stone fruit dripping down a chin. Gay describes sprinkling his father’s ashes at the base of a tree and then finding the dead man’s spirit transferred into its bounty, “almost dancing now in the plum, / in the tree, the way he did as a person.” The poems are redolent of spring, full of verdant growth and birdsong. Perhaps such happy poetry shouldn’t be so unusual, but Gay’s odes to such everyday pleasures as sleeping in his clothes or drinking water from his hands bring a rare satisfaction. “Friends this is the realest place I know, / it makes me squirm like a worm I am so grateful,” he writes in one poem, and this sentiment captures it all, both the cheerful squirming and the gratitude simply for being alive.\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude By Ross Gay\n\n17\n\nBright Dead Things\n\nBy Ada Limón\n\nThe best way to describe Limón’s poetry, perhaps, is saturated: Emotions run through it undiluted and her language is simple, yet full to bursting. Bright Dead Things is laced with these qualities. “I am beautiful. I am full of love. I am dying,” she writes in one of several poems about the death of her stepmother. Repeatedly in these pages, Limón plays with scope and blunt imagery to produce moments of humanistic insight. The physicality of illness, rendered almost dryly and at industrial scale, becomes strangely moving: “Her job, / her work, was to let the machine / of survival break down, / make the factory fail.” A detail about a partner’s preference for “a lot of washcloths, / the small, cheap kind / for every day you’re alive” turns the most domestic of predilections into a memento of a life lived in tandem. Limón’s great gift is her bracing comfort with being earnest. “I’m thirty-five and remember all that I’ve done wrong,” she writes at one point, reminding us that her plainspoken observations are a form of generosity.\n\nBright Dead Things By Ada Limón\n\n16\n\nLook\n\nBy Solmaz Sharif\n\nUsing the Department of Defense’s Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms to deliver a fierce critique of America’s War on Terror, Sharif deploys terms such as hostile environment and diversion in surprising ways. Sometimes these reclamations have nothing to do with war; they crop up, for instance, in reflections on a dinner party, or during a swim in a friend’s father’s pool. The appropriated words, distinguished in the text in small caps, shed light on the euphemistic, sterile language used to describe the atrocities of combat. Sharif’s poems also examine how violence can carve out gaping holes in language. A series of seven poems in the middle of Look appear as doctored letters from a woman to her husband, who is being detained in Guantánamo. These verses of love and pining are made more devastating by the absences they contain; their redactions reflect the blank space the speaker’s husband left behind. Sharif demands that her readers—especially Americans who live thousands of miles away from the destruction—stare directly at the costs of war.\n\nLook By Solmaz Sharif\n\n15\n\nSlow Lightning\n\nBy Eduardo C. Corral\n\nSlow Lightning evokes the U.S.-Mexico border and the difficulties of undocumented life as if they exist on a liminal plane; deserts, snakes, lovers, and cacti recur throughout, as does the notion of living in between. One poem, dedicated to Frida Kahlo’s painting The Broken Column, moves between eagle-eyed analysis of Kahlo’s artistry and musings on the perfect shade of red. Like Kahlo’s work, Corral’s verse is shaped with a painterly eye: His lines are more impressionistic than narrative, as if he’s stringing together images with thin, wispy brush strokes. Nothing is static here: Humor is invoked to mask suffering. “Sapo shits behind a cluster of nopales,” Corral writes in a poem about two friends crossing the border, “& shouts out our favorite joke, No tengo papeles!” (“I don’t have papers.”) Sometimes lines are peppered across the page, instead of beginning by the left margin; other times a whole poem is turned sideways. English sentences slip into Spanish. The result is a collection that tells no tidy stories, dropping readers instead into a swirling, shadowy dream world.\n\nSlow Lightning By Eduardo C. Corral\n\n14\n\nThe Tradition\n\nBy Jericho Brown\n\nIn The Tradition, Brown catalogs the ills of American society—police brutality, mass shootings—and immerses the reader in the physical pain that they cause, bringing up images of wounds dressed with tar and bullets tucked in brain folds. His precise and spare language leaves little room for error, a credit to the poet’s power. Appearing sporadically in the collection are a series of poems called duplexes—a form Brown invented as a way of “gutting” the traditional sonnet by mixing in the blues and the Arabic ghazal. Each duplex is composed of seven couplets in which the first line of each pair echoes and twists the second line of the previous one: “Men roam shirtless as if none ever hurt me. / Men roam that myth. In truth, one hurt me.” Often, the last line of the poem also folds back into the very first. Through this construction, Brown hints at the cyclical nature of American progress: Stepping forward, in the duplex, is always accompanied by a step back.\n\nThe Tradition By Jericho Brown\n\n13\n\nMan and Camel\n\nBy Mark Strand\n\nThis book starts with a series of fables that a grandmother might tell to a tired child: There’s a king who no longer wants to rule; a man who goes to pick up a cake and never comes home; a polar explorer who encounters a spectral figure he seems to know; a camel who sings. These are followed by a concluding set of personal meditations that riff on the seven sayings of Christ on the cross. Each of these somnolent vignettes immerses us in a world from which the meaning seems to have escaped just a short time ago, leaving behind a somber landscape of tantalizing symbols: “If the moon could speak, what would it say? / If the moon could speak, it would say nothing.” Death and loss color the tone and texture of the poems, but Strand still gives his visions a cryptic, enthralling beauty. Take the final poem’s descent to a moonlit sea: “a place of constant beginning that has within it / what no eye has seen.”\n\nMan and Camel By Mark Strand\n\n12\n\nOlio\n\nBy Tyehimba Jess\n\nOlio—the word refers to the second half of a minstrel show, a variety act that eventually became known as vaudeville—features more than a dozen real and fictional Black musicians, all of whom are the first generation of their family not to be enslaved. These artists, including Scott Joplin, the ragtime piano player, are caught at the intersection between Black art-making and white profiteering. Jess’s songbook contains sonnets, interviews, letters, pages to unfold and tear out, and forms of the poet’s own invention, such as the “duet” poems that stage two voices in parallel columns of text. Olio’s virtuosic spectacle is a performance put together as carefully as any of its characters’ work. As a whole, it examines art’s sometimes-uneasy, ambiguous relationship to freedom.\n\nOlio By Tyehimba Jess\n\n11\n\nStag’s Leap\n\nBy Sharon Olds\n\nBy 2012, when Olds published this collection about her husband leaving her, she’d already been divorced for more than 10 years. Yet the marriage had lasted more than 30, meaning she had a lot left to unpack. Stag’s Leap traces the long arc of her own healing, vacillating among disbelief, shame, nostalgia, and gratitude. Olds is remarkably generous to her ex: “When anyone escapes, my heart / leaps up,” she writes in the title poem. “Even when it’s I who am escaped from, / I am half on the side of the leaver.” But she’s gentle with herself, too, holding her heartache up to the light with nonjudgmental curiosity. Olds comes away with a profound, and widely applicable, reflection about the impossibility of truly knowing someone at all—and the sometimes-foolhardy bravery required to try anyway. These poems are a perfect example of what Olds does best: She makes you blush, then laugh, then cry.\n\nStag’s Leap By Sharon Olds\n\n10\n\nfrank: sonnets\n\nBy Diane Seuss\n\nSonnets impose a welcome constraint on poetry, which Seuss takes as a challenge, stretching the form to its limits across 127 poems. In languid sentences, Seuss manages to fit a full life into her book, collecting snippets from her midwestern childhood and her youthful romps in New York City. Her poems squint and fearlessly examine death: She writes of her father’s tumor, her son’s life-threatening struggles with addiction, and the early demise of a cherished friend. These events lead Seuss to think on her own mortality, yet her ontological probing is balanced by an awe for the minutiae of modern human life. She might describe a house as “covered in the pollen / of Cheetos dust.” She devotes as much reverence to poetic abstractions as to quotidian details such as Q-tips, Jack Nicholson in Chinatown, or “chips, dip, pizza rolls.” Over time, she comes to view the end with more wonder than terror. As she writes in the book’s final sonnet: “When it happens I don’t want to be afraid I / want to be curious.”\n\nfrank: sonnets By Diane Seuss\n\n9\n\nDeaf Republic\n\nBy Ilya Kaminsky\n\nAt the beginning of the play-in-verse that largely makes up Deaf Republic, soldiers enter a square in the fictional town of Vasenka, in an unidentified country perhaps inspired by Kaminsky’s own childhood in Soviet Ukraine. People have gathered to watch a puppet show, and as soldiers attempt to disperse the crowd, a deaf boy is shot. The next day, the townspeople adopt deafness in protest; they refuse to hear the soldiers, and they develop their own sign language, illustrated in drawings throughout the collection. “The deaf don’t believe in silence,” Kaminsky, himself hard of hearing, writes. “Silence is the invention of the hearing.” Soldiers “arrive in Vasenka to ‘protect our freedom,’ speaking a language no one understands.” And yet there is love, joy, tenderness—a newlywed couple welcoming a baby, the baby learning to walk. Bookending the two-act play are two poems set in the United States, where Kaminsky lives now as a citizen—and where many, too, wrestle with the power and protection found in silences, chosen or imposed.\n\nDeaf Republic By Ilya Kaminsky\n\n8\n\nTime and Materials\n\nBy Robert Hass\n\nBefore this collection, much of Hass’s work focused on concrete, everyday details: seasons, scents, sex, changing light, singing birds. Time and Materials is both different and not. Hass is still concerned with the immediate, but also with how the small scenes he’s mastered are the building blocks of even the most lofty and abstract concepts. In one poem, he marvels at Vermeer’s famous painting The Milkmaid—how incredibly alive those “thin strips of paint on three hundred year old canvas” are—and then flits to describing a lover: the vein in her neck, the small hairs on her lower back. He is creating something like a portrait. His point isn’t only to separate major ideas into their constituent pieces; rather, he wonders at how the world manages to be so much greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps he’s defending, too, writing that interests itself not only in “time” but in “materials”—the stuff from which existence is built.\n\nTime and Materials By Robert Hass\n\n7\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night\n\nBy Louise Glück\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night is the culmination of Glück’s long and lauded career: a collection of poems by a woman in her early 70s, looking back at life with the clarifying vision that time can bring. What Glück sees first is childhood, its innocent joys, “sheets printed with colored sailboats,” birds and insects, summer days. Then, as the loop of years closes, she also sees old age, its frailties and confusions, its finalities—“It came to me one night as I was falling asleep / that I had finished with those amorous adventures / to which I had long been a slave.” Many of the poems shimmer as if illuminated by moonlight, dreamy and ruminative. She is taking account of the ephemerality of human existence, and in one poem, an airplane ride becomes a metaphor for an entire life. Near its end: “I will be brief. This concludes, / as the stewardess says / our short flight. / And all the persons one will never know / crowd into the aisle, and all are funneled / into the terminal.”\n\nFaithful and Virtuous Night By Louise Glück\n\n6\n\nCrush\n\nBy Richard Siken\n\nInfatuation is one of life’s glorious mysteries: At peak intensity, it can spin out of control, teetering from beautiful to frightening. This might be the double meaning of Crush, Siken’s poetry collection about longing: Like a volcano, desire is awesome but destructive. Siken describes it at times as a source of stigma, self-hatred, or material danger. “The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater / because he is trying to kill you / and you deserve it,” he writes, “because you wanted to touch his hands and lips.” But the only greater threat than love’s power is the possibility that it’s not powerful enough—that it can’t stop time, or overwrite humankind’s mundane cruelties. Siken is a patron saint for those who feel deeply, and he lays it all out, raw but tender, in the first poem: “Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake / and dress them in warm clothes again … Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. / These, our bodies, possessed by light. / Tell me we’ll never get used to it.”\n\nCrush By Richard Siken\n\n5\n\nWhereas\n\nBy Layli Long Soldier\n\n“Everything is in the language we use,” Long Soldier notes in Whereas. “For example, a treaty is … a contract between two sovereign nations.” But treaties between the United States and Native nations failed to recognize the equal footing inherent to that definition, she reminds us. In the first part of this meticulous collection, Long Soldier defines and redefines words in English and Lakota, approaching both tongues with modesty and immense care. In the second, she offers a point-by-point response to a 2009 governmental “Resolution of Apology to Native Peoples,” mirroring its “whereas” statements, which, as she demonstrates, claim to establish facts but instead obscure them. She uses erasure to excise words, either to reveal their emptiness or to build truer sentences, resulting in lines such as “I recognize that official ill-breaking of the Indian”; at another point, she interposes her father’s contrition to show you what a proper apology looks like. “I climb the backs of languages, ride them to exhaustion,” she writes with wry self-recognition. What she mostly does, though, is bring dead language back to life.\n\nWhereas By Layli Long Soldier\n\n4\n\nNative Guard\n\nBy Natasha Trethewey\n\nThe title poem in Trethewey’s book, named for a unit of Black soldiers called into Union service during the Civil War, transports readers back to November 1862, when the regiment was guarding Confederate captives on a Mississippi island. Even while heading into combat, Trethewey’s formerly enslaved narrator is concerned with keeping alive lessons from the past: “I thought to carry with me / want of freedom though I had been freed, / remembrance not constant recollection.” More than a century later, in the mid-1960s, Trethewey was born on the mainland, about 12 miles from that same Union fort. Native Guard is at once an elegy for these often-forgotten Black men and an intimate meditation on how the Civil War and the legacy of slavery shaped Trethewey’s early life. The book travels back and forth in time, sometimes in the span of one poem, and the author opts to converse directly with the soldiers or with her late mother, whose interracial marriage was still illegal at the time of Trethewey’s birth. Native Guard rejects the comfort of linear storytelling, offering a more honest, visceral account in its place.\n\nNative Guard By Natasha Trethewey\n\n3\n\nNight Sky With Exit Wounds\n\nBy Ocean Vuong\n\nVuong’s collection depicts scenes of obliterating violence and juxtaposes them with the deep, human desire to survive. Night Sky With Exit Wounds moves across years and the globe, traversing the sidewalks of Saigon and the cornfields of America, always pairing brutality with mundanity: Pigeons peck at bread near a bombed bakery, monarch butterflies fly through a prison cell. Vuong approaches language without pretense and treats it anew each time. He delights in surprising turns of phrase, branching into different worlds, often within the same poem or even the same line. Specific words—tongue, snow, holy, body, country, colt—repeat and re-form themselves among poems, taking on multiple meanings or calling back to earlier moments. His work reminds us that beauty can come from suffering, and that, sometimes, the two blend together.\n\nNight Sky With Exit Wounds By Ocean Vuong\n\n2\n\nAmerican Sonnets for my Past and Future Assassin\n\nBy Terrance Hayes\n\nHayes wrote this collection shortly after Donald Trump’s first electoral victory, and nearly every page is imbued with his emotional response as he catalogs his anger, fear, ambivalence, and even, at times, love. Each of these 70 poems is titled “American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin,” and each uses its stark, metered lines to contend with the country’s present and historical bigotry. In some of the sonnets, Hayes confronts the “assassin,” a figure who takes many forms—white supremacists such as Dylann Roof, or the men whose faces appear on the money he carries. “You will never assassinate my ghosts,” he writes. The book also includes gentler verse; in one sonnet Hayes writes about the “things I love in the face / Of James Baldwin … The sashay / Between left & right / eyebrow, for example.” In another, he notes with quiet pride that he learned to cut his own hair after his father left. But even these poems feel like they’re on the edge of violence, almost bursting out of their contained form. His collection is a powerful record of a turning point in American history and an argument that the insidious “assassin” of the poems can look like anyone—even ourselves.\n\nAmerican Sonnets for my Past and Future Assassin By Terrance Hayes\n\n1\n\nCitizen\n\nBy Claudia Rankine\n\nMany parts of Citizen, Rankine’s “American Lyric,” might not initially register as poetry: video stills, paintings, photographs, long sections of prose. But they function as poetry because they distill a universe of history, experience, thought, and feeling into a taut whole. Rankine presents future writers with a menu of techniques for turning the media of the moment into poetry that addresses both the urgent and the eternal. When describing hostile, racist comments or police brutality, she uses the second person to expand the lyric form, traditionally personal and confessional, into a means of holding an array of stories, many (or maybe most) of them not her own: “You are not sick, you are injured,” she says, invoking racism’s effects on the body while focusing on those doing the harm. Between these episodes are interludes of airier verse that soars or sighs. At first, the “you” of the book holds her tongue in response to many slights, seeking solace in, for example, a tennis match—only to see Serena Williams lash out over a bad call after years of forbearance. The poet, like the player, ultimately repudiates the silencing impulse: “The world is wrong. You can’t put the past behind you. It’s buried in you.” Tension builds and then explodes. But beauty also abounds—moonlight, rain, a partner’s touch, and the pleasure of a few words, perfectly arranged.\n\nCitizen: An American Lyric By Claudia Rankine",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration says that it mistakenly deported an immigrant with protected status but that courts are powerless to order his return.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged in a court filing Monday that it had grabbed a Maryland father with protected legal status and mistakenly deported him to El Salvador, but said that U.S. courts lack jurisdiction to order his return from the megaprison where he’s now locked up.\n\nThe case appears to be the first time the Trump administration has admitted to errors when it sent three planeloads of Salvadoran and Venezuelan deportees to El Salvador’s grim “Terrorism Confinement Center” on March 15. Attorneys for several Venezuelan deportees have said that the Trump administration falsely labeled their clients as gang members because of their tattoos. Trump officials have disputed those claims.\n\nBut in Monday’s court filing, attorneys for the government admitted that the Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been deported accidentally. “Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error,” the government told the court. Trump lawyers said the court has no ability to bring Abrego Garcia back now that he is in Salvadoran custody.\n\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s attorney, said he’s never seen a case in which the government knowingly deported someone who had already received protected legal status from an immigration judge. He is asking the court to order the Trump administration to ask for Abrego Garcia’s return and, if necessary, to withhold payment to the Salvadoran government, which says it’s charging the United States $6 million a year to jail U.S. deportees.\n\nTrump-administration attorneys told the court to dismiss the request on multiple grounds, including that Trump’s “primacy in foreign affairs” outweighs the interests of Abrego Garcia and his family.\n\n“They claim that the court is powerless to order any relief,’’ Sandoval-Moshenberg told me. “If that’s true, the immigration laws are meaningless—all of them—because the government can deport whoever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want, and no court can do anything about it once it’s done.”\n\nCourt filings show that Abrego Garcia came to the United States at age 16 in 2011 after fleeing gang threats in his native El Salvador. In 2019 he received a form of protected legal status known as “withholding of removal” from a U.S. immigration judge who found he would likely be targeted by gangs if deported back.\n\nAbrego Garcia, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a 5-year-old disabled child who is also a U.S. citizen, has no criminal record in the United States, according to his attorney. The Trump administration does not claim he has a criminal record, but called him a “danger to the community” and an active member of MS-13, the Salvadoran gang that Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg said that those charges are false, and that the gang label stems from a 2019 incident when Abrego Garcia and three other men were detained in a Home Depot parking lot by a police detective in Prince George’s County, Maryland. During questioning, one of the men told officers that Abrego Garcia was a gang member, but the man offered no proof and police said they didn’t believe him, filings show. Police did not identify him as a gang member.\n\nAbrego Garcia was not charged with a crime, but he was handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the arrest to face deportation. In those proceedings, the government claimed that a reliable informant had identified him as a ranking member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia and his family hired an attorney and fought the government’s attempt to deport him. He received “withholding of removal” six months later, a protected status.\n\nIt is not a path to permanent U.S. residency, but it means the government won’t deport him back to his home country, because he’s more likely than not to face harm there.\n\nAbrego Garcia has had no contact with any law-enforcement agency since his release, according to his attorney. He works full time as a union sheet-metal apprentice, has complied with requirements to check in annually with ICE, and cares for his 5-year-old son, who has autism and a hearing defect, and is unable to communicate verbally.\n\nLeft: Abrego Garcia. Right: Garcia at CECOT. (U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.)\n\nOn March 12, Abrego Garcia had picked up his son after work from the boy’s grandmother’s house when ICE officers stopped the car, saying his protected status had changed. Officers waited for Abrego Garcia’s wife to come to the scene and take care of the boy, then drove him away in handcuffs. Within two days, he had been transferred to an ICE staging facility in Texas, along with other detainees the government was preparing to send to El Salvador. Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and the government planned to deport two planeloads of Venezuelans along with a separate group of Salvadorans.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s family has had no contact with him since he was sent to the megaprison in El Salvador, known as CECOT. His wife spotted her husband in news photographs released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on the morning of March 16, after a U.S. district judge had told the Trump administration to halt the flights.\n\n“Oopsie,” Bukele wrote on social media, taunting the judge.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s wife recognized her husband’s decorative arm tattoo and scars, according to the court filing. The image showed Salvadoran guards in black ski masks frog-marching him into the prison, with his head shoved down toward the floor. CECOT is the same prison that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited last week, recording videos for social media while standing in front of a cell packed with silent detainees.\n\nIf the government wants to deport someone with protected status, the standard course would be to reopen the case and introduce new evidence arguing for deportation. The deportation of a protected-status holder has even stunned some government attorneys I’ve been in touch with who are tracking the case, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. “What. The. Fuck,” one texted me.\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg told the court that he believes Trump officials deported his client “through extrajudicial means because they believed that going through the immigration judge process took too long, and they feared that they might not win all of their cases.’’\n\nOfficials at ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Monday court filing by the government indicates that officials knew Abrego Garcia had legal protections shielding him from deportation to El Salvador.\n\n“ICE was aware of this grant of withholding of removal at the time [of] Abrego Garcia’s removal from the United States. Reference was made to this status on internal forms,” the government told the court in its filing.\n\nAbrego Garcia was not on the initial manifest of the deportation flight, but was listed “as an alternate,” the government attorneys explained. As other detainees were removed from the flight for various reasons, Abrego Garcia “moved up the list.’’\n\nThe flight manifest “did not indicate that Abrego Garcia should not be removed,’’ the attorneys said. “Through administrative error, Abrego Garcia was removed from the United States to El Salvador. This was an oversight.” But despite this, they told the court that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was carried out ‘’in good faith.’’",

        "title": "The Drink Americans Can’t Quit",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "A young woman is at a diner with friends, being stared down by a waitress with frosted lipstick and no time to waste. What she wants is a soda—but for whatever reason, she can’t bring herself to have one. Same with the girl at the pool party, and the one at the drive-through, and the one sitting in what looks like a sorority house, and the guy at the convenience store. Their brows are furrowed, their mouths are pouty, their faces are twisted into ever-more over-the-top expressions of longing and ambivalence. Their friends are getting so annoyed with them. Eventually, the solution to a problem invented within the space of 40 seconds: “Stop spiraling! Get a Poppi!”\n\nI’ve now watched this ad, which ran during this year’s Super Bowl, six times, and I still cannot say I fully understand it. Its premise is that people are somehow tortured, or embarrassed, by the idea of drinking soda—something that the president, Dua Lipa, and millions of Americans do regularly, seemingly without great turmoil. The solution, the ad argues, is Poppi, which is largely indistinguishable from soda, the very thing that was supposedly shameful in the first place: It’s a carbonated, sweetened, canned beverage, available in flavors including root beer, cherry cola, and grape—the type of drink that, despite years of anti-soda rhetoric and Poppi’s vision of collective psychosis, Americans simply cannot quit. In an interview, Neal Baer, a pediatrician who has taught a class called “Soda Politics” at Yale’s School of Public Health, was frank: “It’s old soda in new cans.”\n\nRead: The most miraculous—and overlooked—type of milk\n\nPoppi contains significantly less sugar than standard sodas—five grams, or about a teaspoon, per can, compared with Coke’s 39—as well as stevia, a calorie-free, plant-based sweetener, and inulin, a type of soluble fiber derived, in this case, from agave. This is what allows Poppi to sell itself as a healthier, anxiety-free kind of not-soda soda, and what makes it the perfect beverage for a country that loves talking about how bad soda is almost as much as we love drinking it. In 2024, the company sold more than half a billion dollars’ worth of Poppis. Last week, it was acquired by PepsiCo (notably a soda company) for just under $2 billion.\n\nFor much of the past two decades, soda was—if not the kind of thing you’d hide in the bottom of your recycling bin, as one particularly confusing piece of Poppi marketing copy puts it—suffering a bit of a reputation problem. This is because soda is really not good for you: It generally contains a ton of sugar and no vitamins, and also the bubbles are bad for your teeth. So it was shunned, taxed, and villainized, likened to cigarettes and made a synecdoche for America’s broken food system, in which empty calories are easier and cheaper to obtain than nutritionally dense foods. School districts banned its sale. Television stations ran PSAs against it. The nutritionist Marion Nestle wrote an entire book about it, Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (And Winning).\n\nThe coalition of nutritionists, public-health experts, legislators, and consumer advocates who took on Big Soda did win—to some degree. After climbing steadily starting in the 1960s, sales of full-calorie soda decreased by about 25 percent from 1995 to 2015. But in gross terms, Americans were still consuming a lot of sugary drinks: They may have been turning away from traditional soda, but they were turning toward sweetened coffee and tea, energy drinks, sports drinks, dirty soda, and boba. From 2011 to 2014, roughly half of American adults and 63 percent of American teens were drinking a sugary drink on any given day. By 2017, consumption had plateaued. Last year, both Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper sold more cans of soda than they had the year before.\n\nNow the second-wave sodas have come for us. In November, Walmart announced an entirely new category: “modern soda,” which is distinct from traditional soda and usually more expensive. It includes drinks such as Poppi, as well as its biggest competitor, Olipop, which, like Poppi, comes in spunky, modern-looking cans and a variety of nostalgic and new flavors, and which also contains inulin and less sugar. Coca-Cola, looking to compete, recently started selling its own version of second-wave soda, called Simply Pop.\n\nRead: Starbucks’ most beloved offering is disappearing\n\nThese drinks are, without question, “far healthier than regular, full-sugar sodas,” Caitlin Dow, a senior nutrition scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told me in an email. They’re also probably better than many diet sodas, which are typically made with possibly carcinogenic sweeteners such as aspartame. But, Baer told me, they’re still what nutritionists call sugar-sweetened beverages. “That is not good for you.”\n\nAnd the science on inulin, Poppi and Olipop’s other big sell, is “pretty meh,” Dow told me: These fibers do increase one specific kind of bacteria in the gut, she wrote, though there’s no strong evidence that doing that “actually translates to better gut health … or any other kind of health. But the evidence is VERY clear that inulin makes people gassy. (Shockingly, companies don’t seem to brag about that finding.)” In May, Poppi settled for nearly $9 million a class-action lawsuit brought by a California woman who objected to the company’s health claims; Poppi did not acknowledge any fault, liability, or wrongdoing. Ultimately, Dow wrote, the claims made by Poppi and the like are “largely a marketing ploy” designed to “separate health-conscious consumers from their money.”\n\nIn this sense, these drinks really are like soda, which is, and always has been, a miracle of marketing. “It’s an amazing story,” Baer told me—a remarkably unhealthy, nutritionally inessential product that costs pennies to make but has nonetheless spawned a billion-dollar industry. Coca-Cola started as a brand-new category of drink with dubious health benefits, spent much of the past century blanketing the world in nonsense advertising slogans such as “Open Happiness,” and is now available in almost every country on Earth. Red Bull threw vitamin B, an amino acid, and some caffeine into soda and told people it would give them energy. Vitaminwater has managed to make liquid sugar sound virtuous. Now Poppi and its ilk have capitalized on ambient concerns about gut health and sugar to sell a new kind of flavored fizzy water, one that signals something about the person drinking it. “It says you’re sophisticated,” Stephen Zagor, who teaches food entrepreneurship at Columbia University, told me: You’re not drinking the same soda as your parents. “It’s this sort of more informed consumer who can read a label,” Andrea Hernández, a trend forecaster who runs a Substack newsletter about packaged foods, told me: “Let’s replace all these things that we like and try to make sure that they’re not killing us.” But, Hernández said, none of this is a real challenge to traditional soda—it’s an endorsement of it: “If it wasn’t for the nostalgia of actual sodas, there would be no Olipop or Poppi.”\n\nUntil last week, I had never tried either—not because I’m ashamed to drink soda, but because I have been so devoted to Diet Coke for so long that anything else makes my tongue feel sweaty and disoriented. I bought a can of wild-berry Poppi at my local corner store for $2.99, which is significantly more than the $1.25 I spend on my usual tallboy of aspartame juice. It was cute and, sure, vaguely reminiscent of wild berries. I’m not sure what else to say: It tasted like soda.",

        "content": "Sign up for Derek’s newsletter here.\n\nIn September 1992, the band Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album. The record was mostly ignored until a music video for the song “No Rain,” featuring a girl in glasses dressed as a bumblebee, went berserk on MTV. The song rocketed up the Billboard Hot 100 charts. But that was the last time the band ever struck gold. Two decades later, Rolling Stone named “No Rain” one of the biggest one-hit wonders of all time.\n\nSoon after Blind Melon topped the charts, another artist had a breakout moment. Shania Twain released her second album, The Woman in Me, which included the No. 1 hit “Any Man of Mine.” Whatever the polar opposite of a one-hit wonder is, that’s what Shania Twain turned out to be. She became one of the most consistent hitmakers of her era, and the only female artist ever with three straight albums certified Diamond, meaning more than 10 million copies sold.\n\nFor decades, psychologists have puzzled over the ingredients of creative popularity by studying music, because the medium offers literally millions of data points. Is the thing that separates one-hit wonders from consistent hitmakers luck, or talent, or some complex combination of factors? I did my best to summarize their work in my book, Hit Makers. This month, the Stanford psychologist Justin Berg published a new paper on the topic and argued that the secret to creative success just happens to hinge on the difference between “No Rain” and Shania Twain.\n\nBerg compiled a data set of more than 3 million songs released from 1959 to 2010 and pulled out the biggest hits. He used an algorithm developed by the company EchoNest to measure the songs’ sonic features, including key, tempo, and danceability. This allowed him to quantify how similar a given hit is to the contemporary popular-music landscape (which he calls “novelty”), and the musical diversity of an artist’s body of work (“variety”).\n\n“Novelty is a double-edged sword,” Berg told me. “Being very different from the mainstream is really, really bad for your likelihood of initially making a hit when you’re not well known. But once you have a hit, novelty suddenly becomes a huge asset that is likely to sustain your success.” Mass audiences are drawn to what’s familiar, but they become loyal to what’s consistently distinct.\n\nBlind Melon’s “No Rain” rated extremely low on novelty in Berg’s research. Dreamy, guitar-driven soft rock wasn’t exactly innovative in 1992. According to Berg, this was the sort of song that was very likely to become a one-hit wonder: It rose to fame because of a quirky music video, not because the song itself stood out for its uniqueness. After that hit, the band struggled to distinguish their sound from everything else that was going on in music.\n\nBy contrast, Twain’s breakout hit rated high on novelty in Berg’s research. She was pioneering a new pop-country crossover genre that was bold for her time but would later inspire a generation of artists, like Taylor Swift. “Twain is a great fit for the model, because her blending of pop and country was so original before she had her breakout,” Berg told me. After her second album, he said, her novelty, which had previously been an artistic risk, helped her retain listeners. She could experiment within the kingdom of country-pop without much competition from other artists, and this allowed her to dominate the charts for the next decade.\n\nBerg’s research also found that musical variety (as opposed to novelty) was useful for artists before they broke out. But down the line, variety wasn’t very useful, possibly because audience expectations are set by initial hits. “After the first hit, the research showed that it was good for artists to focus on what I call relatedness, or similarity of music,” he said. Nobody wants Bruce Springsteen to make a rap album.\n\nThis second finding about the benefits of early variety is similar to a model of creativity known as explore-exploit. The Northwestern University economist Dashun Wang has found that artists and scientists tend to have “hot streaks,” or tight clusters of highly successful work. When he looked closer at what preceded these hot streaks, he found a similar pattern. First, artists and scientists would “explore,” or experiment with a bunch of different ideas, styles, jobs, or topics, before they really got in the zone. Then they would “exploit,” or productively focus on one particular area.\n\nBerg’s and Wang’s research suggests three rules of thumb that may come in handy for creative work.\n\nFirst, extremely new ideas are unlikely to initially find a large audience. But if they break through, artists and entrepreneurs may find that uniqueness is an asset, the same way that Twain’s country-pop hybrid style switched from a burden to a benefit after her first hit. Second, early-career exploration can pay dividends in the long run. This is as true of the broader labor force as it is in music. A 2014 study of young workers found that people who switch jobs more frequently early in their career tend to have higher incomes in their prime working years. Third, the difference between one-hit wonders and hitmakers isn’t just novelty; it’s also focus, or what Berg called “relatedness.” Hot streaks require creative people to mine deeply when they find something that works for them.",

        "content": "The now-famous white paper has proved to be a good road map for what the administration has done so far, and what may yet be on the way.\n\n“Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction,” Ronald Reagan said in 1967, in his inaugural address as governor of California. Kevin D. Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, approvingly quotes the speech in his foreword to Project 2025, the conservative think tank’s blueprint for the Trump administration. Roberts writes that the plan has four goals for protecting its vision of freedom: restoring the family “as the centerpiece of American life”; dismantling the federal bureaucracy; defending U.S. “sovereignty, borders, and bounty”; and securing “our God-given individual rights to live freely.”\n\nProject 2025 has proved to be a good road map for understanding the first months of Donald Trump’s second term, but most of the focus has been on efforts to dismantle the federal government as we know it. The effort to restore traditional families has been less prominent so far, but it could reshape the everyday lives of all Americans in fundamental ways. Its place atop the list of priorities is no accident—it reflects the most deeply held views of many of the contributors—though the destruction of the administrative state might end up imperiling the Trump team’s ability to actually carry out the changes the authors want.\n\nA focus on heterosexual, married, procreating couples is everywhere in Project 2025. “Families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-­ordered nation and healthy society,” writes Roger Severino, the author of a chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services and a former HHS and Justice Department staffer. (The document is structured as a series of chapters on specific departments or agencies, each written by one or a few authors.) He argues that the federal government should bolster organizations that “maintain a biblically based, social-­science-reinforced definition of marriage and family,” saying that other forms are less stable. The goal is not only moral; he and other authors see this as a path to financial stability and perhaps even greater prosperity for families.\n\nThis article has been adapted from David A. Graham’s new book, The Project.\n\nProject 2025’s authors identify a range of ways to achieve the goal across the executive branch. Changes to rules for 401(k)s and other savings programs would be more generous to married couples. HHS would enlist churches and other faith-­based organizations to “provide marriage and parenting guidance for low-­income fathers” that would “affirm and teach” based on “a biological and sociological understanding of what it means to be a father—­not a gender-neutral parent—­from social science, psychology, personal testimonies, etc.” Through educational programs, tax incentives, and other methods, the child-support system “should strengthen marriage as the norm, restore broken homes, and encourage unmarried couples to commit to marriage.” Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the lead federal welfare program, would track statistics about “marriage, healthy family formation, and delaying sex to prevent pregnancy.”\n\nJonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump\n\nIn this vision, men are breadwinners and women are mothers. “Without women, there are no children, and society cannot continue,” Max Primorac writes in his chapter on USAID, where he served in the first Trump administration. (Primorac calls for ridding the agency of “woke” politics and using it as an instrument of U.S. policy, but not the complete shutdown Trump has attempted.) Jonathan Berry writes that the Department of Labor, where he previously worked, would “commit to honest study of the challenges for women in the world of professional work” and seek to “understand the true causes of earnings gaps between men and women.” (This sounds a lot like research predetermined to reach an outcome backing the traditional family.) The Labor Department would produce monthly data on “the state of the American family and its economic welfare,” and the Education Department would provide student data sorted by family structure. Severino suggests that the government either pay parents (most likely mothers) to offset the cost of caring for children, or pay for in-­home care from family members; he opposes universal day care, which many on the right see as encouraging women to work rather than stay home with kids.\n\nAll of this fits a very conservative worldview, but in some places common ground emerges that might cut across typical partisan lines. For example, in a convergence of the crunchy left and natalist right, Severino wants doulas to be available to all expectant mothers. Contra Severino, Berry suggests that the Labor Department create incentives for on-site child care at work. He also wants Congress to require employers to let workers accumulate paid time off when working overtime, in place of time-and-­a-half pay, and to encourage rest time for workers by mandating time-and-a-half compensation on a Sabbath. (The suggested default would be Sunday, but the rule would allow for alternatives such as a Jewish Sabbath, running from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.)\n\nTurning these ideas into reality would require substantial engagement from the federal bureaucracy. Yet Trump and Elon Musk have spent the first months of the presidency haphazardly demolishing large swaths of the workforce at just the departments that would be necessary to make these things happen. Trump is attempting to dissolve the Education Department altogether; HHS has offered a buyout to every employee.\n\nThe parts of this family-oriented agenda that the Trump administration has already moved to enact are some of those that enforce a strictly binary concept of gender, aiming to drive trans and nonbinary people underground; open them up to discrimination at work, at school, and in the rest of their lives; and erase their very existence from the language of the federal government.\n\n“In the past, the word ‘gender’ was a polite alternative to the word ‘sex’ or term ‘biological sex,’” Primorac writes. “The Left has commandeered the term ‘gender,’ which used to mean either ‘male’ or ‘female,’ to include a spectrum of others who are seeking to alter biological and societal sexual norms.”\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that purports to define sex as binary. “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” the order states. “Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.” The order also dissolved the White House Gender Policy Council, created by former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports. The Defense Department says it will not accept transgender recruits for the armed forces, and will begin kicking out transgender service members currently in the military. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has moved to drop a discrimination case focused on gender identity, and the Education Department says it will enforce Title IX only to consider “biological sex.”\n\nPeter Wehner: Trump’s appetite for revenge is insatiable\n\nRight-wing leaders have made attacks on trans people and nontraditional expressions of gender a cornerstone of right-wing politics over the past few years. They have spread disinformation about trans people and panicked over the prospect of children adopting different gender identities or names at school. What is the reason for so much fear? Transgender people make up less than 2 percent of the population, and their presence in society doesn’t evidently harm other people. Project 2025’s pro-­family orientation helps explain why the right considers them such a threat. A worldview that sees gender roles as strictly delineated and immutable cannot acknowledge the existence of trans people or anything else that contemplates an alternative to a total separation between what it means to be male and what it means to be female.\n\nTrump has not yet made stricter abortion policies a focus in his new term. Though he has boasted about appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, he seems wary of pushing further, for fear of political backlash. Project 2025 has no such qualms. Severino recommends withdrawing FDA approval for abortion drugs, banning their prescription via telehealth, and using 1873’s Comstock Act to prohibit their mailing. He also recommends a strong federal surveillance program over abortion at the state level. Project 2025 also calls for the return of abstinence-only education and the criminalization of pornography.\n\nWith a little imagination, we can glimpse the America that Project 2025 proposes. It is an avowedly Christian nation, but following a very specific, narrow strain of Christianity. In many ways, it resembles the 1950s. While fathers work, mothers stay at home with larger families. At school, students learn old-­fashioned values and lessons. Abortion is illegal, vaccines are voluntary, and the state is minimally involved in health care. The government is slow to police racial discrimination in all but its most blatant expressions. Trans and LGBTQ people exist—­they always have—­but are encouraged to remain closeted. It is a vision that suggests Reagan was right: Freedom ­really is a fragile thing.\n\nThis article has been adapted from David A. Graham’s new book, The Project.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "On the first Sunday of spring, surrounded by row houses and magnolia trees, I came to a horrifying realization: My mom was right. I had been flipped off at least 17 times, called a “motherfucker” (in both English and Spanish), and a “fucking dork.” A woman in a blue sweater stared at me, sighed, and said, “You should be ashamed of yourself.” All of this because I was driving a Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nI had told my mom about my plan to rent this thing and drive it around Washington, D.C., for a day—a journalistic experiment to understand what it’s like behind the wheel of America’s most hated car. “Wow. Be careful,” she texted back right away. Both of us had read the stories of Cybertrucks possibly being set on fire, bombed with a Molotov cocktail, and vandalized in every way imaginable. People have targeted the car—and Tesla as a whole—to protest Elon Musk’s role in Donald Trump’s administration. But out of sheer masochism, or stupidity, I still went ahead and spent a day driving one. As I idled with the windows down on a street in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood, a woman glared at me from her front porch: “Fuck you, and this truck, and Elon,” she yelled. “You drive a Nazi truck.” She slammed her front door shut, and then opened it again. “I hope someone blows your shit up.”\n\nEarlier that day, my first stop was the heart of the resistance: the Dupont Circle farmers’ market. The people there wanted to see the organic asparagus and lion’s-mane mushrooms. What they did not want to see was a stainless-steel, supposedly bulletproof Cybertruck. Every red light created new moments for mockery. “You fucker!” yelled a bicyclist as he pedaled past me on P Street. The diners eating brunch on the sidewalk nearby laughed and cheered. Then came the next stoplight: A woman eating outside at Le Pain Quotidien gave me the middle finger for a solid 20 seconds, all without interrupting her conversation.\n\nKent Nishimura for The Atlantic\n\nThe anger is understandable. This is, after all, the radioactive center of DOGE’s blast radius. On the same block where I was yelled at in Mount Pleasant, I spotted a hand-drawn sign in one window: CFPB, it read, inside of a giant red heart; and at one point, I tailed behind a black Tesla Model Y with the bumper sticker Anti Elon Tesla Club. But the Cybertruck stands out on America’s roads about as much as LeBron James in a kindergarten classroom. No matter where you live, the car is a nearly 7,000-pound Rorschach test: It has become the defining symbol of the second Trump term. If you hate Trump and Musk, it is a giant MAGA hat, Pepe the Frog on wheels, or the “Swasticar.” If you love Trump and Musk, the Cybertruck is, well, a giant MAGA hat. On Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel called Tesla vandalism “domestic terrorism” as he announced a Tesla task force to investigate such acts. Alex Jones has trolled Tesla protesters from the back of his own Cybertruck, bullhorn in hand. Kid Rock has a Cybertruck with a custom Dukes of Hazzard paint job; the far-right podcaster Tim Pool owns one and says he’ll buy another “because it will own the libs”; and Kanye West has three. Trump’s 17-year-old granddaughter was gifted one by the president, and another by Musk.\n\nKent Nishimura for The Atlantic\n\nWhen I parked the car for lunch in Takoma Park, where I support federal workers signs were staked into the grass, I heard two women whispering at a nearby table: “Should we egg it?” (In this economy?) Over and over again, as pedestrians and drivers alike glared at me, I had to remind myself: It’s just a car. And it’s kind of a cool one, too. It can apparently outrace a Porsche 911, while simultaneously towing a Porsche 911. Or it can power a house for up to three days. My day in the Cybertruck wasn’t extremely hard-core, but the eight onboard cameras made city driving more bearable than I was expecting. Regardless of what you do with it, the car is emissions-free. “The underlying technology of the Cybertruck is amazing,” Loren McDonald, an EV analyst at the firm Paren, told me. And the exterior undersells just how ridiculous it is. Just before I returned the car on Monday morning, I took an impromptu Zoom meeting from the giant in-car touchscreen. It has a single windshield wiper that is so long—more than five feet—that Musk has compared it to a “katana.”\n\nKent Nishimura for The Atlantic\n\nAfter 10 hours of near-constant hazing, I navigated to an underground parking lot to recharge the truck (and my battered self-image). Someone had placed a sticker just beneath the Tesla logo: Elon Musk is a parasite, it read. Still, even in D.C., I got a fair number of thumbs-ups as my Cybertruck zoomed by the areas most frequented by tourists. Near the National Mall, a man in a red bandanna and shorts yelled, “That’s awesome!” and cheered. Perhaps it was an attempt at MAGA solidarity, or maybe not. Lots of people just seemed to think it looked cool. One guy in his 20s, wearing a make money, not friends hoodie, frantically took out his phone to film me making a left turn. Even in the bluest neighborhoods of D.C.—near a restaurant named Marx Cafe and a Ruth Bader Ginsburg mural—kids could not get enough of the Cybertruck. One girl in Takoma Park saw me and started screaming, “Cybertruck! Cybertruck!” Later, a boy spotted the car and frantically rode his scooter to try to get a better look. Just before sunset, I was struggling to change lanes near George Washington University when two teens stopped to stare at me from the sidewalk. I was anxiously checking directions on my phone and clearly had no idea where to go. “Must be an Uber,” one said to the other.\n\nRead: Admit it, the Cybertruck is awesome\n\nBy 9 p.m., I’d had enough. I valeted at my hotel, with its “Tibetan Bowl Sound Healing” classes, and got a nervous look from the attendant. I can’t blame anyone who sees the car as the stainless-steel embodiment of the modern right. This week, a county sheriff in Ohio stood in front of a green Cybertruck and derided Tesla vandals as “little fat people that live in their mom’s basement and wear their mom’s pajamas.” But it is also a tragedy that the Cybertruck has become the most partisan car in existence—more so than the Prius, or the Hummer, or any kind of Subaru. The Cybertruck, an instantly meme-able and very weird car, could have helped America fall in love with EVs. Instead, it is doing the opposite. The revolt against Tesla is not slowing down, and in some cases people are outright getting rid of their cars. Is it really a win that Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona exchanged his all-electric Tesla sedan for a gas-guzzling SUV?\n\nThen again, Republicans aren’t buying the Cybertruck en masse. It is too expensive and too weird. Buying any Tesla might be a way to own the libs, but the right has proved maddeningly resistant to going electric. “Your average MAGA Trump supporter isn’t going to go buy a Tesla,” McDonald, the EV analyst, said. Before the car shipped in November 2023, Musk predicted that Tesla would sell 250,000 a year. He hasn’t even sold one-fifth of that in total—and sales are falling. (Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to a request for comment.)\n\nKent Nishimura for The Atlantic\n\nMusk made a lot of other promises that haven’t really panned out: The Cybertruck was supposed to debut at less than $40,000. The cheapest model currently available is double that. The vehicle, Musk said, would be “really tough, not fake tough.” Instead, its stainless-steel side panels have fallen off because Tesla used the wrong glue—and that was just the most recent of the car’s eight recalls. The Cybertruck was supposed to be able to haul “near infinite mass” and “serve briefly as a boat.” Just this month alone, one Cybertruck’s rear end snapped off in a test of its towing power, and another sank off the coast of Los Angeles while trying to offload a Jet Ski from the bed.\n\nThe Cybertruck, in that sense, is a perfect metaphor for Musk himself. The world’s richest man has a bad habit of promising one thing and delivering another. X was supposed to be the “everything app”; now it is a cesspool of white supremacy. DOGE was billed as an attempt to make the government more nimble and tech-savvy. Instead, the cuts have resulted in seniors struggling to get their Social Security checks. So far, Musk has only continued to get richer and more powerful while the rest of us have had to deal with the wreckage. Let that sink in, as he likes to say. The disaster of the Cybertruck is not that it’s ugly, or unconventional, or absurdly pointy. It’s that, for most people, the car just isn’t worth driving.",

        "title": "An ‘Impossible’ Disease Outbreak in the Alps",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In March 2009, after a long night on duty at the hospital, Emmeline Lagrange took a deep breath and prepared to place a devastating phone call. Lagrange, a neurologist, had diagnosed a 42-year-old woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The woman lived in a small village in the French Alps, an hour and a half drive away from Lagrange’s office in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital. Because ALS is rare, Lagrange expected that the patient’s general practitioner, Valerie Foucault, had never seen a case before.\n\nSnow fell outside Lagrange’s window as she got ready to describe how ALS inevitably paralyzes and kills its victims. But to her surprise, as soon as she shared the diagnosis, Foucault responded, “I know this disease very well, because she is the fourth in my village.”\n\nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, occurs in roughly two to three people out of every 100,000 in Europe. (The rate is slightly higher in the United States.) But every so often, hot spots emerge. Elevated ALS rates have been observed around a lagoon in France, surrounding a lake in New Hampshire, within a single apartment building in Montreal, and on the eastern—but not western—flank of Italy’s Mount Etna. Such patterns have confounded scientists, who have spent 150 years searching for what causes the disease. Much of the recent research has focused on the genetics of ALS, but clusters provocatively suggest that environmental factors have a leading role. And each new cluster offers scientists a rare chance to clarify what those environmental influences may be—if they can study it fast enough. Many clusters fade away as mysteriously as they once appeared.\n\nAfter the call, Lagrange was uneasy; she had a hunch about how much work lay ahead of her. For the next decade, she and a team of scientists investigated the cluster in the Alps, which eventually grew to include 16 people—a total 10 times higher than the area’s small population should have produced. Even during that first call, when Lagrange knew about only four cases of ALS, she felt dazed by the implications, and by Foucault’s desperate plea for help. If something in the village was behind the disturbing numbers, Foucault had no idea what it was. “She was really upset,” Lagrange remembers. “She said to me, ‘This is impossible; you must stop this.’”\n\nFor some people, the trouble begins in the throat. As their muscles waste, swallowing liquids becomes a strenuous activity. Others may first notice difficulty moving an arm or a leg. “Every day, we see that they lose something,” Foucault said of her patients. “You lose a finger, or you lose your laugh.” Eventually, enough motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord die that people simply cannot breathe. Lou Gehrig died two years after his diagnosis, when he was just 37. Stephen Hawking, an anomaly, lived with ALS until he was 76.\n\nFive to 10 percent of people with ALS have a family member with the disease. In the 2000s, advancements in DNA sequencing led to a swell of genetic research that found that about two-thirds of those familial cases are connected to a handful of genetic mutations. But only one in 10 cases of ALS in which patients have no family history of the disease can be connected to genetic abnormalities. “What we have to then explain is how, in the absence of genetic mutation, you get to the same destination,” Neil Shneider, the director of Columbia’s Eleanor and Lou Gehrig ALS Center, told me.\n\nScientists have come up with several hypotheses for how ALS develops, each more complicated and harder to study than genetics alone. One suggests that ALS is caused by a combination of genetic disposition and environmental exposures throughout a lifetime. Another suggests that the disease develops after one person receives six cumulative “hits,” which can be genetic mutations, exposures to toxins, and perhaps even lifestyle factors such as smoking.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nEmmeline Lagrange stands in her office at Grenoble University Hospital.\n\nEach time a cluster appears, researchers have tried to pin down the exact environmental hazards, professions, and activities that might be linked to it. After World War II, a neurodegenerative disease that looked just like ALS—though some patients also showed features of Parkinson’s and dementia—surged in Guam, predominantly among the native Chamorro people. “Imagine walking into a village where 25 percent of the people are dying from ALS,” says Paul Alan Cox, an ethnobotanist who studied the outbreak. “It was like an Agatha Christie novel: Who’s the murderer?”\n\nEarly research tried to pin the deaths on an unlikely culprit: the highly toxic cycad plant and its seeds, which locals ground into flour to make tortillas. Cox and his colleagues hypothesize that human cells mistake a compound called BMAA found in the plant for another amino acid, leading to misfolded proteins in the brain. Peter Spencer, an environmental neuroscientist at Oregon Health & Science University, has argued for a different explanation: The body converts cycasin, a compound also found in the plant’s seeds, into a toxic chemical that can cause DNA damage and, eventually, neurodegeneration. Each theory faced its own criticism, and a consensus was never reached—except for perhaps an overarching tacit agreement that the environment was somehow integral to the story. By the end of the 20th century, the Guam cluster had all but vanished.\n\nGenetic mutations are precise; the world is messy. This is partly why ALS research still focuses on genes, Evelyn Talbott, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told me. It’s also why clusters, muddled as they might be, are so valuable: They give scientists the chance to find what’s lurking in the mess.\n\nMontchavin was a mining town until 1886, when the mine closed, leaving the village largely deserted. In 1973, it was connected to a larger network of winter-tourism destinations in the Alps. On a sunny December afternoon, the week before ski season officially began, I met Foucault outside of the church in the center of Bellentre, a town of 900 whose borders include Montchavin and neighboring villages. The mountains loomed over us, not yet capped with much snow, as she greeted me in a puffer coat. She led me briskly up a steep hill, chatting in a mix of French and English, until we arrived at her home, which she occasionally uses as an office to see patients.\n\nFoucault made us a pot of black tea, then set down a notepad of scrawled diagnoses and death dates on the table beside her. The first person Foucault knew with ALS lived a stone’s throw from where we were sitting, in a house down the hill; he had been diagnosed in 1991. The second case was a ski instructor, Daniel, who lived in Montchavin and had a chalet near Les Coches, a ski village five minutes up a switchback road by car. Daniel, whose family requested that I use only his first name for medical privacy, had told Foucault in 2000 that he was having trouble speaking, so she’d sent him to a larynx specialist. When the specialist found nothing wrong with his throat, Daniel was referred to a neurologist in Grenoble, who diagnosed him with ALS.\n\nIn 2005, after Foucault heard that the husband of one of her general-medicine patients had been diagnosed with ALS, she called her father, a heart doctor in Normandy. “It’s not normal,” he told her. A few years later, she saw one of her patients, the 42-year-old woman, in the village center with her arm hanging limp from her body. Even before the woman received her ALS diagnosis from Lagrange, Foucault suspected the worst.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nValerie Foucault stands in her backyard in Bellentre.\n\nAfter her call with Foucault, Lagrange assembled a team of neurologists and collaborators from the French government to search for an environmental spark that might have set off the cluster in Montchavin. They tested for heavy metals in the drinking water, toxins in the soil, and pollutants in the air. When the village was turned into a ski destination in the 1970s, builders had repurposed wood from old train cars to build garden beds—so the team checked the environment for creosote, a chemical used in the manufacture of those train cars. They screened for compounds from an artificial snow used in the ’80s. They checked gardens, wells, and even the brain of one deceased ALS patient. Years passed, and nothing significant was found.\n\nThe day after I had tea with Foucault, I visited Lagrange at the hospital. Her voice faltered as she ruffled through the piles of papers from their investigation on her desk. She’d cared for most of Montchavin’s ALS patients from their diagnosis to death. She worked in Montchavin on the weekends and took her family vacations there. “I felt responsible for them,” she said. “People were telling me, This is genetic. They all live together; they must be cousins. I knew it was not so.” Lagrange’s team had tested the genomes of 12 people in the Montchavin cluster, and none had mutations that were associated with ALS. Nor did any of the patients have parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents with ALS.\n\nBut their lives did overlap in other meaningful ways. The first Montchavin cases worked together as ski instructors and had chalets in a wooded patch of land called L’Orgère, up the mountain. Many of them hiked together; others simply enjoyed spending time in nature. “We thought they must have something in common, something that they would eat or drink,” Lagrange told me, sitting in her desk chair in a white lab coat and thick brown-framed glasses. She handed me a daunting packet: a questionnaire she’d developed for the ALS patients, their families, and hundreds of people without the disease who lived in the area. The survey, which took about three hours to complete, asked about lifestyle, eating habits, hobbies, jobs, everywhere they had lived, and more. It revealed that the ALS patients consistently ate three foods that the controls didn’t: game, dandelion greens, and wild mushrooms.\n\nLagrange’s team didn’t immediately suspect the mushrooms. But Spencer, the environmental neuroscientist in Oregon, did after he saw one of Lagrange’s colleagues present on the Montchavin cluster at a 2017 conference. Having researched the role of the cycad seed in the Guam cluster, Spencer knew that some mushrooms contain toxins that can powerfully affect the nervous system.\n\nSpencer joined the research group, and in 2018, he accompanied Lagrange to Montchavin to distribute more surveys and conduct in-person interviews about the victims’ and other locals’ diets— the pair had particular interest in people’s mushroom consumption. From the responses, the team learned that the ALS patients were not the only mushroom foragers in town, but they shared an affinity for a particular species that local interviewees without ALS said they never touched: the false morel.\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nThe streets of Montchavin are quiet before ski season begins.\n\nA false morel looks like a brain that has been left out in the sun. Its cap is a shriveled mass of brown folds, darker than the caramel hue of the true morel. One species, Gyromitra esculenta, grew around Montchavin and was especially abundant near the ski chalets in spring if enough snow had fallen the preceding winter. France has a rich foraging culture, and the false morel was just one of many species mushroom enthusiasts in Montchavin might pick up to sauté with butter and herbs. The false morel contains gyromitrin, a toxin that sickens some number of foragers around the world every year; half of the ALS victims in Montchavin reported a time when they had acute mushroom poisoning. And according to Spencer, the human body may also metabolize gyromitrin into a compound that, over time, might lead to similar DNA damage as cycad seeds.\n\nNo one can yet say that the false morel caused ALS in Montchavin; Lagrange plans to test the mushroom or its toxin in animal models to help establish whether it leads to neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, Spencer feels that the connection between Montchavin and Guam is profound—that the cluster in the Alps is another indication that environmental triggers can be strongly associated with neurodegenerative disease.\n\nOnce you start looking, the sheer variety of potential environmental catalysts for ALS becomes overwhelming: pesticides, heavy metals, air pollution, bodies of water with cyanobacteria blooms. Military service is associated with higher ALS risk, as is being a professional football player, a painter, a farmer, or a mechanic. Because of how wide-ranging these findings are, some researchers doubt the utility of environmental research for people with ALS. Maybe the causes are too varied to add up to a meaningful story about ALS, and each leads to clusters in a different way. Or perhaps, Jeffrey Rothstein, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine neurologist, told me, a cluster means nothing; it’s simply a rare statistical aberration. “Patients are always looking for some reason why they have such a terrible disease,” he said. “There’s been plenty of blips like this over time in ALS, and each one has its own little thought of what’s causing it, and they’ve all gone nowhere.”\n\n“A lot of people look askew to the idea that there are clusters,” Eva Feldman, a neurologist at the University of Michigan, told me. But she sees evidence of clusters all the time in her practice. Once, she saw three women with ALS who’d grown up within blocks of one another in the Grand Rapids area. Her research has shown an association between ALS and organic pollutants, particularly pesticides. Feldman thinks that the importance and scope of environmental triggers for ALS can be pinpointed only by investigating clusters more thoroughly. To start, she told me, doctors should be required to disclose every case of ALS to state officials. Feldman is also planning what she says is the first-ever prospective study on ALS in the U.S., following 4,000 healthy production workers in Michigan. She believes that clusters have significance and that because doctors can’t do much to stop ALS once it starts, “we would be naive to throw out any new ideas” about how to prevent it from occurring in the first place.\n\nEven for the people whose lives were upended by the Montchavin cluster, the idea that mushrooms could be linked to such suffering can be difficult to accept. Those who ate them knew the mushrooms could cause unpleasant side effects, but they believed that cooking them removed most of the danger. When I asked Claude Houbart, whose father, Gilles, died in 2019, about his mushroom habits, she called her mother and put her on speakerphone. Claude’s mother said she knew Gilles ate false morels, but she never cooked them for herself or the family—simply because she didn’t want to risk upset stomachs.\n\nDaniel, Foucault’s second ALS patient, also kept his foraging hobby out of the home. He never ate false morels in front of his wife, Brigitte, though she knew he picked wild mushrooms with friends. “I am a bit reluctant when it comes to mushrooms; I would have never cooked them,” Brigitte told me, sitting at her kitchen table in Montchavin, surrounded by photos of Daniel and their now-adult children. After Daniel died in 2008, Brigitte and her family spread his ashes in the woods where he’d spent so much of his time. “He didn’t want a tomb like everyone else,” she said. “When we walk in the forest, we think about him.”\n\nElliott Verdier for The Atlantic\n\nBrigitte sits in her home in Montchavin.\n\nHervé Fino, a retired vacation-company manager who has lived in the Alps for 41 years, learned to forage in Montchavin. Bundled in a plaid overcoat inside a wood-paneled rental chalet, Fino recalled local foragers telling him that false morels were edible as long as they were well cooked, but he never ate the mushrooms himself, fearing their digestive effects. Fino told me about one of his friends who regularly gathered false morels, and once made himself a false-morel omelet when his wife was out of town. “He was sick for two days, very ill,” Fino said. Later, that same friend was diagnosed with ALS. He died by suicide.\n\nIn a gruff voice, Fino speculated about what besides the mushroom might have caused the disease. His friend fell into an icy-cold brook two days before he was diagnosed—“Perhaps the shock triggered the disease?” Another woman owned a failing restaurant next to the cable car—maybe the stress had something to do with it. He shrugged his shoulders. Those events didn’t seem right either, not momentous enough to so dramatically alter someone’s fate. Maybe no single explanation ever will. Claude told me she understands why people are skeptical. “Eating a mushroom and then dying in that way?” she said. “Come on.”\n\nBefore leaving Montchavin, I walked through L’Orgère, the area where the first ALS patients had their ski cabins. The windows were dark, and below, the village of Montchavin was mostly empty before the tourist season began. Clumps of snow started to fall, hopefully enough to satisfy the skiers. Recent winters in the French Alps have been warm and dry—not the right conditions for false morels. “There are no more Gyromitra in Montchavin,” Lagrange said. In her view, Montchavin has joined the ranks of ALS clusters come and gone; no one has been diagnosed there since 2019, and it’s been longer since Lagrange’s team has turned up a fresh false-morel specimen.\n\nEven so, on my walk, I couldn’t help but scan for mushrooms, nor could I shake the feeling that my surroundings were not as benign as I’d once believed. Fino said he still keeps an eye out for false morels too. He would never pluck them from the ground to bring home, and yet, he hasn’t stopped looking. One day in 2023, after he parked his car near a ski lift, his gaze caught on a lumpy spot near his feet. Two dark-brown mushrooms stuck out of the damp soil.",

        "content": "This article is the first in a series about the Trump administration's use of Signal group chatting. Read the next story in the series here\n\nU.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.\n\nI, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nRead: Here are the attack plans that Trump’s advisers shared on Signal\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows debate over the president’s views ahead of the attack.\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows reactions to the strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nRead: A conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg about his extraordinary scoop\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Across the press-briefing room in the West Wing, past the lectern where the beaming blond press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, admonishes members of the meddlesome press, behind a blue sliding door, past a bored-looking security guard, and inside a small, cluttered office, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung is on X, trolling his boss’s enemies.\n\n“The camera can’t stabilize because the watermelon head is wobbling precariously on a pencil neck,” he wrote on March 13, above a video of Representative Adam Schiff of California. Watching CNN’s Erin Burnett talk about economics, he posted on March 10, “is like watching a donkey try to solve a Rubix [sic] Cube.”\n\nThis is standard internet talk for Cheung, who, during the 2024 presidential primary, publicly referred to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as a “desperate eunuch” and asked why he would “cuck himself” before the country. But it’s a new tone for a White House communications director.\n\nAlthough Cheung is more of a back-office guy, you may have caught glimpses of him last spring, escorting the would-be president in and out of Alvin Bragg’s downtown-Manhattan courtroom. Not particularly tall, he is rotund, with a shiny, egg-shaped head and a deep wrinkle etched above his brow. Observers have noted that, standing next to Donald Trump, Cheung (who is ethnically Chinese) looks a bit like Oddjob, the archvillain’s silent but menacing sidekick in the 1964 James Bond film, Goldfinger. Cheung happily made the comparison himself last week, when he reposted a photo of himself wearing a black bowler hat—Oddjob’s signature concealed weapon.\n\nCheung worked in communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship before joining the 2016 Trump campaign—and he brought along an apparently boundless appetite for combat. Now 42, he has stuck with the president for close to a decade in a variety of roles that have spanned the turbulence of the Access Hollywood tape, the backbiting of the first administration, and the wilderness period that followed Trump’s 2020 election loss. For much of that time, Cheung kept a low profile. That has changed. And by all accounts, Trump loves him. The president has referred to Cheung as his “sumo wrestler,” and commented proudly on the size of Cheung’s hands. (“Look at those hands. You’re in good shape if he’s with you,” he once reportedly said.)\n\nThe paradox of Cheung is that, behind the scenes, the president’s attack dog is friendly, and peppers his conversations with generous belly laughs and the occasional “hoo boy.” In interviews, nearly a dozen reporters from outlets across the ideological spectrum described him to me as a uniquely pleasant and straightforward aide in Trump's mostly toxic orbit. The Cheungian approach to communications leans deep into this paradox. He will engage journalists in pleasant chitchat, argue good-naturedly about the finer points of a story, and then fire off a public insult. “These sources are full of shit and have no idea what they are talking about,” Cheung said in a story by the journalist Tara Palmeri, who writes the Red Letter Substack. But Palmeri described Cheung to me as generally calm and reasonable.\n\nIn Trump’s first administration, constant warring among aides resulted in sloppy, inconsistent messaging and a steady flow of leaks. But the staffers in Trump 2.0 appear, at least for now, to be more united—in ideology as well as attitude. They have no use for norms and politesse. American political language, Cheung told me in an interview earlier this month, “was due for a supercharge.” And under his leadership, the comms team is engaged in a campaign of relentless—often performative—hostility. “He has a skill that I don’t, which is to come up with the funniest, most aggressive one-liners you’ve ever heard, in seconds,” Leavitt told me.\n\nTrump’s incursion against American institutions is now benefiting from a communications operation that is more effective—and far more withering. Cheung has been the architect of this new messaging era, bringing all that is authentically vulgar, unflinching, and cruel about his boss to official White House statements. “In the first Trump term, Cheung was not a big player at all,” Palmeri told me. “Now he’s the voice of Trump.”\n\nTom Nichols: Trump’s titushky\n\nWhen I met Cheung recently, I found him standing outside his office, chatting happily with a pair of reporters. That afternoon, Elon Musk would join the president as he shopped for a brand-new Tesla from a selection of vehicles arranged around the White House’s South Portico like gifts in an episode of My Super Sweet 16. One of the reporters was wondering, as reporters tend to do, about the ethics of it all. But Cheung’s excitement would not be dimmed. “You guys are in for a surprise,” he told them. “Did the White House counsel approve staff participation in the endorsement of a private product?” the reporter asked. Cheung rolled his eyes but seemed to be enjoying himself as the two went back and forth. Eventually, the reporters shuffled away with a statement from Cheung that skirted the ethical issue. Smiling, Cheung ushered me into his office.\n\nDonald Trump and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung on board Air Force One.

Even so, I was surprised by Cheung’s soft-spokenness and plastic-rimmed Tina Fey glasses—a very thoughtful look for a henchman. In one corner of his office, a flatscreen TV played four news channels at once (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, and Newsmax); in another corner sat a red cap embroidered with the words TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING. On the walls, a few gold frames hung empty, because Cheung has yet to receive the enlargements of his favorite campaign-trail photos. There are no personal pictures in sight, because he has no personal life. Cheung told me he has no time for that.\n\nCheung grew up in Sacramento, California, where his parents settled after they emigrated from Japan and Hong Kong in the 1960s. They’re all still close, Cheung says, but his family never actually cared much about politics, conservative or liberal, until he started working for Trump. Growing up, Cheung’s older brother, Stanley, was always the gifted one. He now works as an electrical engineer. Steven spent three years at California State University at Sacramento, but did not graduate. Now he has a job in the West Wing, and a plaque signed by Trump hangs in his parents’ home. “I had no idea,” he told me, gesturing around his office, “this is where life would take me.”\n\nDuring college, Cheung interned in then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s speechwriting office; after dropping out of school, he worked on a string of political campaigns, including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. In 2009, Cheung wanted a job on the Republican underdog Steve Poizner’s campaign for California governor so much that he volunteered for two weeks before being hired as director of online messaging. “He’s an animal when it comes to hard work,” Jim Bognet, Poizner’s former campaign manager, told me. Cheung launched his own political-consulting company, Solgence, and worked on rapid response for Republican Senate candidates in Nevada and Texas.\n\nThen, in 2013, Cheung got the job that would become Trumpworld lore. The Ultimate Fighting Championship hired Cheung as its director of communications and public affairs—bringing him on, in part, to lobby for the legalization of mixed-martial-arts fighting in New York. The UFC had recently evolved from a niche pay-per-view service into a recognized sport with mass-market appeal. This was the era of Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey, and the franchise’s brand was all about vulgarity and social taboo. Nobody did more for the sport than CEO Dana White, whose cultivated machismo and plainspokenness had engendered trust among viewers.\n\nCheung left the UFC after three years, when the company was sold. He climbed aboard Trump’s chaotic train in 2016, as manager of rapid response, and continued to abide by White’s governing philosophy: “Be aggressive all the time—you can’t relent,” Cheung told me. “Bringing that mindset into politics,” he added, “I don’t think anyone’s really done that before.”\n\nTrump still makes occasional appearances at UFC fights, and Cheung delights in showing him off. “When he walks in back of Trump in his posse,” the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told me, “he always gets that little smile.” On St. Patrick’s Day this year, when McGregor visited the Oval Office, Cheung posted a photo of their meeting commemorating the collision of his two worlds. The caption: “Past life 🤝 Current life.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2022 issue: American Rasputin\n\nGiven that Cheung was one of the few Trump staffers with experience on a presidential campaign, he became a kind of political sage on the 14th floor of Trump Tower. Other aides often sought advice from Cheung, who had demonstrated a preternatural ability to remain calm throughout a campaign defined, in large part, by scandal. “You’re hired to do a job,” he told me, by way of explanation. “And you need to execute.”\n\nAfter Trump’s surprise win in November 2016, Cheung joined the White House team as a special assistant to the president and as the assistant communications director. Two factions soon formed in the West Wing: the first, a renegade MAGA coalition mostly aligned with Bannon; the second, a group of establishment GOP holdovers allied with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. The infighting was constant and vicious, with each group trying to shiv the other in the press. The leaky mess was a reporter’s dream.\n\nBecause he’d come from the campaign, Cheung was definitely more of a Bannon guy, people told me. But the internal sniping left him largely unscathed. “He has among the broadest ranges of relationships across Trump’s orbit,” one White House reporter, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about his working relationship with Cheung, told me. “He’s the demilitarized zone of the private Trump world, which might surprise people, given his public persona.”\n\nEarly on, Bannon referred to Cheung and a few of the other younger men in the White House as his “killers” and instructed them to create a plan to “weaponize comms,” one friend of Cheung’s, who worked in the first Trump administration and requested anonymity in order to speak frankly, told me, by bringing a more aggressive posture toward critical coverage. But by early summer 2018, Chief of Staff John Kelly was cleaning house—and Cheung, whom Kelly distrusted, was swept out. But Cheung was happy to land back on the campaign side, where the action was, consulting for Trump.\n\nCheung helped with Trump’s debate preparation in 2020, and the Republican National Convention. But Cheung’s contract was up on the day after Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November. So he was not involved in the “Stop the Steal” madness that followed, and he was not in the White House on January 6, 2021, when rioters broke into the U.S. Capitol. Publicly, Cheung has said that people know “who really won the election” in 2020, and he has defended Trump’s assertion that January 6 was “a day of love.” But he declined to comment about either in our interview.\n\nDuring the Biden presidency, Cheung spent most of his time working on crisis communications for corporate clients, and consulting on two strikingly different political bids: Caitlyn Jenner’s campaign for California governor, and the Senate run of disgraced Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who’d resigned from office after being accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nSoon enough, Cheung found his way back to Trump. Just ahead of the midterms, Susie Wiles, Trump’s campaign manager, hired Cheung to work for MAGA Inc., a new political-action committee that would become the staff feeder for Trump’s third presidential campaign. This was a dark period for Trump, who had left office in disgrace and was now embroiled in several high-profile court cases. It was not exactly an ideal time to attach one’s political career to the Trump name. But Cheung joined the campaign anyway.\n\n“You gotta finish the story,” Cheung told me when I asked what made him do it. “You ride it ’til the wheels fall off.” Wiles corporatized the campaign team, adding the structure it had previously lacked. Then she unleashed Cheung on the primary contest.\n\nStarting in late summer 2023, Cheung sent out a series of ruthless campaign statements he called the “Kiss of Death” countdown, after a Republican consultant said that Trump’s principal rival for the GOP nomination, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, had “60 days to beat Trump.” The emails often implied that DeSantis, who sometimes appeared to be wearing lifts, enjoyed dressing like a woman. “Ron shuffled his feet and gingerly walked across the debate set like a 10 year old girl who had just raided her mom’s closet and discovered heels for the first time,” Cheung wrote after the October debate.\n\nMost reporters who cover Trump are familiar with the publicly rude, privately nice dynamic that many MAGA operatives employ. But the obnoxious emails were especially jarring coming from Cheung. “He’s like a giant teddy bear,” one former White House correspondent, who requested anonymity because she feared online attacks from Cheung, told me.\n\nIt was Trump’s idea, Cheung told me, to fly the Trump-campaign jet low over the fairgrounds before his arrival in Des Moines, Iowa. Giddy, Cheung gave the reporters covering DeSantis on the ground a five-minute warning. And just as DeSantis took his turn in the spotlight, flipping pork burgers in front of a crowd, Trump’s plane flew overhead and stole the moment.\n\nBy early 2024, DeSantis was out of the race, and the action had shifted to a Lower Manhattan court, where Trump was on trial for paying hush money to a porn star, and where Cheung could be found loitering on the sidelines, like some kind of bouncer-lawyer hybrid. “Make no mistake, this is election interference of the highest order,” he barked in a rare on-camera appearance. “Crooked Joe Biden and his campaign are in complete freak-out mode.”\n\nAdam Serwer: The cruelty is the point\n\nThe White House communications team has adopted the campaign’s “battle rhythm,” said Leavitt, who is close to Cheung, figuratively, but also literally, as his office neighbor in the West Wing. And this unified team is now waging war on the press.\n\nThe administration has banned the Associated Press from covering events in the Oval Office, because of the wire service’s refusal to use the administration’s preferred term “Gulf of America,” and it has wrested control of the White House press pool from the independent White House Correspondents’ Association. It has also granted White House access to many deferential outlets, including Bannon’s podcast and the sycophantic Real America’s Voice network. But Cheung prickled when I questioned whether the team’s ultimate objective is to curtail critical press coverage. “Ask any reporter who’s covered the campaign how much access we’ve given to them,” he said. “We’ve gone out of our way to expand access.” (True, Trump himself takes questions all the time, but the White House has also attacked and punished outlets for coverage it doesn’t like.)\n\nDespite that insistence, Cheung has now realized Bannon’s dream of weaponized comms, ushering in a new era of political messaging in Washington. Gone are the mild stumbles of “covfefe” and the meme-ry of Sean Spicer retreating into the White House shrubbery. Trump has reverted to his own killer instincts, assailing his enemies with all-caps Truth Social rants. Don’t expect anyone to rein him in. “When times get tough, you don’t take a step back; you double down,” Cheung said, when I asked whether Trump ever goes too far. “And if that doesn’t work, you triple down.”\n\nThe Cheungian tactic of instant escalation is, for him and his allies, a win-win strategy: It helps quench the base’s thirst for lib-owning—and gets a ton of eyeballs. “If Cheung calls Tim Walz a cuck versus if he says, ‘Walz is incorrect because of X, Y, and Z,’ which one is going to get more attention?” a senior White House official, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly, told me. The method is brutal but, Cheung and his allies believe, effective.\n\nThe logical end point of this mindset is the dehumanization of not only one’s opponents, but anyone who isn’t a loud loyalist. “From a broader, 35,000-foot view, is this healthy?” another friend of Cheung’s from the first Trump White House, who similarly requested anonymity, told me. “I don’t know. I don’t think it’s great.”\n\nThis shock-and-awe style that has come to define communication in the second Trump era seems to draw no distinction between aggressive trolling of political opponents and outright cruelty to other human beings. In a video shared by the White House last month, immigration agents put men in shackles, and marched them up a gangway onto a waiting plane. The video, which was made by the White House’s digital team and approved by Cheung, is captioned “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,” implying that the sight and sound of people being deported is pleasing.\n\nThe post received 200 million views and 886,000 engagements across X and Instagram, Cheung told me. He sounded proud.",

The group chat, created by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, included several high-level administration members, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and an account called “TG,” the initials of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. In screenshots published by The Atlantic, the defense secretary messaged information about strike targets and times of attack. Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nThe report of the security breakdown launched hundreds of memes, and group chats across the country were jokingly renamed “Houthi PC Small Group.” Amid the snickering in Washington, D.C., were also denials—from Gabbard, Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and President Trump—both to reporters and in congressional hearings, that the information in the chat was classified.\n\nWe talk with Shane Harris, a national-security reporter for The Atlantic, about how he would characterize the messages and what kind of reverberations to expect from this breach.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nClaudine Ebeid: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Claudine Ebeid, in for Hanna Rosin. On Monday, The Atlantic reported that our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to a Signal group chat. It was a thread with senior Trump administration officials that included sensitive military information about an attack on Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nOn the day of the attack, March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared operational details two hours before the strikes. And Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nEarlier this week, Jeff and Atlantic staff writer Shane Harris were on the show. Since then, administration officials have roundly denied there was any classified information in the thread, including in testimony before Congress.\n\nMark Warner: Director Gabbard, you are the security executive and set access guidelines for classified information. Did you contact the defense secretary or others after this specific military planning was put out and say: Hey—we should be doing this in a SCIF? Tulsi Gabbard: There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat. Warner: So then if there [is] no classified material, share it with the committee.\n\nEbeid: With me now is Shane Harris, who covers national security. Hi, Shane.\n\nShane Harris: Hi.\n\nEbeid: So Shane, we just heard Democratic Senator Mark Warner questioning Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. She and other administration officials have reiterated that there was no classified information in the Signal chat.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the administration’s response after the original story was published?\n\nHarris: My reaction was Well, if what we’re looking at in these texts isn’t classified information, then maybe I don’t know what classified information is. (Laughs.) I’ve been doing this a while, and look—I mean, I don’t understand their argument here.\n\nThis information is presumptively classified, and I don’t think you have to take my word for it. You can actually go look at DOD regulations and intelligence regulations that are available online, and there are helpful tables where in one column it will, you know, list the descriptions of kinds of information and then tell you their relevant classification status, where they should be set.\n\nAnd there are all kinds of different categories that are implicated in this text chain—in particular, when we’re talking about things like these strike plans that you just heard Senator Warner ask Director Gabbard about that Secretary Hegseth had shared.\n\nYou know, if you look just at the government’s own guidelines, the kinds of information that are in here are presumptively classified. So I don’t know where the basis for this claim—I could take a stab at why I think politically they’re making it—but as a legal or a sort of security matter, I don’t know what the foundation for that claim is.\n\nEbeid: Since that response, The Atlantic published the text of the Signal chat, including information that was previously left out of Monday’s story. So what can you tell me about making that decision?\n\nHarris: Well, there were two things that were driving that for us. One was that, you know, to our surprise, officials—including, you know, the DNI, the CIA director, the White House spokesperson, and ultimately the president himself—weighed in on this on Tuesday, saying that the information in the thread was unclassified. Which was, you know, kind of just say, Okay, well, then is it not considered sensitive? I mean, can this be shared?\n\nAnd the other thing was that administration officials, including the president, were attacking our journalism. And they were implying or claiming that we were deceiving the public, that if the public saw them, they would see that actually, you know, Jeff and the editors of The Atlantic were lying to them about what they really said.\n\nAnd so I think that we felt an obligation in that way to show people, Look—this is what is in these messages. You can decide for yourself if we’re being honest with you. And by the way, this is everything that the president says is unclassified and his top advisers say is unclassified.\n\nEbeid: And, you know, the idea of what counts as classified information and what doesn’t, who determines what’s classified, and when it’s classified—these are not new questions in your line of work. But for people without your background, can you tell us a little bit more about how we should think about these arguments around what it means for something to be classified?\n\nHarris: So think of it this way: Information is classified. By information, I’m talking about—it could be anything, and the government classifies a lot of things. It’s classified according to the damage that would be done if the information were publicly released. So you have different levels of classification.\n\nYou have “Secret.” Above that, you have “Top Secret.” Above that, you have something called “Top Secret / SCI.” And then even within that level, you have different, what are called, “compartments” of information. That is essentially information that can only be known by those with a need-to-know who are read into a particular compartment, so the really kind of super-secret stuff, you can think of it.\n\nAnd those labels are put on pieces of information to let people in the government who are handling this information know how to handle it, how much to restrict it, who’s allowed to see it. It’s essentially like a coding system that, again, is based on the damage that would be done if it were known outside of these closed circles of people who need to know it.\n\nSo who decides what information is classified? Senior-level government officials often have that authority. Secretaries of defense, of state have what’s called “original classification authority.” Pete Hegseth can mark something classified if he wants to. He can also begin the process to declassify something if he wants to do that.\n\nAnd this really is, I mean, usually something that is done on an agency-by-agency or department-by-department basis. So the Defense Department kind of categorizes all of its classified information. And the CIA does the same for its classified information. And it really, it’s just—I mean, when we talk about something being classified, usually what it really means at base is: It’s sensitive. It’s information that the agency doesn’t want a lot of people to know about or doesn’t want people outside the kind of cleared circle to know about. That’s probably the best way to think about it.\n\nEbeid: And you saw the texts. Based on what you know, is there a category that you would have put those texts? A level of classification?\n\nHarris: I would’ve presumed they were top secret, which is not to say that that’s the most most secret, but I would’ve presumed that they were at least top secret, because you’re talking about information about a military attack that’s about to happen.\n\nYou know, Hegseth is sharing things like the time that F-18s are going to launch, when they will be releasing their weapons, what the follow-on attacks will be, by what kind of aircraft, by what kind of weapons. This is sensitive information because if this fell into the hands of an adversary, the adversary is going to know how to try to avoid the attack or potentially launch a counterattack, which then, that could also jeopardize the lives of U.S. forces, who are already, you know, flying into harm’s way because the Houthis have antiaircraft capabilities. They can try to shoot these planes down, and we know that.\n\nSo why would you want information like this to be in an unsecured channel, where it could fall into the hands of somebody who could, you know, give it to your adversary? And obviously, that didn’t happen here, but this case kind of exemplifies why they shouldn’t be using Signal to begin with. If they’d been having these conversations on a secure government system, it would be impossible to have added Jeffrey Goldberg to that chat.\n\nSo this is why Signal is not well suited for sharing this kind of information. Talking about things in a more broad sense or unclassified or not highly sensitive information? Sure. And lots of officials do that. And there are instances in which that is fine and condoned, but I have yet to find anybody who can tell me that this kind of information is fine to share in Signal.\n\nI just—I think it’s not. And if these officials have made a determination that it is, I think they owe the public an explanation for that. Instead, what they’ve done is insist it’s unclassified, which implies it’s not terribly sensitive, and they’ve attacked us for reporting about it.\n\nEbeid: So this isn’t the first time we’ve had a scandal around sensitive information. We’ve, of course, you know, had the Hillary Clinton email saga. There’s that Donald Trump was indicted over classified documents in Florida before the case was dropped after his election. Could you put this breach in the context of those past episodes?\n\nHarris: Yeah. I think if you take the Hillary Clinton email server kind of at one end of severity, which is to say kind of a lower end—it’s not insignificant; I want to emphasize that—and then you put the Donald Trump taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago, for which he’s indicted, at the high end of severity, because here we’re talking about boxes of paper classified documents in an unsecured place, lots of people milling about, I think that this Signal chat falls somewhere in the middle of that. And maybe closer to the Hillary Clinton email side.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is because, look: If Jeff had not been in the room, it’s possible that these would’ve been the only people who knew about it. So that’s to some degree, as in to say, these officials—who are all clear to have this information, by the way—there’s no question that they’re allowed to see what was in the room.\n\nIt’s a question of the way it was transmitted, and the risk that goes with that. There is the obvious risk that, you know, someone could be in the room that wasn’t supposed to be there. But there’s another risk that we haven’t talked about, which is that the devices themselves, the phones on which Signal is running for these 17 or so officials, could those phones have been compromised by a foreign government or by a criminal government?\n\nEbeid: Right. Could they be hacked?\n\nHarris: Could they be hacked? Exactly. And if they were hacked, that means somebody could theoretically be reading the messages as if they were standing there holding the phone themselves.\n\nAnd this is not theoretical. The government, just in recent days, has put out guidance to people who are using Signal, including officials who are using it, warning them about the vulnerabilities that Signal has to foreign-intelligence services. And there are questions about, was Signal running on these officials’ government phones, which we would hope have a pretty high degree of security, or their personal phones, which are under their personal recognizance that might not be as secure as a government phone? So that, I think, tilts it a little more towards the severe side, but I think it’s in the middle of those two scandals.\n\nEbeid: What consequences do you expect for the officials who are on the group chat? Actually, maybe I should ask, given your years of experience, how would you typically expect an administration to respond to this kind of situation?\n\nHarris: The typical response to this would be—I think it’d be twofold.\n\nOne, I think the officials would be humiliated. They’d be highly embarrassed, and if they were thinking about their reputations would probably try to come out and maybe try and do something to soften the blow, but essentially take responsibility for it. I would expect in any other administration, the national security adviser probably would’ve offered the president his resignation, and the president might have taken it.\n\nThe other thing that would happen here is that there would be an investigation, and probably the FBI would do that investigation. The reason for that is: Although this is a very novel example of a classified leak—putting aside that the government says it’s not classified—it’s still a leak. It’s still a leak, and when there is sensitive information that falls into the hands of people who aren’t supposed to have it, the FBI usually investigates that, particularly if—you know, it’s publicly known in this case. But the agencies in question whose information was implicated, what they would normally do is refer that to the FBI and say: We’d like you to investigate this and find out how it happened.\n\nAnd then, of course, part of that investigation would be to determine whether or not there are criminal charges that should be filed. I don’t think that’s likely to happen in this case. I don’t think it’d be likely to happen, by the way, in another administration. The law—this is a strange case. I don’t imagine anyone would be prosecuted, but they’re certainly not gonna be prosecuted in the Trump administration.\n\nEbeid: There is a lawsuit now filed against administration officials for, you know, violating federal recordkeeping laws. Do you think something could come of that?\n\nHarris: Now, that’s possible. I mean, there’s a question of standing. You know, does the plaintiff have standing to bring it? But it’s a really good point. It’s worth just dwelling on a second. There are two records laws that are implicated here: the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act.\n\nAnd in a nutshell, what they require is that if people are going to use a text-messaging service—or any electronic service, for that matter—that’s not an official one, that’s not, like, a .gov service, they’ve gotta make a backup of those communications if they are pertaining to official matters. CIA Director John Ratcliffe actually was testifying earlier this week and mentioned this very fact as a way of defending the CIA’s use of Signal—or what he characterized as the CIA’s use of Signal—which he portrayed as widespread.\n\nI’m not really sure that’s true, but he accurately said that you have to keep a record of these messages if you’re sending them. So there might be some legs to a lawsuit that alleges these officials were violating those records laws.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: More with Shane Harris after the break.\n\n\n\n[Break]\n\nEbeid: You know, Shane, I think I’ve received more text messages—and I should say, messages in Signal—about this story than anything in a very long time.\n\nHarris: Do people want to make a “Houthi PC small group” chat room too?\n\nEbeid: Oh man, let me tell you, all my groups have been renamed this week. But I can’t imagine what kind of responses you’re getting. What are you hearing from people in the intelligence community?\n\nHarris: I think people—what I’m hearing is a mix of people being appalled, outraged, a lot of, If I had done this, I’d be fired. If I had done this, I would be investigated and indicted. There’s a real sense of anger, I think, at what people see as the hypocrisy of these officials and sort of having a “fine for me and not for thee” attitude when it comes to what is ultimately just a really reckless use of technology. I really don’t think there’s any way around that. And I think a real sense, too, among people, including people who don’t work in the government, who I’ve talked to—a real feeling that nothing will happen as a result of this and that no one will be held accountable and that that’s a real shame.\n\nEbeid: And you know, obviously, like, we’re focusing on this one text conversation that happened to include Jeffrey Goldberg. I mean, would it be reasonable for us to assume that this is not the first and only conversation that’s happening like this in Signal or other group-chat environments?\n\nHarris: I think that’s reasonable, and I presume it’s not the only one. And the reason I do is because in this whole conversation that we’re watching them have, not one person says: Hey—should we be doing this on Signal? Why did you add him to this group? Wait, why are we doing this on a text thread?\n\nEveryone behaves as if this is perfectly normal. And to my knowledge, at least in previous administrations, it is not normal. That suggests, to me, that these people have either done this before or know people have done it before.\n\nEbeid: We have been very, you know, in the last couple of days around this story and even in this conversation, we’re very focused on what this means internally in the United States for us. A couple of weeks ago, you were on the show, talking with our host, Hanna Rosin, about this administration’s about-face from European allies and what kind of effect that has on the intelligence community and sharing of information between the U.S. and countries that we’ve traditionally thought of as allies. What kind of fallout could we see with intelligence sharing with other countries after something like this?\n\nHarris: I think this is likely to confirm for our allies that they were right to be skeptical about this administration’s ability to properly handle sensitive information, and that they will start pulling back accordingly.\n\nI think they already have been. And look—in the two days since this story has broken, I’ve had a chance to talk to officials in some allied countries. They’re appalled. They can’t believe this is happening, and they are very candid in saying, you know, This is essentially why we have to rethink whether we can trust this administration.\n\nAnd you know, what’s also so striking to me in some of these conversations is: As aghast as they are, they’re not actually surprised. It’s not that they can’t believe that anyone would do this. It’s more that they think that if anyone were going to do it, it would be people in this administration.\n\nBecause there’s a track record. There has been since the inauguration, and there’s a track record in Trump’s first term. So you know, people are also—you know, like all of us, they’re kind of laughing. I mean, it’s just—there’s a deep comic thread to this story. (Laughs.) No doubt.\n\nEbeid: So many memes.\n\nHarris: So many memes. The memes have been amazing. It’s been one of the best parts. But they’re also taking it really seriously because now they have an actual example, proof that there is information being bandied about in this way. And, you know, I was talking to someone just recently, you know, who said, So are we to assume that you’re gonna take the intelligence that we give you from our country, and you’re also gonna be sharing it with people over Signal? Because that’s not okay.\n\nEbeid: Right. Okay. So that’s the situation with historic allies. What about America’s adversaries? What kind of conversations do you think are happening right now in North Korea and China?\n\nHarris: I think, you know, again, aside from the comedy of it, look: We have these individuals—particularly, the very senior members of the administration, the DNI, the CIA director, the secretary of defense, and to include their senior aides—already are presumably at the top of the target list for foreign intelligence services to try and get information on them, compromise their electronic devices.\n\nWhat I’m afraid this episode will show to those foreign spy agencies is that work of spying on our officials might be easier than they had thought it would be. And I don’t think we should presume for a minute that all of the phones that were used in this Signal chain are a hundred percent secure.\n\nI’m not saying I know them not to be, but I would not presume that they are. I think that there is kind of a pattern of sloppy behavior by senior members of the administration with how they take briefings, with people they have around them, and whether those people have been appropriately cleared, the kinds of communication systems that they’re using.\n\nI don’t think we should view this Signal group as a one-off. I think that this is illustrative of a pattern of behavior and practice that we have seen since President Trump took office, in January. You know, and we’ve talked before and I’ve written before about, you know, the counterintelligence and security risks that happen or get created when people from the DOGE service start barging into agencies and mucking about in computer systems that they don’t really understand, and the way that they can expose information or make it more vulnerable.\n\nSo I think about that and other threads that I’m kind of pulling on and say: The way to think about the “Houthi PC small group” Signal scandal is as part of a whole pattern of behavior, not as something that happened in isolation.\n\nEbeid: Shane, thanks so much for joining me today.\n\nHarris: Thank you for having me, Claudine.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West and edited by Kevin Townsend.

        "title": "Why We’re Still Talking About the ‘Trauma Plot’",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Nothing amplifies a popular trend more than a prominent critic making a noisy case against it. In her 2021 polemic, “The Case Against the Trauma Plot,” the literary critic Parul Sehgal argued that trauma had become a central feature of contemporary literature. In too many recent novels, she observed, characters looked to the buried pain of the past as an explanation for the present; this type of story, she said, “flattens, distorts, reduces character to symptom.” The essay sparked an ongoing debate in the literary community: Has trauma indeed become the dominant plot, and is fiction worse off for it? Or is processing a difficult past on the page still valuable, both for the writer and the reader?\n\nJamie Hood defiantly sets out to reclaim the trauma plot by doubling down on it, beginning with the title of her debut memoir, Trauma Plot: A Life. Implicit in her project is an acknowledgment that human beings will always have deeply upsetting experiences, and they will always write about them. The only question is how. Hood tries to answer that question through an utterly original recounting of her own past.\n\nHood is a shrewd critic, and she is informed by the work of authors including Virginia Woolf, Anne Sexton, and Sylvia Plath, whose writings allow her to challenge the idea that there’s something uniquely contemporary about trauma plots (or indeed in the criticism of them). Hood is troubled by Sehgal’s framing of the phenomenon, which seems to “exile” writers “from self-knowledge.” She identifies what she sees as an underlying assumption guiding arguments against this kind of writing—that those who write books about their pain are not producing art: “Like there’s no reason to write about trauma except to make a buck. Like if you talk about having lived through something awful, that’s all you’ve ever talked about or ever will. Like you have no agency inside a story you yourself choose to tell.”\n\nRead: Trauma is everywhere. Write about it anyway.\n\nIn Trauma Plot, Hood investigates her past and present with startling honesty and curiosity. “I began writing this book in 2016, a year after five men gang raped me and around the time the Access Hollywood tapes were leaked to the public,” she writes. The #MeToo movement demonstrated to Hood that experiences of sexual assault were not “exceptional,” and that they could be spoken about and shared. The accounts she read broke the silence that frequently surrounds rape, and refused to fall into existing narratives of shame or victimhood.\n\n“For most of my life no one I knew talked about rape,” Hood writes, “so there were many years when I thought it happened to every heroine of every Lifetime movie and to me.” These kinds of films, she writes, smooth over the experience of rape into straightforward cause and effect: Sexual assault leads to grieving and then healing, which a brave heroine can achieve by looking for some kind of lesson. Hood searches for new ways to tell her story, forms that depart from familiar scripts.\n\nOne place where Hood finds such inspiration is in the myth of the Athenian princess Philomela, from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. While on her way to visit her sister, Philomela is deceived and raped by Tereus, her brother-in-law. When she threatens to reveal what he did, Tereus cuts out her tongue, leaving her mute. But Philomela learns to weave, creating a tapestry that tells the story of her assault. Hood imagines herself as Philomela, finding alternative means of expressing the truth: “I had a need of my own to reckon with the way rape resists testimony or explodes the containers of its own telling, without in turn surrendering to the convention that trauma is, as it were, altogether intelligible. With tongue or without, the story will out.”\n\nLike Philomela, Hood experiments with structure to speak the unspeakable and show the splintering effects of sexual assault (in her case, what she describes as several separate incidents of rape). Trauma Plot is divided into four parts, each of which is written from a different perspective: “She,” “I,” “You,” “We.” In each section, Hood doesn’t just try to understand her own experiences; she wrestles with the limits of language when trying to represent deep personal pain.\n\nPart I, “She,” is an homage to Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, following a character Hood calls Jamie H. (in the third person) on the day she and her roommate are planning to throw a party. In Boston in October 2012, Jamie wakes up, commutes to Waltham, teaches classes, meets with an adviser, and, yes, buys the flowers herself, all while she is haunted by what she calls the “Specter”—a leering, disembodied smile that has followed her since that summer. She searches for traces of a “fracturing” June night in her diary; though she knows what happened to her, she is “unable to look on it directly, for it signaled a kind of cognitive eclipse.” Near the end of the section, Jamie finally confronts the event, revealing that a man she calls the Diplomat raped her. Here, the perspective snaps from “she” to “I,”; Jamie reflects that she “must yield the mantle of the third person” in order to “face the Diplomat stripped of distance.”\n\nThis “I” is the dominant voice of Part II, which begins, “Two months before the bombing of the Boston Marathon I was raped again.” Here, Hood employs the kind of first-person testimony common to the trauma plot. But she tells her story at a slant, intertwining her second rape and its aftermath with an account of the Boston Marathon bombing, a triple murder in Waltham, and her decision to leave Boston for New York City. In February 2013, Hood describes being drugged and assaulted by “the Man in the Gray Room,” who then offers to drive her home the next morning. The entire chapter seems to snag on that detail, as Hood imagines it undermining her account: “That accepting this from him would undercut the veracity of my victimization didn’t matter, because nothing did. The decision was automatic, and marvelously practical. I’d no clue where I was, no money, and could barely walk. I knew already I wouldn’t report, so there’d be no rape kit, no interrogation or lawyers, no judge, no testimony, no jury.”\n\nYet Hood knows that her book is a testimony. She writes about her memories carefully, always aware that her reader is forming judgments about her credibility. To such people, Hood shows viscerally how the idea of the perfect victim, beyond reproach or doubt, is a fantasy. After all, she still has to live: “In the movies, they make it seem like your whole life stops when you get raped, but I kept arriving at the awful truth that nothing about it would stop, and I still had to wake up each day and do the same stupid, boring shit I did every other day and would have to go on doing until the end.” As she juggles teaching, writing a dissertation, grading papers, and working extra hours as a transcriptionist, Hood dissociates, turning to alcohol, drugs, and calorie restriction.\n\nIn the introduction to her book, Hood writes that “I am, I confess, not a theorist of rape, only an archivist of my own.” In the final two sections, she fully embraces this role: Part III, “You,” set in New York in August 2013, revisits her journals from that period, separating Hood the diarist (earnest, hurting, recently arrived in a new city) from Hood the biographer (critical, distant, seasoned). Here she wryly quotes passages from her old writings, puncturing her past fantasies: “It seems to me,” she writes to her earlier self, “you’ve no notion of what you yourself desire.”\n\nPart IV, “We,” is set in the present, as Hood begins therapy. Perhaps the most gripping part of “We” is when Hood assembles a chronology of her “life and trauma” for her therapist, Helen. “What if I pretended that the plot was linear, and of a piece?” she writes. Hood never shows this chronology to Helen, but lays it out—with some redactions—for the reader. This document is powerful to read toward the end of the memoir: It makes clear just how much Trauma Plot resists linear storytelling in order to reflect the disordered, fragmented experience of sexual assault.\n\nRead: In search of the book that would save her life\n\nHood doesn’t indicate whether she feels like she has healed from her past, or what it would look like if she had. But Trauma Plot unambiguously demonstrates her growth as a writer. Like Philomela, Hood alchemizes her suffering into something new. In her first book, the essay-poetry hybrid How to Be a Good Girl: A Miscellany, she mentioned the memoir she was trying to write. “I bite the inside of my cheek & say (again) this is not my rape / book this is not my rape book this is not my rape book / every book is my rape book,” she wrote; “my rape book is 300 pages long & / i will never finish writing it.” I was moved to reach the end of Trauma Plot and realize that Hood has finished her “rape book” (or one of them) and written it according to her own rules.\n\n\n\nIn a session with Helen, Hood talks about her sense of wasted time. “I’m nearly forty and I’ve only just started living,” she reflects. “I want to be OK with this. But it’s hard not to dream of other lives, and maybe that dream is the current that carries me to writing.” This is the parallel plot of the book—Hood’s artistic development alongside her pain. She ends with a burst of hope that calls to mind Molly Bloom’s ecstatic soliloquy at the end of James Joyce’s Ulysses: “I have hope again! I do! I don’t know my desire, yes, and yet I’m filled with it. And I think, yes, of all I still have to write. Everything left to do.” Hood’s engagement with her own trauma plot doesn’t flatten or distort her story; instead, it expands her craft, her ambition, her desire, and her life.",

Before his confirmation, over 22,000 doctors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject his appointment. During the confirmation hearing, several senators grilled him on his concerning history related to vaccine misinformation: things like his founding of an anti-vax organization, his concerning anti-vax rhetoric, and his history of suing vaccine manufacturers, something he stands to make a lot of money doing.\n\nThe former environmental lawyer was propelled to the nation’s highest health office largely by the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement, a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. As health secretary, Kennedy wants to solve the chronic disease epidemic in the US, which plenty of doctors can get behind. The issue is that he aims to do it at the expense of infectious disease research. Therein lies the problem. Most people can agree when he says things like, “I’m supportive of vaccines” and “I want good science.” The trouble is that his definition of “good” is, well — let’s call it historically shaky. In March, he appointed a well-known vaccine skeptic to head a study on the long-debunked potential link between vaccines and autism.\n\nSo what’s next? Can RFK Jr. take away vaccines that are already on the market? It’s unlikely, but he doesn’t need to. Kennedy sits at the helm of the very department he’s been undermining for years. In that position, the power he has over vaccine policy isn’t limitless, but the changes he can make could ripple for decades.\n\nYou can find this video and more on our YouTube channel.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

But, I mean, I basically tell them: ‘We have a long way to go, you know. It’s very early in the administration.’”\n\nAbout whether he’d been presented with “potential plans” for a third term: “Well, there are plans. There are — not plans. There are, there are methods which you could do it.”\n\nAsked about a specific scenario where Vice President JD Vance wins in 2028 and passes the baton back to Trump: “Well, that’s one. But there are others too.” (He declined to name the others.)\n\nAbout whether he was serious: “No, no, I’m not joking.” (Check the transcript here .)\n\nThe Logoff The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

The Constitution’s 22nd amendment says, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Trump was elected in 2016 and 2024 and does not have the support he needs to change or repeal that amendment. To serve a third term, Trump would have to violate the Constitution.\n\nSo is this a crisis for our democracy? If Trump said he was definitely running for a third term or took any steps in that direction, it would be a full-blown and immediate crisis — a president stating his intention to remain in power regardless of a constitutional prohibition. This isn’t that, but by even asserting a right to serve a third term, Trump is opening the door. That alone is concerning, and a reason to watch this topic extremely closely.\n\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…",

The operation was raising some 75,000 birds for Mountaire Farms, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken company.\n\nWhen the investigator Joseph Allman entered one of the facility’s sprawling barns, he found chickens packed wall to wall, including three dead, decaying birds. The place smelled “awful and noxious,” he said, and as he waded through the barn’s “blanket of chickens,” Allman found plenty more dead animals. Right outside the barn, Allman told me recently, there was a massive pile of manure “completely littered with dead bodies and body parts.”\n\nOver the following year, the investigators returned to the farm and also visited another operation in the area raising birds for Mountaire, where they found similar conditions. In January, Sherstin Rosenberg — a veterinarian who reviewed the footage — wrote that there were multiple birds “unable to reach food or water due to severe limb deformity and disease, or because they are stuck on their backs and unable to get up.” Several dead birds, the footage showed, had been “left to decompose for days to weeks,” according to Rosenberg.\n\nThe investigators also obtained a trove of inspection documents from two Mountaire Farms slaughterhouses through a Freedom of Information Act request, which revealed instances of birds being scalded alive, buried alive, suffocated to death, amputated, diseased, and contaminated with feces.\n\nBonnie Klapper, a former assistant US attorney, reviewed the investigators’ footage and wrote an opinion in January arguing that the conditions documented constitute criminal animal cruelty under Maryland state law. The activists have sent Klapper’s opinion and Rosenberg’s veterinary analysis to a number of county and state authorities requesting an investigation into the company and charges for animal cruelty. They haven’t received much interest.\n\nMountaire alleges that early one morning in mid-February, Allman and his colleague Adam Durand posed as AT&T contractors to gain access to a Mountaire slaughterhouse in Delaware. They were later arrested for criminal impersonation — a charge which was soon dropped — and trespassing, to which they agreed to a plea deal to remove the charge from their records in exchange for one year of no contact with Mountaire, Allman told me. Mountaire sued the two in early March for trespassing.\n\n“This lawsuit isn’t about protecting their business — it’s about silencing whistleblowers,” Allman wrote to me in response to the lawsuit. Durand declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nMountaire Farms declined an interview request for this story, but emailed a statement to Vox. The company said it requires its contract farmers to “follow sound poultry management practices that conform to practices of good animal husbandry and animal welfare.” Mountaire declined to comment further on the allegations lodged by Allman and his fellow investigators.\n\nOne of the many dead chickens Allman and his fellow investigators found.

Many chickens have difficulty walking due to industry breeding practices, and some die of dehydration or starvation if they can’t reach food or water. Joseph Allman\n\nHowever grisly the investigation into Mountaire’s operations was, they’re far from unusual. At US chicken factory farms, overcrowded, unhygienic conditions are so common that 6 percent of the nation’s 9 billion chickens raised for meat — chickens that have been bred to be unhealthily large — die on the farm each year before they can even be trucked to the slaughterhouse. That adds up to more than half a billion unnecessary deaths.\n\nThe alleged conditions on Mountaire’s chicken facilities show one of the major ills of the factory farming system in the US, one shared by other companies in the industry: an almost willful disregard for the welfare of the animals they raise. But Mountaire also demonstrates to a greater extent than any other poultry company a less widely known way in which the factory farming system’s tentacles work their way into American life: the industry’s ties to a right-wing, deregulatory political agenda.\n\nWhile Republican politicians and meat companies have long been intertwined — almost 80 percent of the industry’s political contributions in the 2024 election cycle went to Republicans — Mountaire and its wealthy but little-known CEO Ronald Cameron show just how deep those ties can go. Cameron, who at times has been a top donor to President Donald Trump, far outspends others in the poultry industry in an apparent effort to bend US politics toward his hard-right beliefs, and seemingly to protect and expand a poultry empire that produces roughly 1 out of every 13 chickens consumed in America today, even if relatively few people have ever heard of it.\n\nProcessing Meat A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nHow Mountaire Farms has fueled a right-wing business and political agenda\n\nIn 2016, Cameron and his wife gave millions to Trump-aligned PACs, which made him one of the biggest donors to Trump. Across the 2020 and 2024 election cycles, Cameron gave another $4.7 million.\n\nCameron has also contributed to several current and former House Freedom Caucus members and far-right Senate candidates, as well as over $14 million to political action committees (PACs) linked to the Koch Brothers and over $2 million to PACs operated by the Club for Growth.\n\nAll told, Cameron has given around $75 million to candidates, PACs, and state parties since 2014 — over 99 percent of it to Republicans — making him one of the 50 biggest political contributors in recent election cycles.\n\nWhile the direction of Cameron’s dollars isn’t unusual in the meat industry, the scale of giving dwarfs that of his competitors. Since 1990, the largest chicken companies have given — through their employees — anything from tens of thousands to a few million dollars each, with similar spending in direct lobbying. (Mountaire, it should be noted, doesn’t spend on lobbying at all.) The only company that comes close is Tyson Foods, which has spent $35 million on lobbying since 1998 and whose employees have given approximately $7.7 million to political candidates and organizations since 1990. However, Tyson Foods is a much bigger company than Mountaire, with 20 times the annual revenue. It’s a top producer of beef and pork, too.\n\nAll the while, according to Glassdoor salary reporting, Mountaire Farms’ frontline slaughterhouse employees make minimum wage or slightly above it to perform one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Mountaire workers have accused the company of retaliation, discrimination, denial of bathroom breaks, union-busting, wage-fixing, and exposure to harmful chemicals. In 2020, an employee interviewed by the New Yorker called the work “slavery.” Mountaire did not respond to Vox for a request for comment about allegations made by its employees.\n\nAn aerial photo, taken by drone, above a wastewater treatment operation at a Mountaire Farms slaughterhouse in Delaware. Joseph Allman\n\nThe company has also been accused of creating severe environmental pollution. In 2021, Mountaire agreed to a historic $205 million deal to settle a lawsuit alleging that one of its slaughterhouses had contaminated the drinking water and air quality of nearby residents. “While Mountaire does not believe that it caused any damage to any of the plaintiffs, it chose to settle the case in order to achieve a final resolution and to allow construction of a new wastewater treatment plant to proceed,” the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nEnvironmental pollution is a consistent problem for the meat industry, and Cameron’s political generosity has coincided with beneficial political action for Mountaire on exactly that subject.\n\nIn Maryland, where corporations are restricted from giving political candidates large sums of money, Mountaire funneled $250,000 into the Republican Governors Association days before the 2014 election, which it spent on ads to elect Republican Maryland governor Larry Hogan.\n\nOn inauguration day, Hogan rescinded regulations pertaining to how much animal manure can be spread onto crop fields as fertilizer — a notorious source of water pollution on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, where Allman and his colleagues investigated Mountaire chicken operations. Weeks later, Hogan proposed a watered-down version with a loophole for the poultry industry. A spokesperson for Hogan told the Wall Street Journal that Hogan “had no knowledge of [Mountaire’s] involvement with the Republican Governors Association.”\n\nIn the middle of April 2020, Trump picked Cameron to serve as an economic adviser to the White House on its strategy to reopen parts of the economy in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Two weeks later, Trump signed an executive order mandating that slaughterhouses remain open to their extent possible, even as they became Covid hot spots — including Mountaire slaughterhouses.\n\nThat same day, the Department of Labor issued a statement that essentially immunized meat companies from being held accountable if they didn’t adhere to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Covid-19 guidelines so long as they had at least demonstrated a “good faith” effort to do so. Around the same time, the US Department of Agriculture permitted 15 slaughterhouses — including one of Mountaire’s — to speed up their slaughter lines from 140 birds per minute to 175.\n\nWhy the meat industry gives so much to Republicans\n\nMountaire may stand out in the size of its contributions to right-wing politicians and groups, but the broader meat and dairy industry gives overwhelmingly to Republicans.\n\nThe industry’s political favoritism can be explained in part by geography; animal agriculture is concentrated in rural states where politicians are much more likely to be Republican. But it can also be explained in part by ideology; Congressional Republicans tend to prefer deregulation, which benefits meat, dairy, and egg companies.\n\nCameron and his company — along with his competitors — benefit from deregulation at each link in the supply chain that Congress and regulatory agencies could change but don’t. Poultry farms are exempt from numerous animal welfare laws and are largely exempt from key environmental laws. The Department of Labor, across Republican and Democrat administrations, has failed to keep slaughterhouse abuses in check. A lot of the farmers that raise chickens for big poultry companies get screwed over, too.\n\nBut while Republicans may financially benefit disproportionately from the industry’s largesse, Democrats tend to be anything but tough on the meat industry.\n\n“While conservatives have consistently pushed more aggressive, pro-agribusiness policies,” food policy expert Nathan Rosenberg and journalist Bryce Wilson Stucki wrote in a 2017 story for The Counter, “liberals have often responded with pro-agribusiness policies of their own, even when that meant undermining their own natural allies: small and mid-sized farmers, farm workers, rural minority populations, and the small, independent businesses they support.” I saw that reality myself when I wrote last year about the cozy relationship between the meat industry and Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris’s VP pick.\n\nAlexandra Paul, who led the investigation into Mountaire Farms, rescues a chicken. Joseph Allman Leah, a rescued chicken, steps onto grass for the first time. Alexandra Paul, who led the investigation into Mountaire Farms, described the experience of witnessing Leah’s first steps as “magical.” Joseph Allman\n\nThere’s no clear path to breaking the meat industry’s grip over American politics on the horizon, but there is something anyone can do — starting today — to push back against the kinds of horrific allegations made against Mountaire and other poultry giants: Eat less chicken.\n\nIn 2022, the US raised and slaughtered a record-breaking 9.2 billion of them — 24 per person after accounting for poultry exports. Chicken may be branded as a healthier, more sustainable alternative to beef and pork, but its mass production and consumption — whether from Mountaire or its competitors — relies on unimaginable human and animal suffering.\n\n“We’re up against a really big system that seems really entrenched right now,” said Durand, one of the activists, “and we are just trying to do whatever we can to disrupt that.”",

Seasonal allergies are the body’s response to pollen from trees and grass; the immune system releases chemicals, like histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which cause all those uncomfortable, familiar symptoms.\n\nThe best way to combat the unpleasant barrage is to get ahead of them, says Russell Leftwich, a fellow at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and an adjunct assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Since allergy season arrives at roughly the same time every year, Leftwich recommends starting your allergy relief of choice for a few days before pollen levels get too high. (The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, and IQAir provide local pollen monitoring.)\n\nIf the dizzying variety of drugs at the pharmacy has you confused, here are a few things to know about the most effective types of over-the-counter allergy medications as well as non-pharmaceutical ways to keep your allergies in check.\n\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBefore heading to the drugstore\n\nOne of the best ways to alleviate allergy symptoms is to prevent pollen from getting into your body in the first place. This means keeping windows closed and wearing a mask while doing yard work, Leftwich says. If you’ve been outdoors for a while, change your clothes and wash your face when you get home, says Rita Kachru, the chief of allergy and immunology in the department of medicine at UCLA.\n\nRelated 4 tips for dealing with a ferocious allergy season\n\nAnother prevention method includes rinsing your nose with a saline solution: a mixture of baking soda, salt, and distilled or boiled water, Kachru says. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends mixing three tablespoons of iodide-free salt with one teaspoon of baking soda in a small container. Then add one teaspoon of the salt/baking soda mixture to eight ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. You can also buy nasal saline sprays at the drugstore.\n\nWhen to take antihistamines\n\nWhen avoidance strategies aren’t totally effective, you can treat your symptoms with over-the-counter allergy medications. One of the major categories of these treatments are antihistamines, which are available in pill, tablet, eye drop, or nasal spray forms.\n\nAntihistamines help reduce itchiness and sneezing and are your first line of defense, Kachru says. “The reason I always start with an antihistamine is because you may just have a day of a high pollen count,” she says, “and you just need a one-time antihistamine because you’re sneezing and you’re itchy and you’re a little congested.”\n\nKachru and Leftwich suggest opting for long-acting antihistamines — like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or fexofenadine (Allegra) — over short-acting ones. People can develop a resistance to short-acting antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), very quickly. Plus, Benadryl often makes people sleepy.\n\nBoth short- and long-acting antihistamines provide relief within 15 to 30 minutes, Kachru says. Take them at the start of the day before you are exposed to pollen.\n\nFor mild nose itchiness and sneezing, an antihistamine nasal spray, like azelastine (Astepro), might work for you. A common side effect is a metallic taste in the back of the throat, Kachru says.\n\nWhen to try nasal steroid sprays\n\nIf you’re reaching for an antihistamine three to four times a week, Kachru suggests adding a nasal steroid into the mix. Not only do nasal steroids reduce sneezing and itchiness, but they’ll help with congestion, too. These include fluticasone (Flonase), budesonide (Benacort), triamcinolone (Nasacort), and mometasone (Nasonex). Nasal steroids do take a few days until you feel the full effects, Kachru says, so don’t give up if you don’t feel better right away.\n\nTo properly administer nasal sprays, insert the tip in your nostril and point it toward your ear. A common mistake when using a nasal spray is pointing it straight up your nose. “It goes up their nose, down their throat and does nothing for them,” Kachru says. “Or they stick it inwards into their nose, and then they get nosebleeds. … So you want to always make sure that when you put it in, you point it out towards your ear, spray, sniff in, and then do the alternate nostril.”\n\nWhile not a nasal steroid, Kachru advises against using oxymetazoline (Afrin), a nasal spray decongestant. “Patients who use Afrin regularly end up having really, really severe rebound nasal congestion,” she says.\n\nLeftwich advises against decongestants more broadly, as the over-the-counter decongestant medications are not very effective.\n\nAfter a few weeks of daily nasal spray use, you may consider stopping an antihistamine, if you’re taking both. “That’s usually what I tell people to do,” Kachru says. “Eventually just use that antihistamine as needed” because the nasal spray is more effective.",

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut that’s a much narrower definition of reasoning than a lot of people might have in mind. Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "content": "is a senior politics reporter at Vox, where he covers the Democratic Party. He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic’s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nWhen Michelle Obama announced in March that she and her brother were starting a podcast, it dug up a familiar feeling for Democrats: yearning.\n\nIf only the uber-popular former first lady would just return to politics. She could just run for president, if she wanted.\n\nIt’s a recurring wish, for an Obama to save the Democratic Party. And like every time that chatter comes up, the dreamers were quickly let down. The podcast has avoided the political, and Obama herself has remained mostly out of the public eye, skipping high-profile public events and not commenting on news. She’s not alone. The party’s leaders of the past have also mostly remained silent as Donald Trump and Elon Musk challenge the law, remake the federal government, and implement the Trump 2.0 agenda.\n\nThis pining for Obama’s return isn’t new, but particularly during the second Trump term, it reflects something special about this moment: The Democratic Party still doesn’t have a clear leader, doesn’t have a clear direction of where to go, and keeps looking to the past for leadership.\n\nSome of that identity crisis is being fought out in public. Various governors are vying for the attention of voters pissed off at Trump and Republicans. They’re on podcasts and TV shows, at town halls and listening sessions. In Congress, they’re slowly figuring out how their constituents want them to resist Trump. And most notably, Sen. Bernie Sanders is wrapping up a multistate run of rallies against “oligarchy,” essentially anointing US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York his movement’s successor in front of huge crowds.\n\nStill, none of these individuals seem to be uniting the party in the way the most loyal Democrats might wish for.\n\nBut that might be okay. If history can show us anything about what Democrats do now, it’s that opposition parties need this time without a clear leader to debate their identities, rebuild grassroots energy, and prepare for midterm elections. The Democrats’ savior isn’t coming any time soon. But that may be a feature, not a bug, of losing elections.\n\nDemocrats keep looking to the past for saviors\n\nThe hope for a great savior — either a veteran voice who can right the ship or an outsider who can rock it — might actually be an impediment as the Democrats figure themselves out. While a new guard of politicians and voices are still getting their footing or pushing for more influence, the “hero” they’re looking for won’t come around for a while — meaning the party should be using this time to rebuild and have these debates.\n\n“The very fact that Democrats are looking for a savior, seeking the man or woman on the white or black horse, is a sign that they’re not really doing what good political parties do, which is work at the grassroots, recruit people to run and make the case about why what Trump and Musk are doing is horrible,” Michael Kazin, the Georgetown University political historian who’s written an extensive history of the Democratic Party, told me.\n\nAsking for a Biden or Harris return is probably not the answer.\n\nThere are some trying to make this case. Some of the loudest remaining voices on the Democratic side remain members of the old guard — Sanders, for example, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who led many protests against Trump and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s attempts to downsize the federal government in the first few weeks of the Trump presidency. Neither are positioning themselves as the next leaders of the party, but Sanders, at least, seems to be setting the stage for a younger voice. He remains the most popular national figure, but the younger voices who could succeed him or chart out a new chapter for the party are not nearly as popular.\n\nThose younger voices — like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, or Ocasio-Cortez — are polarizing or still relatively unknown. They all represent different paths forward for the party. And they’re all trying out different approaches to tap into the anger that the average Democratic voter is feeling.\n\nAnd these divisions may actually end up being helpful: They’re setting the ground for a lively Democratic presidential primary contest in two to three years, they’re offering voters an idea of what the party could still become, and all represent a new vision for the party — even if the noise right now is about the party’s disunity. They also serve a midterm purpose as well: There not being a unified Democratic leader or agenda allows individual candidates to run their own, localized races without being pegged to one figure, as they tend to be during presidential election years, like when Biden was running. So embracing that chaos and disunity might actually be a good thing.\n\n“It’s a mistake to think you just have your preexisting set of people who’ve done it before, that one of them must be a savior. And frankly, right now, as opposed to in four years, the savior isn’t going to come from one single person. I’m not convinced that’s really how it works,” Julian Zelizer, a political history professor at Princeton University, told me. “The savior might be the congressional caucuses in the House and Senate acting effectively. The saviors might be independent groups, ACLU-type groups challenging [Trump] in court. But I think it’s more an organizational moment, and in a few years, you turn to the single individual. But I don’t think there’s a superhero who’s gonna fly in right now and just totally stop this. And thinking that way is probably not constructive for Democrats.”\n\nOf course, Democrats will still be pining for a hero, a new JFK or Obama to take on the mantle of the new Democratic Party. But there’s no easy way out of the current moment of crisis. The Obamas certainly won’t be the ones to resolve it. And wanting the figures of the past to return might actually be counterproductive.\n\nThis clamor has apparently made its way to the Bidens, who reportedly have offered to fundraise, campaign, and boost Democratic candidates this year and next. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has remained quiet, while her more popular former running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has instead embarked on an “I told you so” tour as he tests the waters for a third term as governor.\n\nBut asking for a Biden or Harris return is probably not the answer.\n\n“What good is it going to do? Is it going to convince anybody [for a former president or vice president to speak up]?” Kazin said. “It’s pretty common after the party who loses the election and obviously has no clear leader, for there to be a period where it’s not clear who the leaders are going to be. That happened in some ways, after 2004 as well. Going back in history, it happened in the 1920s a lot with Democrats not winning elections, it happened after losses in 1980 and 1984 and 1988 as well. So it takes a while for that to shake out. That’s not surprising.”",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect section, with a focus on animal welfare and the future of meat.\n\nH5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza known as bird flu, continues to wreak havoc on the nation’s egg farms. Since the start of 2025, more than 30 million egg-laying hens — about 10 percent of the national flock — have fallen prey to the virus or been brutally killed by egg producers in an effort to slow its spread. It’s led to egg shortages and a spike in egg prices, which reached $5.89 per dozen on average in February, up from under $2 in 2021, before the current bird flu outbreak began.\n\nLast week, in an effort to boost egg supply, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered the state’s agriculture department to delay its cage-free egg law by an additional seven years. It was originally supposed to go into effect at the start of 2025, then got pushed to the start of 2027, and will now be pushed to 2034. The law requires eggs produced and sold in the state to come from hens raised in cage-free barns rather than in the tiny, cramped cages that are predominant in the egg industry.\n\nLast month, Nevada temporarily suspended its cage-free egg law for similar reasons, and the state’s governor has said he wants to repeal Nevada’s cage-free standards altogether.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Processing Meat newsletter Sign up here for Future Perfect’s biweekly newsletter from Marina Bolotnikova and Kenny Torrella, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. Have questions or comments on this newsletter? Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!\n\nIn January, state lawmakers in Michigan and Colorado introduced bills to do just that in their states. Colorado’s bill is dead, while Michigan’s bill is still in committee. President Donald Trump’s USDA secretary Brooke Rollins has also called for rolling back California’s Proposition 12, a landmark animal welfare law that requires eggs to be cage-free, among other reforms.\n\nThese efforts are part of a much larger, longer-term trend attempting to dismantle what little progress has been made on farm animal welfare in the US. For years, livestock industry-friendly members of Congress have pushed for the EATS Act, which would ban states from setting their own standards for livestock products imported from other states, thereby nullifying some of the most important farm animal welfare laws in the country.\n\nIt’s unlikely that efforts to repeal and suspend cage-free egg laws will lower egg prices, because there’s already little slack in the national egg supply. The whole country is facing egg shortages, so there’s not exactly a surplus of eggs lying around to fill the gap in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, and other states with cage-free laws. University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson told the Associated Press last month that Nevada’s suspension could “very slightly” ease egg prices in the state, but could also raise prices in other states by diverting some of the national egg supply to Nevada.\n\nColorado’s agriculture commissioner recently said the state’s cage-free law is not a significant factor in the shortages or price spikes. The head of the trade group Colorado Egg Producers told local media that the repeal bill “would actually harm our farmers here in the State of Colorado, and it would jeopardize the investments they’ve already made” in cage-free egg farming.\n\nIt’s an issue that both egg farmers and animal welfare advocates agree on: “Repealing state bans on cages won’t stop the spread of bird flu,” said Hannah Truxell, senior policy counsel of the animal protection group the Humane League, in a statement to Vox last month. “It would, however, reverse years of critical food industry progress.”\n\nThat progress is the rapid transition the egg industry has undertaken since the early 2000s, when virtually all egg-laying hens were confined in tiny cages that restricted them from even flapping their wings, let alone moving around. Today, 40 percent of the egg industry’s 304 million hens are cage-free, due to laws in 11 US states and commitments from major food corporations, including McDonald’s and Nestlé, to use only cage-free eggs. The shift has reduced suffering for around 100 million hens annually.\n\nThe US pioneered the development of factory farming. Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press\n\nTo be sure, cage-free doesn’t mean the animals have good lives — they’re still raised in massive, overcrowded, unsanitary barns, and investigations into cage-free farms have revealed horrid conditions. But they’re certainly better than conventional cage farms.\n\nDelaying or repealing the few laws that ban cages will do nothing to address the core food system vulnerability driving egg shortages — dependence on factory farms. Because these egg farms are so enormous, each housing hundreds of thousands or even millions of animals, a virus infecting just a couple operations can send a shock to the food supply overnight. Delaying or tearing up cage-free laws to compensate for that vulnerability will only further punish animals in the relentless pursuit of cheap food — a pursuit that is to blame for much of this mess, as poultry factory farms have supercharged the bird flu virus.\n\nAs experts increasingly worry that bird flu could boil over to create the next global pandemic, now ought to be a time for sober reflection on the risks factory farming poses, rather than a time to double down on it.\n\nBird flu is largely a problem of the factory farm industry’s own making\n\nOver the last century, the US pioneered the development of factory farming, which has since spread around the globe. It has made meat, milk, and eggs more abundant and affordable, but it has also come with a number of environmental, animal welfare, and public health problems, including accelerating the spread and virulence of H5N1.\n\nThe vast majority of America’s more than 9 billion turkeys, chickens, and egg-laying hens are raised on factory farms, where the genetically similar animals are overcrowded and live among their own waste, all of which can compromise their immune systems.\n\nFactory farms present a “huge opportunity” for a virus or microbe to effectively spread, Claas Kirchhelle, a medical historian at the University College Dublin, told me.\n\nInfluenzas have long circulated among migratory water birds, but these have historically been “low-pathogenic” strains, inflicting little to no damage to the wild birds who contract and spread it. But the virus can mutate from a low-pathogenic strain to a high-pathogenic one — which causes fatal infections in poultry birds and more effectively spreads to humans. These high-pathogenicity conversion events have occurred 42 times between 1959 and today — and almost all were first detected on poultry factory farms.\n\nExperts believe that H5N1, first detected in China in 1996, converted from low to high-pathogenicity after entering a commercial poultry farm. By the early 2000s, the virus had spread across the globe. The current US outbreak, now going on three years, has mutated to cause severe illness and death in hundreds of bird species, mammals such as seals and sea lions, and, in the US, dairy cows. More than 70 pet cats, many of them living on dairy farms, have fallen ill from bird flu, and some died. In December, a cheetah and a mountain lion at the Arizona zoo died from the bird flu.\n\nA pile of dead cows by the roadside in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The photographer said the farm owner had told her his herd had been infected with bird flu. California accounts for over 700 of the nation’s nearly 1,000 dairy cattle herds that have caught the disease. Crystal Heath\n\nSeventy Americans have contracted the virus since 2022. Most of them have been dairy or poultry farmworkers, and most cases have been mild. But in January, a Louisiana resident died after exposure to backyard chickens and wild birds. And this winter, a 13-year-old Canadian girl caught a severe bird flu infection and was hospitalized for weeks; it’s unknown how she got it.\n\nLast month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that three dairy veterinarians tested positive for H5N1 despite showing no symptoms, suggesting the virus could be more prevalent in humans than we think. Days later, a Wyoming resident with a flock of backyard chickens was hospitalized after testing positive for avian influenza.\n\nThrough it all, the US poultry and dairy industries have had little incentive to change their disease-promoting business models.\n\nPolicy incentives give them no reason to: When bird flu strikes a US poultry farm, the US Department of Agriculture covers the cost of the mass killing of the birds — which is often done by shutting off ventilation and using heaters so that the birds slowly, painfully die of heatstroke — along with the costs of carcass disposal and the market value of the birds. Since 2022, the USDA had doled out more than $1 billion in taxpayer dollars to egg producers affected by the virus. Dairy producers with bird flu outbreaks are also paid for their losses.\n\nThese bailouts — along with the current attempts to nullify or delay cage-free laws — send a message to the industry that policymakers won’t question the foundational risks of the factory farm system, and will instead continually accommodate for those risks. Delaying or temporarily suspending state cage-free egg laws may bring very slight, short-term relief on egg prices, but without pairing it with longer-term solutions, we are bound to end up here again, or worse. Influenza experts are increasingly concerned that the evolution and spread of the virus over the last few years — aided by dairy farmers unwilling to take the bird flu threat seriously and a deferential USDA — could help to trigger the next global pandemic.\n\nIn a recent story for Nautilus, journalist Brandon Keim wrote that scientists he spoke with “used phrases like ‘red lights flashing,’ ‘totally novel ballgame,’ ‘no hope of containing,’ and ‘under attack.’”\n\nReforming America’s livestock-dependent policy regime\n\nThere are a number of short- and long-term steps policymakers could take to lower the threat of bird flu.\n\nIn December, the USDA said that some producers may be “inclined to disregard biosecurity because they believe that [the USDA] will continue to cover the costs associated with damages related to an HPAI outbreak.” The agency has proposed a rule to require that producers pass a biosecurity audit before they’re eligible for indemnity payments.\n\nBut Congress could go further by requiring producers to cover their own costs for mass killing and disposing of animals in the wake of disease outbreaks — a policy that Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) proposed over two years ago in the Industrial Agriculture Accountability Act.\n\n“Our federal agricultural policy is designed in such a way that the factory farm model gets all the benefits and none of the blame,” Jake Davis, a Missouri-based agricultural policy expert and small farmer who advised on the bill, told Vox in 2022. “We have not asked the industry to embed the risk to our food system that they create.”\n\nAs egg prices soar, there’s been increased appetite for such alternatives in the US.\n\nRequiring the vaccination of egg-laying hens would help, but parts of the poultry industry are concerned it would disrupt trade, while the USDA — at the tail end of the Biden administration — expressed concerns about the effectiveness of available vaccines. In February, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said the agency is exploring the use of vaccines on poultry farms but soon walked it back. The agency is still investing in vaccine research, however.\n\nLonger term, policymakers could invest in diversifying America’s protein sources — currently, two-thirds of our protein intake comes from animal products. Fewer animals and fewer factory farms would give avian influenza and other viruses fewer opportunities to mutate and spread, while also benefitting the environment and the animals themselves.\n\nCongress, the USDA and FDA, and state governments helped to build — and still help to expand — the factory farm system. But policymakers could choose to shift the food system in a more plant-based direction. Forward-thinking countries like Denmark and the Netherlands are already doing so through programs to pay farmers to raise fewer animals or grow more plant-based crops and to support startups producing plant-based meat, milk, and egg alternatives.\n\nAs egg prices soar, there’s been increased appetite for such alternatives in the US. Josh Tetrick, the CEO of Eat Just — the maker of a plant-based liquid egg product called Just Egg, which is made with mung bean protein — told me over email in February that product sales had been growing five times faster over the previous month than in the past year. And one of the largest US retailers, Tetrick said, increased its orders of the product by 30 percent earlier this year.\n\nJust Egg is pricey, costing about triple that of liquid eggs from a caged hen, but it’s not because mung beans are expensive; it’s because it’s made by a startup that hasn’t achieved economies of scale, nor benefited from taxpayer bailouts or decades of government support like the conventional egg industry. If commercial egg farming does contribute to sparking the global pandemic, investing in plant-based alternatives will look smart in hindsight.\n\nAs Eat Just put it in a full-page New York Times advertisement in 2023: “Plants don’t get the flu.”\n\nUpdate, March 29, 6 am ET: This story was originally published on February 20 and has been updated with news that Arizona will delay its cage-free egg law, and that USDA secretary Brooke Rollins has called for repealing California’s animal welfare law Proposition 12.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nDonald Trump has said that “tariff” is the “most beautiful word in the dictionary.” And throughout his first months in office, the president has given Americans plenty of cause for googling that word’s definition.\n\nMeanwhile, they’ve left some Americans concerned and confused; tariffs arguably haven’t been this relevant to the US economy in nearly a century. So many are understandably unsure about what tariffs are, how they affect consumers, why governments would implement them, and whether the president’s policy will work on its own terms.\n\nHere’s the short answer: Tariffs are a tax on imported goods. They generally make affected consumer products more expensive. In theory, well-designed tariffs will also encourage targeted industries to produce more in the United States. And manufacturing certain goods domestically — instead of importing them from abroad —may have national security or economic benefits. Trump’s own rationales for his tariffs are numerous and shifting: The president sees them as a tool for raising revenue, enhancing national security, and revitalizing the US economy by increasing domestic manufacturing jobs. But the president’s tariffs are so broad, high, and ever-changing that they could actually backfire.\n\nWhat are tariffs? How will they affect consumers?\n\nTo understand what tariffs are — and how they work — it’s helpful to consider a concrete example. On April 3, Trump will impose a 25 percent tariff on all cars made outside the United States. This means businesses that import foreign-made automobiles — such as car dealerships — will need to pay a 25 percent tax on every foreign vehicle that they purchase.\n\nWhen a business’s costs rise, it typically tries to compensate by raising prices. And the president actually needs his auto tariffs to raise the prices of foreign cars: The official point of this tariff is to encourage Americans to buy more domestically produced cars, so that more auto manufacturers locate production in the US. If the tariff doesn’t make foreign-made cars more expensive for US consumers, it won’t give them any incentive to “buy American.”\n\nIn practice, Trump’s auto tariffs are likely to increase the prices of all cars, including American-made ones. This is for two reasons: First, US car manufacturers will need to pay tariffs on foreign-made auto parts. And second, US auto companies will face weaker competition. Previously, American carmakers couldn’t raise prices without fearing that doing so would lead potential customers to purchase a German, Japanese, or South Korean car instead. Trump’s tariffs make that much less of a concern.\n\nFor these reasons, economists have estimated that Trump’s tariffs will raise US car prices by between $4,000 and $15,000 per vehicle.\n\nThese same basic dynamics apply to tariffs on other goods. Put a tariff on foreign-made washing machines, and US retailers that import such appliances will raise prices. American washing machine makers, meanwhile, will be able to charge more due to weaker competition.\n\nAnd this actually happened: In 2018, Trump put a tariff on washing machines, which stayed in effect until 2023. During the four years that those tariffs were in place, the cost of laundry equipment in the US rose by 34 percent, much higher than the overall inflation rate over that period.\n\nTrump’s current tariffs are poised to have an even bigger impact on Americans’ finances. According to a recent estimate from the Yale Budget Lab, Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China alone could reduce the average US household’s disposable income by as much as $2,000.\n\nIf tariffs hurt consumers, why would governments impose them? What are the benefits of tariffs?\n\nThere is little question that tariffs are bad for consumers. But in theory, they could still serve a nation’s interests in at least three ways:\n\n• By generating revenue. Since tariffs are a tax, they provide the government with revenue that it can use to pay down debts or finance spending. The US government actually used tariffs as its primary revenue source from the republic’s founding until the Civil War. But since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, tariffs have become an increasingly marginal source of funds for the government.\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to change this. In fact, he has called for replacing income taxes with tariffs. And his administration claims that its auto tariffs will bring in $100 billion of revenue this year.\n\n• By nurturing highly valuable domestic industries. Many nations have successfully used tariffs to facilitate economic development.\n\nFor example, beginning in the 1960s, South Korea sought to build up its domestic car industry. But getting such an industry off the ground is difficult. In their first years of operation, South Korea carmakers had little hope of producing automobiles that were competitive with foreign ones in quality or price. By placing high tariffs on foreign-made cars, the South Korean government ensured that its domestic automakers would have a market for their less-than-stellar vehicles. Today, South Korean brands like Kia and Hyundai are globally competitive.\n\nAmerica’s car industry is much more mature today than South Korea’s was in the 1960s. But American auto manufacturers cannot make electric vehicles as efficiently as China can. Economic analysts disagree about whether it is important for America to have a globally competitive EV sector. But if we do want to nurture our electric vehicle industry, it makes some sense to put high tariffs on Chinese EVs — as both Joe Biden and Trump have done.\n\n• By improving national security. Some goods and commodities have military value. Relying on foreign nations for steel, ammunition, advanced semiconductors, or various other technologies could undermine a country’s national security — after all, foreign nations could theoretically choke off America’s access to militarily valuable technologies in the midst of a conflict. And many of Trump’s tariffs are officially intended to enhance America’s capacity to produce materials necessary for war.\n\nHow have recent administrations used tariffs?\n\nThe United States had used tariffs to nurture its infant industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries. But in the wake of World War II, America pursued the open exchange of goods across borders.\n\nWith much of Europe and Asia in ruins, US manufacturers did not need tariffs to dominate global industry. Meanwhile, America’s foreign policy establishment feared that communism would take root in Western Europe and Japan if they did not successfully rebuild their industrial economies. Therefore, to foster healthy capitalist growth abroad — while lowering prices for Americans — the US pursued tariff reduction.\n\nThe United States did occasionally enact new tariffs between the Second World War and Trump’s first election. For example, in 1987, Ronald Reagan put a 100 percent tariff on Japanese computers, televisions, and power tools, after Japan blocked US-made semiconductors from its market. But the general direction of US trade policy between Harry Truman’s presidency and Trump’s first term was toward freer trade.\n\nWhat will be the effect of Trump’s tariffs specifically?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems unlikely that Trump’s tariffs will generate reliable revenue, strengthen American manufacturing, or improve US national security. (And their odds of advancing Trump’s more peculiar trade policy goals, such as coercing Canada into becoming the 51st state, are even slimmer.)\n\nThere is a simple problem with tariffs as a revenue source: The more a tariff encourages consumers to buy domestically produced goods, the less revenue it generates. For example, if a tariff on foreign cars leads everyone to buy American vehicles, then the car tariff will cease generating revenue. Thus, for Trump’s tariffs to provide a steady source of revenue, they would need to be so low that importers continue purchasing lots of foreign-made goods (and thus paying taxes on them).\n\nBut Trump’s tariffs in many sectors are very high, precisely because he wants Americans to purchase fewer foreign-made goods. So the president’s tariffs can’t plausibly provide enough consistent revenue to offset his proposed tax cuts (let alone, to fully replace the federal income tax).\n\nMeanwhile, his tariffs could actually hurt US manufacturing for at least three reasons:\n\n• First, Trump’s tariffs apply to a vast number of industrial inputs, such as metals, energy, and electronics. This will raise costs for US manufacturers, forcing them to raise prices, which will render their products less appealing to foreign consumers. Further, tariffs on inputs will also give companies an incentive to locate factories in other countries, where they will not have to pay, for example, a 25 percent tax on parts and materials made in Canada or Mexico.\n\n• Second, Trump’s tariffs will reduce the real wages of American workers. If the average US household’s disposable income drops by $2,000, that family will likely spend less money on goods. This could ultimately reduce demand for US-made products.\n\nIndeed, the market research firm Cox Automotive believes that this is precisely what will happen with Trump’s car tariffs. In its analysis, US car plants will likely have to cut production by 30 percent, as consumers will respond to rising prices by postponing car purchases.\n\n• Third, foreign countries are retaliating against Trump’s trade policies by placing tariffs on American-made goods. And that will limit the global sales of American manufacturers. This will be especially true of America’s most innovative and advanced industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and medical equipment, which are more likely to sell their wares globally.\n\nWe’ve already seen Trump’s tariffs backfire for these reasons. According to a 2019 Federal Reserve analysis, the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term reduced manufacturing employment in affected industries.\n\nFinally, the tariffs’ hypothetical national security benefits are dubious. America’s security likely depends more on strong international alliances than the amount of steel we produce domestically. And Trump’s tariffs have antagonized America’s closest allies while undermining our nation’s credibility as a dealmaker: In 2018, Trump himself reached a trade agreement with the governments of Canada and Mexico. Yet he nevertheless applied 25 percent tariffs on both countries this year, in direct violation of his own trade deal.\n\nIf the United States is unwilling to abide by the terms of the agreements it orchestrates, other countries have less incentive to cooperate with us.\n\nIn sum, Trump’s tariffs are likely to raise prices, weaken US manufacturers, and undermine America’s alliances and global influence.\n\nHow long will Trump’s tariffs be in effect?\n\nIt’s unclear how lasting Trump’s tariffs will prove to be. The president has framed some of the duties — such as his 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico — as a potentially temporary bargaining chip in negotiations over trade and border security. But he has suggested that others will be permanent.\n\nAs the costs of Trump’s trade policies to US consumers and manufacturers mount, it is possible that the administration will decide its agenda is politically unsustainable. Already, the president’s tariffs are deeply unpopular, with 61 percent of voters disapproving of them in a recent CNN poll.",

She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nThe buzzword of the past couple of weeks is Abundance, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s new book about why we stopped being able to build things in America and how that’s destroying our country. (Klein is a co-founder of Vox and now a columnist for the New York Times; Thompson writes for the Atlantic.)\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

(Are they secret libertarians just trying to sneak deregulation into the Democratic platform? Should they be willing to speak to New Right personalities? Are they too agreeable to take on the many parts of the Democratic coalition that stand to lose if we try to build things more cheaply?)\n\nAs for me, I enjoy the book and agree with 90 percent of it, which shouldn’t be surprising from my own body of work. But I have one serious concern that I haven’t seen anyone else raise.\n\nLearning to love small government\n\nI’ve been finding myself grateful in the last few years and especially in the last few months for the existence of federalism.\n\nHere in the US it is states, not the national government, that run elections, which makes it much harder for an authoritarian in the White House to rig an election in their favor.\n\nRelated Democrats need to do something by The Gray Area with Sean Illing\n\nIt is states, not the national government, that run schools, so to change school policies the national government has to persuade the locals — or at least bribe them, as Trump is attempting to do with threats to withhold federal funds from any state that allows trans children to compete in girls’ sports. The government doesn’t directly control health care providers, so it has fewer avenues to interfere with insurance coverage of procedures it disagrees with, like transition or abortion. State and federal governments effectively no longer have the power to order neighborhoods bulldozed for highways, and I consider that a very good thing.\n\nIt’s far from all upside, of course. Federalism also allows for injustices to persist past when there’d be sufficient national support to abolish them; I expect many states still wouldn’t have legalized gay marriage if it’d been left up to the states.\n\nPart of why the word has such a bad reputation on the left is the frequency with which it was leveraged to keep the horrifying racial segregation of the pre-Civil Rights Act South from becoming a national concern. And as Abundance explores in detail, the devolution of systems to local control produces policies that can be locally popular but nationally disastrous. Few people want more housing next door, but few people are happy about the state that America’s largest cities are currently in, either.\n\nThere are very serious downsides. But the upside of our sometimes kludgy federal system is a backstop against tyranny that I, for one, have recently become very grateful for.\n\nA government that has more power is a good thing if the government will only, or at least mostly, do good things. But if you think that the government’s power will frequently be wielded to hurt you and people like you, you will rediscover a fondness for low state capacity, devolution to local control, and a system with lots and lots of veto points.\n\nIs a weak state worse than a strong one?\n\nOr maybe not. Because there is an argument that in fact, if you add too many veto points to the system, you actually end up empowering autocrats, rather than putting up barriers to them.\n\nYou could argue that people are sympathetic to actions like DOGE’s smashing and hacking through the federal bureaucracy because they feel on an intuitive level that the rules make it impossible to get anything done, so anyone who wants to act must go around the rules. And at that point, why quibble over which exact rules got broken? In this view state capacity and the rule of law reinforce each other; paralysis is unsustainable, and the ways it ruptures will usually be ugly, as we may be seeing now.\n\nI might end up finding myself persuaded by that argument, but I want to see it made. You won’t really find it in Abundance, one of the ways that makes it clear that it was initially written chiefly to influence a potential Democratic administration. Indeed, the book was originally meant to be published in the summer of 2024, right in the middle of the presidential election.\n\nBut it came out instead in March 2025, a couple of months into a second Trump administration that seems even darker than many people’s worst fears. Abundance is a vision of the future of big government, and right now every bit of news I see out of the White House makes me grateful for limits on government.\n\nI think that if the Trump administration had more state capacity, things would be worse — and I think that any progressive administration rebuilding in the aftermath of Trump should count among the failures that brought us to this stage the unwillingness to limit state power as well as the unwillingness to effectively use it. Let’s figure out how to build, absolutely. But let’s only give the state power we’ll be glad it has when our enemies are wielding it.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here!",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "This story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox’s member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today.\n\nFor millennials everywhere, two of the most glamorous and terrifying fashionistas of the 2000s were the hosts of TLC’s What Not to Wear, Stacy London and Clinton Kelly. London’s Cruella streak of white hair, Kelly’s herringbone suits — the polish! The fabulousness! The way they would cackle over a hapless victim’s mom jeans and dated ’80s perm before literally throwing their whole wardrobe in the garbage — well, the meanest eighth-grader you know would have to work hard to be that scary.\n\nWhat was most compelling of all about London and Kelly, though, was the idea that they could actually tell you what not to wear: that there were real, rigid rules to fashion, and you could learn them, if you paid close enough attention. You could learn to wear what was appropriate for your age, your profession, your physique; to draw attention away from the largest part of your body and toward the smallest; to put together a sensible blazer with a business casual wrap dress, no matter the occasion.\n\nWhat Not to Wear ended in 2013 after 10 years on the air, and Kelly and London have both since distanced themselves from the brand. Last summer, however, they announced that they would be reuniting to host a new show on Amazon Prime, one far removed from the peak of 2000s body shaming: Wear Whatever the F You Want.\n\n“The world has changed a lot since the run of ‘What Not to Wear’, and, thankfully, so have we. These days, we have zero interest in telling people what to do, based on society’s norms — because there are no more norms!” they said in a press release. “It’s time to celebrate individual style, not prescribe it.”\n\nSomehow, the ethos London and Kelly were trying to broadcast for their new show has become the prevailing attitude in the style advice world now. Celebrating individual style, rather than prescribing it, is the new imperative. The phrase that people — or at least the thousands of influencers who have supplanted fashion’s usual gatekeepers over the last 20 years — usually use is “finding your personal style,” and they seed it liberally in the titles of TikToks and YouTube videos and Instagram reels. As in: “Outfits I wore before I found my personal style,” “Ted talk on personal style,” “How to find your personal style.”\n\nIt felt as inaccessible as the idea that I could theoretically make a mid-career pivot to acting and win an Oscar.\n\nI first started seeing the phrase everywhere around 2021, just as we were emerging from pandemic lockdowns, and it felt like stumbling across a mystical and arcane concept: that my personal style existed somewhere out there, independent of my conscious mind, and all I had to do was get in touch with the tools I needed to find it.\n\nFashion-wise, I am what the kids would call a normie. I am rarely sloppy, but I frequently feel that my clothes could look better. Imagining that I could have a sense of my own style so precise and specific that I could describe it with words, could know at a glance if an article of clothing belonged to it — well, it felt as inaccessible as the idea that I could theoretically make a mid-career pivot to acting and win an Oscar. Sure, it’s technically physically possible, but what are the odds?\n\nNonetheless, I was intrigued. The discussion about finding your personal style comes with such intriguing promises. The TikTok influencers and YouTube vloggers say discovering yours will save you from falling victim to trends and the accusations of basicness that come with them. It will save you from wasting your money on clothes that you don’t like, or from contributing to the mountains of lightly used textiles that clog landfills. It’s an idea that I find profoundly seductive — and, because it is so seductive, I also find myself profoundly suspicious of it.\n\nWhen did we all get so obsessed with personal style, anyway?\n\nAt the outset of this decade, as fast fashion and TikTok converged, the trend cycle started to move very fast indeed. An abbreviated list of the styles that have risen and fallen and perhaps risen again in the last few years: pleated skirts, mini skirts, midi skirts; cardigans, ladyjackets, puffer jackets, trench coats; prairie dresses, maxi dresses, shift dresses; high-waisted pants, low-rise jeans, barrel cuts, boot cuts, flared trousers; tucked-in sweaters, crop tops, bralettes; lug-soled loafers, knee-high boots, platform shoes, gladiator sandals, etc., etc.\n\nPart of the reason the idea of finding your personal style gained such currency is that it presents an antidote to this impossibly frenetic cycle. “It bubbled up first for me on TikTok and social media,” says Rachel Tashjian, fashion critic for the Washington Post. “People would say, ‘Okay, I’m getting really fed up with all of these micro trends.’ The reaction to that is to say, ‘Don’t follow these trends, but instead find your personal style.’”\n\nOne of those making the argument that it’s both more personally fulfilling and sustainable to get off the trend treadmill is Alyssa Beltempo, a slow fashion stylist and YouTube content creator. “When you know what you love, it’s a lot harder to be swayed by what’s new and what’s trending,” Beltempo says. What she means is that when you have a sense of taste divorced from the trend of the hour, you will be less tempted to buy a $20 polyester ruched milkmaid dress from Shein the next time cottagecore fashion blows up on TikTok, wear it once, and then throw it out.\n\nBody-positive stylist Dacy Gillespie, who runs the popular fashion substack Unflattering, theorizes that the movement toward body positivity itself has played a role in the social shift that has people reexamining what they want from their clothes. If we’re able to put on our clothes without demanding they make us look as thin as possible, Gillespie argues, many new possibilities open up before us.\n\n“I see that a lot of people are thinking more about self-expression versus what’s ‘flattering’ or what we should wear,” Beltempo says. “Both worlds do still exist, but there’s definitely been a shift.”\n\nOr maybe there’s a more pragmatic explanation for the big shift in how we talk about clothes: the rise of stretchy fabrics like Lycra and Spandex.\n\n“It’s almost as dramatic as when they got rid of corsets.” — David Kibbe, personal stylist behind Kibbe image identities\n\n“In the old days, the silhouette was structured outside the body,” says David Kibbe, the personal stylist behind the hugely internet-famous phenomenon of Kibbe image identities. “A silhouette usually came from Paris, and it would change about once a decade” — hence the iconic ’40s shoulder pads and ’50s nipped-in waists.\n\nThen came the ’80s, when new technology began to make it possible for fabric to stretch around the natural form of the body, rather than build new shapes on top of it. Today, nearly all clothes are made from lightweight and stretchy fabric, and the silhouette is no longer swapped out once a decade by Parisian designers. Instead, it’s the product of the way an individual piece of clothing drapes around an individual body. “That changes everything,” Kibbe says. “It’s almost as dramatic as when they got rid of corsets.”\n\nNow, says Tashjian, fashion designers who used to issue edicts on what people should wear are beginning to talk about their work as being in service to the creative vision of the consumer.\n\n“I was really shocked to hear designers backstage talking about, ‘It’s really not about what I’m creating. It’s about giving these things to women, and they can put them together in interesting ways,’” Tashjian says. “We’re used to thinking of designers as dictators.”\n\nChanges in fabric technology made it possible for consumers to think about clothes in new ways, focusing on their own desires instead of the choices of a designer. Social media made it possible to talk about those thoughts in large groups. A growing progressive ethos of environmentalism and body positivity made it ever-more attractive to cultivate your own style. Now, it’s all that seems to matter when it comes to clothes.\n\nThe warring philosophies of style\n\nWhen I first started paying attention to the idea of personal style, it was toward the end of the Covid lockdowns. I wasn’t entirely sure how I wanted to dress, but when I looked at my old closet full of prim business casual dresses I thought: “Not this.”\n\nI wanted to know what looked good on my body. I wanted to not care if I looked thin. I wanted to feel fresh and modern. I wanted to not get bogged down in trends. I wanted lots of clothes that were new and exciting. I wanted to not spend my money on fast fashion. I wanted to answer to no one, and I wanted someone to explain clearly to me how everyone was dressing these days so that I would know what the benchmark was.\n\nLike many people who like clothes, rules, and esoteric theory, I found what felt like a possible answer to my impossible problem with Kibbe styling, invented by Kibbe and immortalized by his first book Metamorphosis in 1987.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the Kibbe system has become the organizing principle for a thriving internet subculture with subreddits and Facebook groups and TikTok videos — to no one’s surprise as much as Kibbe himself, who says he found out about his fan base when one of his clients told him he should search his name on Facebook. Now, it’s popular enough that Kibbe has released an updated and revised take on his system, David Kibbe’s Power of Style.\n\nKibbe’s system has a quasi-mystical allure partially because it’s so befuddling to figure out; it’s a little like diving deep into astrology. It contains ten image archetypes, and you sort yourself into them based on the way fabric drapes around your body. If it falls in straight, vertical folds, you are Dramatic; if it skims over you in lush, round curves, you are Romantic; if you fall somewhere in between, there’s a different type out there for you. Each type, in turn, gets recommended a different style vibe based on Old Hollywood archetypes. Regal Dramatics are supposed to look best in structured tailoring, like Lauren Bacall, whereas dreamy Romantics are supposed to look best in soft-edged, flowing clothes, like Marilyn Monroe.\n\nKibbe also sorts his clients into color seasons to figure out which colors look best on them — warm vs. cool, soft vs. bright. By the time his process is finished, the theory goes, you know exactly what shapes and colors flatter you, and you can ignore everything that doesn’t. In a marketplace thrown into hyperdrive by fast fashion, that’s an attractive idea.\n\nRelated How Kibbe body types became an internet obsession\n\n“Personal style is hard to find,” says Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at the New York Times. “Being conscious of it opens up a whole bunch of questions that you then have to ask yourself about how you’re presenting yourself and why you’re presenting yourself that way and how you feel every morning. That takes time, and then you can start getting neurotic about whether you’re doing it wrong. So offering guidelines like seasons and shapes and all that is a way to kind of take some of the neurosis or the insecurity out of it.”\n\nI am naturally skeptical of body typing systems, but I liked that Kibbe doesn’t seem to particularly care about making anyone look skinny. He talks a lot about “honoring” the unique attributes of each type, about making broad shoulders look broader and tall frames look taller.\n\nKibbe’s system has a quasi-mystical allure partially because it’s so befuddling to figure out; it’s a little like diving deep into astrology.\n\nAfter I found out about the system, I spent months squinting neurotically at people’s shoulders, trying to teach myself to see the attribute Kibbe describes as “width.” Eventually, after looking back and forth enough times between my own shoulders and Carole Lombard’s, I determined that I was a Soft Natural, the same group in which Kibbe has hilariously placed such disparate figures as Jennifer Lopez, Helen Mirren, and Kamala Harris.\n\nFinding my Kibbe type was a profoundly gratifying exercise, not least because a lot of the clothes he recommended for Soft Naturals were trending at the time. If my bias-cut slip dresses and slouchy cropped cardigans were sending a message, the message said that I was young, lived in a city, and knew what looked good on me.\n\nYet at the same time, I felt ambivalent about the idea of fixating on specific parts of my body, even if it was just to figure out the best ways to show them off, and on the idea of making my clothes “flattering,” which after all is still most often code for making yourself look as skinny as possible. There probably existed, I felt, some way of engaging with style that was more intellectual, purely about what you are drawn to aesthetically — so the real deprogramming could begin. The body positive and body neutral parts of the internet seemed like a good place to start.\n\n“When I work with clients, we spend one entire hour just talking about their relationship to clothes over the course of their lives, starting with when they were young and when they got messages about what they should wear,” says Gillespie, the body positive stylist. “It’s often body related.” You could make a whole career out of teaching people to drop all the racist, misogynistic baggage we’re all carrying around with our clothes.\n\nEven people in supposedly “ideal” bodies will probably remember being told that there were certain clothes that wouldn’t work on them. But our culture has a particularly specific slew of rules for fat people: telling them not to wear horizontal stripes that could make them look wider, or bright colors that make them stand out, or tight clothes that cling to their flesh. One of Gillespie’s goals is to help her clients learn to tune that advice out, and then figure out how to make their aesthetic dreams practical, to “translate it into something that works for them in the society that we live in.”\n\nGillespie points me to the example of the conventional advice for a pear-shaped person — wear fitted clothes on top that cinch the waist, and something looser and flowier on the bottom. “If you just think of that silhouette in your mind, that’s such a girly feminine silhouette. What if that’s not your vibe?” Gillespie asks. “What if you love an oversized androgynous look or something? To me that’s a really good explanation of how dressing to flatter your body could completely derail you from listening to what you actually want to wear.”\n\nIt’s for this reason that Gillespie is inherently suspicious of stylists like Kibbe. Kibbe, meanwhile, sees no point in counting the shape of your body out of the equation when you’re getting dressed, any more than he would count out the weight of the fabric.\n\n“Everything comes down to self love and ultimately self acceptance,” Kibbe told me. “I absolutely think you should love what you wear. That’s really important.” Still, he adds, if you want to make that androgynous silhouette that you love work on your body, you have to understand the rules of how fabric interacts with your actual, physical shape. Effect relies on technique, and without it, “then that fantasy stays in your head. So I believe in integration, the inner and the outer.”\n\nThere’s a third school of thought here, however, that doesn’t just think about style as a form of art and expression, but as a form of cultural communication. Clothes come with context, and we rely on them to tell strangers things about us.\n\nDerek Guy, a menswear blogger and social media power user, argues that having good style means understanding the cultural rules of clothing as though it is a grammar. For Guy, using systems like Kibbe’s to guide your dress choices can mean making nonsense out of your clothes’ cultural grammar, especially in the rigidly codified world of menswear. (“I don’t know anything about womenswear,” he says as a caveat.)\n\nTake, for instance, the practice of men wearing gray or navy suits to the office if they work in traditional fields like law and finance. “That’s because of the legacy of British cultural practices: gray and navy were worn in the office in London to do business, and brown and olive were worn in the country for sport,” Guy says.\n\nThis practice clashes with the seasonal color system Kibbe and other color analysts use, under which gray and navy are cool-toned colors that only people with cool-toned skin should wear. I myself am a warm autumn, which means I would need to seek out olive or brown businesswear — which, according to Guy, may not “convey the seriousness of business.” (Truly news we can use in digital media, where people regularly take meetings in their sweatpants.)\n\n“To me, all these ideas of dressing for your skin tone and body type are essentially trying to make what is cultural language seem like some type of pseudo-scientific endeavor, when it’s really culture that drives how we dress,” Guy says.\n\nSkinny jeans and the trend paradox\n\nEven after all that deep diving into style systems, even being careful to ignore the microtrends and TikTok core of the week, I couldn’t get away from the sense that every time I got dressed, I was still being pushed and buffeted by something outside of myself. I found a pair of skinny jeans from 2016 in the back of a drawer and could not stop staring at them, at how wrong they looked to me, how fundamentally incorrect. I could not believe I had ever worn anything so tight, so constricting around the ankles.\n\nYet I had worn such jeans on an almost daily basis for almost a decade and thought nothing of it. Why did they look so wrong now? Had I gotten so in touch with my own aesthetic preferences that I now realized I had never really liked them? Did they clash with the lines of my Soft Natural body? Were they speaking a cultural language I wasn’t interested in? Or was it simply that even after all that work, my sense of style was still under the control of the great cultural tide of trends?\n\nGuy’s take is that if you understand the cultural language of your pants, you can still pull off skinny jeans just fine. He points to the model and stylist Wisdom Kaye, who has been posting videos of himself rocking the now-reviled skinny jean to social media.\n\n“If you look at the outfits that he’s creating, what do they all rely on in terms of social language? Well, they all are relying on this rock’n’roll aesthetic,” Guy says. “So if your aesthetic inspiration is 1970s and ’80s rock ’n’ roll guys, you’re obviously not going to wear really wide leg pants, because that’s not the look. You’re going to wear skinny jeans. Side zip boots, flannels, black leather jackets. … That’s the look that was created through social history and will continue to be cool, because that’s the look of the Ramones, of Sid Vicious. The way that it goes bad is when guys start to wear skinny chinos with an office shirt.”\n\nIn contrast, Kibbe argues for paying attention to trends to a certain extent, and then interpreting them in a way that works for your image identity. “There should never be a subservience of style to trend or to fashion,” he says. “You should use those things in service of your star.” Then he added in slightly enigmatic tones, “A rosebud is very beautiful, but it is most beautiful of all when it’s in bloom.”\n\nGillespie, meanwhile, suggests looking at the problem of skinny jeans through the practical lens of your own life. “I will always try and encourage people to think about, if you’re feeling pressured to give your skinny jeans up: Why do you like them?” she says. “Do they serve a special function for you? For whatever reason, do you like having fabric close to your legs? Do you bike to work? Then I want you to consider all those things, and then reject the idea that says that skinny jeans look wrong, because you’re making that decision for yourself.”\n\nOn the other hand, is there anything more banal than not feeling like an individual in 2025? The vloggers and Substackers who talk about personal style all the time are full of this complaint. “It’s like it should be in a science fiction novel,” says Tashjian of the plethora of essays on this subject. “How is it that I’m reading over and over again, in some instances word for word, ‘It’s so hard to be an individual these days.’ And then you scroll a little bit: ‘It’s getting increasingly difficult to be an individual these days.’”\n\nTo be completely yourself: That is the fantasy of finding your style. To exist within the whole bizarre structure of fashion — all those billionaires deciding what you should wear, all those marketers deciding how you should feel about your one human body, all those materials that will lie next to your skin for some days and then rot forever in a landfill, all those people who will see you every day and make their assumptions about you based on how you look — and to feel that you’ve got some agency while you’re in there.\n\nBut the endless grind of capitalism has a way of turning all criticisms about our overconsumption into a new way of selling you things. If one of the weaknesses of our current fashion marketplace is that it’s hawking you trendy plastic clothes you would not otherwise want and will soon have to discard, and the way out is to get in touch with your own aesthetic desires — well, there are ways to monetize that journey, too.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior politics reporter at Vox, where he covers the Democratic Party. He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic’s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nParticipants cheer as Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during the “Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here” rally at Civic Center Park in Denver, Colorado on March 21, 2025. Jason Connolly / AFP via Getty Images\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz summed up the state of his party well recently, “The Democratic Party is unified — they’re unified in being pissed off at the Democrats.”\n\nJust 44 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the job Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is doing. About 54 percent are satisfied with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. And the party’s overall favorability is tanking.\n\nThat rage isn’t going away any time soon. The base looked ready to riot in March after Senate Democrats, led by Schumer, prevented a government shutdown by voting with Republicans to pass a stopgap funding bill. Many in the base saw the showdown as a red line — a wasted opportunity for their congressional representatives to obstruct Republicans and Trump, showing their constituents that they would finally fight back.\n\nThe last time a party base was this mad at its leadership, it was 2009, and movement Republicans were furious at party leaders for losing to former President Barack Obama, bailing out Wall Street, and failing to stop the Affordable Care Act. And what started out as base rage grew into a full-on interparty revolution — the Tea Party reorganized the Republican Party on its own terms.\n\nBut are Democrats about to face their own Tea Party moment? Is the rage that the base is feeling right now going to lead the party down the same path that Republicans went on during the Obama era?\n\nWhat the Tea Party rise looked like\n\nWhile early Tea Party activists and leaders argue that they had a sharply defined set of primarily libertarian, conservative beliefs about the role and size of government, their defining characteristic was anger: at the Obama administration, and the Republican Party’s inability to stop Democrats, and at Obama, personally.\n\nTheir original unifying theme was an acronym — “Taxed Enough Already,” a conservative call for less government spending, lower taxation, and strict interpretations of the Constitution. It was a loose network of local activists and groups who showed up to town halls, held protests locally and in DC, and eventually saw upstart individual candidates challenge moderate and establishment Republicans in both safe seats and swing seats.\n\nThey saw two discernible spikes in power and momentum: first in the lead-up to the 2010 midterm elections, when anti-incumbent dissatisfaction boosted congressional Republicans to win 63 House seats and make gains in the Senate. The second was in the 2014 midterms, when Republicans gained even more seats in the House and won back the Senate. In that time, the Tea Party went from GOP fringe to a rival power center that continually vexed its more establishment leadership. The movement was both ideological — as detailed above — and tactical. Tea Party candidates wanted Republicans to take extreme measures to obstruct Obama’s agenda, and they launched primary challenges to a slew of incumbent Republicans who refused to go along.\n\nNotably, the movement was defined by how decentralized it was at its start — though some national organizations later formed to try to organize and wield populist furor, it was mostly a grassroots movement. That energy sustained itself over more than five years and was strong enough to oust one of the Republican Party’s top leaders in 2014, when college professor Dave Brat beat GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The race was an upset, and is still largely considered the most emblematic Tea Party victory of the period.\n\n“The populist energy we had back then had a very clear logic to it. It was Madisonian, Adam Smith, decentralization, federalism, taxed enough already, and border security,” Brat told me recently. “When I ran, I was kind of a pre-Trump in a way, right? I ran on those things, and it’s all out there on paper. It was a content-driven race. It wasn’t like I was out for power.”\n\nThrough it all, there was at least some common thread holding the movement together: populist anger.\n\nHow the Tea Party movement mirrors today’s Democrats\n\nWhat makes 2025 feel like 2009 and 2014 is the level of intra-party anger and the unifying of the party around a shorthand slogan: “Do Something.”\n\nThe polling data, for example, does reveal some parallels between 2009, 2014, and today. Self-identified Democrats now view their party about as negatively as Republicans did from 2009 to 2015, the years of the Tea Party’s dominance, according to polling analysis by the election data site Split Ticket. As that site’s co-founder Lakshya Jain said in a recent post, “the Democratic approval data is unlike any in recent history — and it isn’t a case of bitter, disaffected partisans reacting to a loss in the last election.”\n\nJain notes that this year is different from the last two times Democrat and Republican bases had to reckon with presidential losses. In 2017, for example, Democrats didn’t turn away from their leaders: approval ratings of congressional Democrats rose from 2017 to 2019, as the base approved of their party’s resistance to Trump and empowered a blue wave in the midterms. In 2021, meanwhile, the Republican base remained largely favorable toward congressional Republicans after Trump’s loss. The numbers suggest this year might be the start of something different from Democrats.\n\nThat anger is showing up online, in the press, and in-person in places like deep-blue California, Massachusetts, and Maryland, where pissed-off constituents are squaring off with elected Democrats — venting to their representatives about how frustrated they are by their leadership’s weak resistance to Trump and Musk. That mirrors some of the town halls and rallies that defined the populist Tea Party insurgency in 2009 and 2010, and which carried over into the second Obama term.\n\nAngry Democrats have and are continuing to mobilize. Anti-establishment figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been speaking to this frustration during rallies in five states this month. The party’s establishment stand-in, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, meanwhile was confronted for his decision to stop a shutdown in interviews and eventually canceled a book tour over concern about how Democratic audiences would react.\n\nOther Democratic politicians have begun to turn their ire on fellow Democrats in Congress. Walz, on his own town hall tour, is sharply criticizing the current congressional Democratic strategy of essentially letting Trump and Republicans damage themselves and get more unpopular.\n\nWhat makes this moment different from the Tea Party\n\nStill, 2025 is a very different moment of rage. Today’s Democratic base anger isn’t primarily ideological — there’s no policy, agenda, candidate, or unifying principle that is rallying Democrats against their party leaders like it did for conservative Republicans. The closest is anger at Schumer, specifically. And while anti-establishment, anti-incumbent feeling does define this discontent, it’s mostly around the loose idea of resisting harder, of fighting back against Trump and “doing something.”\n\nFor example, another recent Data for Progress polling reveals two particular kinds of anger. The first is aimed at Schumer specifically for being an ineffective leader for Senate Democrats. An outright majority of Democrats think Senate Democrats to choose a new leader. And two-thirds say they should be led by someone “who fights harder against Trump and the Republican agenda.”\n\nThe second point of anger is age and gerontocracy. Nearly 70 percent of Democrats think the party should “encourage elderly leaders to retire and pass the torch to the younger generation.” And more than 80 percent think it is “very” or “somewhat” important for Democrats to field “younger candidates that represent a new generation of leadership.”\n\nSo while there’s no uniformity right now in who the Democrats’ lead internal critics are — between Sanders, Walz, AOC, and others, no clear ideological or demographic trait binds them — what does is their call for a kind of generational change. This doesn’t necessarily mirror the GOP Tea Party period’s start, and if anything, is more reminiscent of the 2018 blue-wave energy — which also didn’t necessarily elect a more moderate or progressive Democratic bench.\n\nWhat 2018 did result in was a much more diverse and female Congress, and a version of that kind of change could replicate itself next year if younger candidates end up trying to challenge older incumbents for not being more vocal and effective in their resistance to Trump.\n\nThe generational revolution ahead\n\nAt least at the state and local level, this kind of younger energy is emerging. Amanda Litman, the co-founder of the progressive Run for Something candidate recruitment group, told me that since the shutdown quandary, younger people have been the leading kind of prospective candidate looking to run.\n\n“The people who have reached out to me personally about running for Congress, and I hear from in particular young people who know that we work with young people and first-time candidates … it has been people who want to primary older Democratic incumbents. There’s people who want to jump into possibly open races, people who want to run against vulnerable Republicans, it is all of the above.”\n\nLitman told me that the Tea Party comparison, while easy to make, might be missing that the party could be in for a generational turnover, as opposed to some kind of ideological or policy change — candidates running with the knowledge that “the Republican Party of the early 2000s through 2015 is dead” and “came of age politically since Trump rose to power.”\n\n“You’re going to see a totally different type of person running as a Democrat,” Litman said.\n\n“You’re going to see people who have made their careers as content creators or influencers running for Congress, non-conventional candidates jumping in, and we’re going to see a generational push,” she said. “[It will include] people who’ve actually run their own Instagram accounts, which is such a small thing, but it’s actually indicative of the entire generational shift in power.”",

There are some who seem to have the innate ability to keep their spices alphabetized, their clothes separated by color and season, and power cords neatly wound all in one place. Then there are others with more junk drawers than regular ones and small collections of stuff that have accumulated over time.\n\nIf you’re a member of the latter group, you may have been one of the many curious minds scouring Google for decluttering tips — the search term hit a five-year high in 2025 — or found yourself in a hypnotic home organizing TikTok wormhole.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

In her experience, the greatest decluttering hurdle is finding the will to get started. Some clients have the perception that the task will be too difficult, the project too big. Maybe you’re in the same boat. Or perhaps the online content you’ve seen around home organization — rife with expensive bins and colorful labels — has you feeling pressured to drop hundreds of dollars on products. However, the secret to decluttering, experts say, is to rely on function over aesthetics and to organize like a real person and not an influencer.\n\nStart with a small, manageable task\n\nFor those who struggle getting started, take some pressure off: You don’t need to organize your entire house in one weekend. But you should begin with a smaller task or area, ideally one that causes you the most aggravation. Are you constantly tripping over shoes and bookbags as soon as you walk in the door? Start with your entranceway. Does your laundry pile up on an office chair that you’d really like to sit in again? Tackle that first. Do you struggle to find a spot for groceries in the fridge? Make that your project for the day.\n\n“Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall.”\n\nIf even those assignments seem too big, Wiss suggests breaking them down into micro-tasks: clearing out just the vegetable drawer or storing winter coats. Keep these smaller projects relegated to one room and commit to slowly making progress over time, says professional organizer Robyn Reynolds, the CEO of Southern California-based company Organize2Harmonize. “If you do a corner here in this room and a corner there in the other room, you’re not really going to see the progress and then you’re going to feel defeated,” she says. “But if you actually are able to finish an entire room, then you’re going to feel really motivated and proud of yourself because you actually did it.”\n\nYou might let that momentum carry you onto another small to-do list item. But be mindful of your energy levels. You don’t want to empty your pantry and lack the motivation to put everything back. “Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall and then you still need for those piles to go somewhere.”\n\nTry the three-second rule for purging\n\nWiss has a straightforward three-step approach to decluttering: Sort like with like, purge, then containerize. First, make sure everything you want to organize is in one place. For instance, all of your chargers should live in one area, all of your shoes should be stored in the same place, all your bowls and plates should be in the kitchen. Then, you can see how many chargers or sneakers or bowls you have and pare down where needed.\n\nIf you’re finding it hard to part with impractical but sentimental items… Remind yourself that you’re not discarding the memory of a loved one, just their possessions. If the item is not your style and you’ll never use it, let it go. Don’t hold onto items that will only get damaged over years in storage. “So many times when I clear out garages with clients,” Reynolds says, “so many things we find [have] mold or water damage. So what was the point of holding on to it when it just got destroyed and now they’re throwing it out anyway?”\n\nThe purge stage can often be challenging because many people attach memories and sentiments to objects and find it difficult to part with them. Kayleen Kelly, a professional organizer in Olympia, Washington, developed a three-second rule to help her clients pare down items. After you’ve collected and sorted all of one category of item — like coffee mugs — go through one by one and decide which item you’ll keep. If you hesitate for more than three seconds when weighing whether or not to keep a specific mug, it’s an automatic keep. This technique ensures you’re making confident decisions about what to get rid of. “If you can’t decide,” Kelly says, “and you hesitate, there’s no punishment for indecision. So you just keep it and you keep moving forward.”\n\nTo further aid your decision-making process, ask yourself if the item is actually useful, Reynolds says. Again, not everything needs to be utilitarian, but it isn’t worth keeping posters from college you never plan on hanging up again. But if you do manage to get infrequent but meaningful use out of that family heirloom fondue pot, by all means, keep it. Reynolds also recommends taking photos of sentimental but impractical items and collecting them in a photo book or digital slideshow. That way, you can memorialize grandma’s couch without needing to sacrifice space for it in your basement.\n\nOnce you’ve pared down items, you can properly organize them. This is where you’ll create a system for your closet, garage, pantry, or other area you’re decluttering. It can be as simple as dedicating one shelf in the linen closet to sheets and another for towels.\n\nDon’t spend money on organizers when an old shoebox will do\n\nExperts have observed clients’ all-too-common urge to buy expensive organizers and bins before they even start discarding items. Online, influencers push aesthetically pleasing storage containers and label makers, only adding to the pressure that true decluttering involves spending money. “It’s not about buying more products,” Kelly says. The reality is, once you pare down your makeup brushes, you may realize you don’t need a container, and a cup from the kitchen will do.\n\nThe most important aspect of organizing, Kelly says, is for your system of choice to be functional, so don’t waste money on eight-tier hangers if you know you lack the patience to put eight shirts on them. If you do need a container, try to reuse what you already have at home, like a shoebox, Tupperware, an old iPhone box, or a piece of cardboard from an Amazon box as a drawer organizer. For everything else, your local dollar store will have inexpensive organizers and bins.\n\nDonate what you don’t need\n\nThe most integral aspect of decluttering is to remove the clutter from your space. Don’t get hung up on the logistics until after you’ve set aside the items you want to get rid of, Kelly says. In her experience, most of her clients’ discarded items are in good enough condition to be donated. “Find a place in your local area that takes the majority of everything,” she says. That might be your local Goodwill, Salvation Army, thrift store, or women’s shelter.\n\nRelated Buy less stuff\n\nAfter organizing smaller spaces, like your linen closet or the cabinet under the sink, you may have a more limited collection of items to donate. You can be more targeted with these donations, Kelly says, since you have less to discard — and fewer decisions to make.\n\nLocal Buy Nothing Facebook groups are also effective in finding your stuff a new home.\n\nFor items that can’t be donated or given away, look up your city or town’s recycling rules. If all else fails, throw items in the trash.\n\nMake it a habit\n\nBecause life inevitably happens, systems may fall into disarray and products may once again accumulate. Decluttering should be an ongoing process throughout the year.\n\nTo keep her clients in a clutter-free state of mind, Reynolds often imparts some words of wisdom. “Everything has a price: time, space, money, or energy,” she says. Consider what your clutter is costing you in terms of the time that could be better spent doing anything other than decluttering, the space your items take up, the money it costs to keep, and the vibe it brings to your home.",

        "content": "is a news editor with Vox’s politics and policy team. He’s helped cover elections, Congress, and both the Biden and Trump administrations. Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nAs the name of the Catholic Charities case suggests, this case involves a Catholic organization that seeks a religious exemption from a state law — in this case, Wisconsin’s law requiring most employers to pay taxes that fund unemployment benefits for their workers.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAll six of the Court’s Republicans, plus Democratic Justice Elena Kaga,n seemed to favor that outcome, and the Court’s decision could potentially be unanimous.\n\nThat said, several of the justices, including Republicans Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, did express concerns that there must be some limit on a business’s ability to exempt itself from the law if it claims that its operations are motivated by religion. Roberts, for example, asked whether a group of people who think it is a sin to eat meat could exempt themselves from taxes if they opened a vegetarian restaurant.\n\nSimilarly, Barrett noted at one point that there is a difference between a nonprofit charity and a for-profit business, suggesting that she may limit the scope of some religious exemptions to nonprofits.\n\nThe question of whether this Court will set some limit on when religiously motivated organizations can claim an exemption from the law is probably more important than the specific dispute before the justices in Catholic Charities. The Catholic Church claims that it maintains its own internal unemployment benefits system that “provides the same maximum weekly benefit rate as the State’s system.” So it appears that, regardless of who prevails before the Supreme Court, Catholic Charities’ workers will still receive similar benefits.\n\nBut the Court’s decision is unlikely to be limited to the Catholic Church, meaning that workers at religious organizations that do not offer unemployment insurance could lose that benefit altogether. And, if the Court’s decision is too broad, it could potentially allow for-profit businesses to thumb their nose at workplace regulations of all kinds, simply by claiming that they object to those regulations on religious grounds.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Roberts, Barrett, or some other justice will slip language into the Court’s decision that will prevent for-profit companies from dodging unemployment laws, minimum wage laws, workplace safety laws, and similar regulations. If they do not, the Court’s decision in Catholic Charities could have dire consequences for many American workers.\n\nWhat’s the specific legal dispute in Catholic Charities?\n\nWisconsin, like every other state, taxes employers to fund benefits for workers who lose their jobs. Like most states, Wisconsin’s law includes an exemption for church-run nonprofits that are “operated primarily for religious purposes.” According to the state’s highest court, this exemption only applies to nonprofits that primarily engage in religious activities such as holding worship services, and not to charities that provide secular services like feeding poor people or caring for people with disabilities — even if these secular services are motivated by the charity’s faith.\n\nCatholic Charities, meanwhile, provides these kinds of secular services and does not proselytize its faith to the people it serves. Significantly, the Catholic Church chooses to operate Catholic Charities as a separate corporation that is distinct from the greater church itself, even though the charitable arm is controlled by church officials.\n\nThis decision to separately incorporate Catholic Charities provides considerable benefits to the greater church. Most notably, it means that, if Catholic Charities is successfully sued, that lawsuit cannot touch the broader church’s assets. But the church’s decision to make Catholic Charities a separate corporate entity means that this entity is not exempt from the state’s unemployment law — because Catholic Charities itself only provides secular services.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nCatholic Charities claims that this arrangement is unconstitutional, and that it should be allowed to benefit both from separate incorporation and from the state’s exemption for organizations “operated primarily for religious purposes.”\n\nThough its lawyers offered three different reasons to rule in their favor, several of the justices suggested that the simplest and most straightforward way to rule in the church’s favor would be to conclude that Wisconsin unconstitutionally discriminates against religious sects that engage in charitable work without proselytizing or otherwise engaging in the kind of religious activity that triggers Wisconsin’s exemption.\n\nIndeed, many of the justices pounced on a disastrous concession by Colin Roth, the lawyer defending Wisconsin’s regime before the Court. Justice Samuel Alito asked Roth what is the bare minimum Catholic Charities would need to do in order to secure an exemption, and Roth said that a charity which runs a soup kitchen would be exempt if it requires hungry people to say the Lord’s Prayer before they receive soup, but not if it runs an identical soup kitchen without this requirement.\n\nBut such a distinction, Kagan warned, discriminates against the Catholic Church specifically because its religious beliefs require it to do charitable works without demanding that the beneficiaries of those works participate in Catholicism. “I thought it was pretty fundamental that we don’t treat some religions better than other religions,” Kagan said.\n\nWithout the Obama-appointed Kagan’s vote, it’s hard to imagine how Wisconsin can win this case. And all six of the Court’s Republicans appeared to share Kagan’s concern.\n\nWhat will happen when the next case involves a more exploitative employer?\n\nThe Court’s 40-year-old decision in Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor (1985) looms large over Catholic Charities. In that case, a religious organization that was widely described as a cult owned numerous for-profit businesses, including “service stations, retail clothing and grocery outlets, hog farms, roofing and electrical construction companies, a recordkeeping company, a motel, and companies engaged in the production and distribution of candy.” Workers in these businesses were given no wages or cash salaries, only food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nAfter the federal government sued, claiming violations of minimum wage and overtime laws, the Court rejected the organization’s request for a religious exemption from these laws. Among other things, the Court warned that if a religious cult is allowed to pay substandard (or nonexistent) wages, that “would undoubtedly give [it] and similar organizations an advantage over their competitors” — and push employers who must comply with federal law out of the market.\n\nAgain, the immediate consequences of a decision ruling in favor of Catholic Charities is likely to be minimal, because the Catholic Church has its own unemployment benefits program. But if Catholic Charities is entitled to a religious exemption for the reason offered by Kagan, then it is unclear why some other religious organizations cannot claim an exemption even if it does not provide unemployment benefits.\n\nSimilarly, if it is unconstitutional for a state to treat religions that do not proselytize differently than religions that do, why can the state discriminate against religions that operate for-profit businesses? As Justice Barrett noted at one point, a church may very well believe that raising money to fund its operations is as essential to its religious mission as the Catholic Church believes that charitable work is to its mission.\n\nOne possibility is that the Court could create a carve-out specifically for for-profit entities — ruling that they cannot seek religious exemptions from the law. This is the rule the Court laid out in United States v. Lee (1982), which held that “when followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.”\n\nBut the Court also seemed to walk away from Lee in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), which held that for-profit corporations may seek religious exemptions from federal (although not necessarily state) law.\n\nAfter Monday’s oral argument, it seems inevitable that the Court will rule that the Catholic Church can enjoy all the benefits of separately incorporating Catholic Charities, without the costs that normally come along with that decision. If that’s all the Court rules, then it is hardly the end of the world for American workers.",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox writing about climate change, energy policy, and science. He is also a regular contributor to the radio program Science Friday. Prior to Vox, he was a reporter for ClimateWire at E&E News.\n\nThe warming spring air is a welcome relief from the bitterly cold winter across much of the US, but millions of seasonal allergy sufferers are getting buried under a pollen tsunami, with sneezing, headaches, watery eyes, and stuffed sinuses sending them right back indoors.\n\nAlready, Atlanta has broken its pollen count record, with 14,801 grains per cubic meter spewing from pine, oak, and birch trees. Houston also reported its highest pollen counts since 2013, when records began.\n\nRelated Get ahead of allergy season this year\n\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) projects that 2025 will be yet another brutal year for seasonal allergies across the country, with the worst-afflicted cities in the southern US. Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you — seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly one in three US adults and one in four children.\n\nWhy? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the sirens of climate change. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said Kenneth Mendez, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants.\n\n“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said.\n\nFor most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling blergh at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis — the condition you probably know of as hay fever — and related allergy conditions cost the economy billions of dollars each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits.\n\nThere are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to 25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.\n\nOver time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in.\n\n“If the trendlines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.\n\nHow we keep making allergies worse for ourselves\n\nThe problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like asthma attacks, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they can lead to anaphylaxis, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels.\n\nThe vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur.\n\nSome people are more sensitive than others, but the relentless, growing exposure can add up to misery even for those with mild allergies. Pollen grains range in size from 100 down to less than 10 microns, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate airways. Many types of plants release pollen as part of their reproductive cycle. Generally, trees spread pollen in the spring, grasses over the summer, and ragweed in the autumn.\n\nAirborne cloud of pine pollen from male pine cones in Arizona. Wild Horizons/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHowever, the historical pollen timing patterns have already shifted.\n\nTree pollen is wafting off of branches earlier in the season almost every year. Some grass species have seen their pollen release days delayed by almost a month while their overall season has grown longer. As a result, grass pollen increasingly overlaps with the ragweed pollen season, which itself has been extended by more than three weeks in some parts of the country since 1995.\n\nThere are two key mechanisms driving this trend, both induced by humanity’s appetite for fossil fuels. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil, and natural gas directly induce many plant species to produce more pollen. Carbon dioxide can make plants grow bigger and faster, and produce more flowers, which leads to more pollen. More pollen leads to more seeds, which means even more plants spraying pollen the next season.\n\nHigher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also warming the planet and changing the climate. In general, that means warmer, shorter winters and earlier springs, which leads to longer growing seasons for plants. These trends will continue as global average temperatures go up, making allergies a significant public health burden.\n\nSome parts of the country, such as Texas, are on track to see pollen counts almost double by 2050 compared to 2000.\n\nIt’s not just pollen you have to worry about\n\nFor many people, allergies are an added complication on top of other health and environmental conditions. Air pollution from ozone, particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds can cause their own breathing problems, but when they intersect with allergies, they can make symptoms even worse. Pollution from roads can make pollen from nearby plants more potent at triggering allergic reactions. Smoke from wildfires can also exacerbate allergies.\n\nCities may not offer much refuge. Changes to the landscape like urbanization can create a more favorable habitat for plants like ragweed. City centers also tend to warm up faster than their rural surroundings and experience higher concentrations of air pollutants, compounding the effects of allergies. These factors are especially potent in low-income and underserved communities.\n\nPollen isn’t the only allergen changing with the climate either. Rising temperatures and precipitation in some areas are increasing the number and duration of allergenic mold spores. Extreme weather further worsens the problem, as the damage and destruction create conditions for more mold. That was evident in New Orleans last year as storms like Hurricane Francine soaked the city.\n\n“When these storms come through, they create so much damage over the landscape of the state. Some communities have resources to immediately move in and repair roofs and patch windows, and then we have a lot of folks that simply don’t have those resources. With leaking roofs, you have mold growth indoors,” said John Carlson, who leads the high-risk allergy division at the Ochsner health system in New Orleans. “Because it’s so warm here, we can grow mold year round as long as there’s moisture.”\n\nHigh winds from storms can also whip up dust, which can then trigger asthma. Additionally, there’s a phenomenon called thunderstorm asthma, where the weather conditions can rupture pollen grains into smaller, more allergenic fragments, triggering asthma attacks.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the overall number of people with seasonal allergies is increasing. The US may be approaching a plateau in the number of people who are susceptible to pollen, Carlson said. At the same time, there are other conditions that can present with allergy-like symptoms, and at high enough concentrations, even people without allergies will wheeze.\n\n“In New Orleans, we have a ton of oak pollen — I mean, just so much oak pollen in the air — and you commonly have a lot of people who don’t have oak pollen allergy nevertheless with itchy eyes and the sneezing from just the irritant effect of the particles,” Carlson said.\n\nThe good news is that there are ways to contain the worst effects of seasonal allergies. For people with a history of bothersome seasonal allergies, seeing an allergist and finding out what their specific triggers are and what medicines work is key. It may make sense to start taking medications like nose sprays or over-the-counter allergy drugs before pollen ramps up.\n\nRelated 4 tips for dealing with a ferocious allergy season\n\n“We generally say to have your medications in your system close to two weeks ahead of time because it takes some time to build up,” Mendez said. For people who don’t know if they have allergies but are concerned about the threat, pay attention to your symptoms and see an allergist if you do start to experience irritated eyes and airways. There are also more aggressive interventions for people with severe allergies who don’t respond to other medicines like desensitization therapy, also known as allergy shots.\n\nSome of the same measures for avoiding air pollution also work for pollen. Pay attention to pollen forecasts in your local area. Avoid being outside and close doors and windows during high pollen release times, particularly in the morning. Leave your coat and shoes outside or locked away before you settle down at home. Wipe down your dog after a walk. Use a HEPA air filter in your living spaces.",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

She joined Vox in 2022 as a senior producer and then as host of The Weeds, Vox’s policy podcast.\n\nIf you’ve read the news lately, you’ve probably heard that Americans may be in the middle of a sex recession. But at least one demographic of people are having the best sex of their lives: Gen X women. At least that’s the argument writer Mireille Silcoff makes in her most recent piece in the New York Times magazine.\n\nIn it, she explores her own middle-aged sexual awakening. “I was trying to explain a moment that I was really seeing everywhere,” she told Vox. Between her own life, her friends’ experiences, and the portrayals in pop culture that were popping up everywhere, she sensed a trend emerging. “There seems to be something new in the air having to do with 50-year-old women, their bodies, sex, and relationships.”\n\nSo what is in the air right now? And what’s behind these later-in-life sexual revelations? We talked to Silfcoff to find out exactly what’s going on here in this week’s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox’s weekly call-in show.

If you’d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\n\nWhat prompted you to write about this in the first place?\n\nI split up from my ex in my late 40s, after a very long relationship of 21 years. When I came out of it, I just thought that what lay ahead of me would be a pretty spinster-ish existence. I was really, really sick for a long time in my adulthood, and my marriage was very long and there were two children. I just felt like, “Well, who is going to want this bag of problems? Now I’m 50.” Life is going to be orange pekoe tea, Masterpiece Theater, taking care of my kids, and hopefully remobilizing my writing, and that’s it. And then instead what happened was I had a lot of wonderful new relationships with a lot of wonderful men and the kind of sex that I don’t think I had even had in my 20s: a total new world of openness, exploration, interest, comfort in myself, self-knowledge and even, I daresay, wisdom. It felt revelatory.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAnd at first, I felt like this was my weird, cool story. But then, as stuff started coming out of the culture, some of my other friends divorced and had similar situations to mine, I realized that what I had been doing or what I had experienced post-marriage was really part of a much larger cultural story that might ring true for many women in America and beyond today.\n\nWhat do you think the factors are in this mid-life sexual revitalization?\n\nThe women who are middle-aged now are — for the most part — Gen X. You’re starting to get some millennial middle-aged people as well. And Gen X women had a really interesting formative experience when it comes to sex in the ’90s. Divorce is also happening later than ever.\n\nDivorce and sexual exploration for women is a very old story: You get divorced and suddenly find a little piece of yourself sexually. I feel like that’s kind of a big part of the story as well. So women having a bit of this sexual rediscovery later and finding when they’re 47 or 55 that desire is still there, that sexual function is still there, that — thanks to the amazing strides that Gen Z and millennials have made opening up what’s acceptable sexually — acceptance is still there.\n\nRelated The online sex police are always watching and always so mad\n\nSo Gen X women are more comfortable in their bodies. They may be more into figuring out kinks and things like that. Why do you think this is happening with Gen X women in particular? Why is this generation so different from boomers?\n\nBoomers were constricted by a lot of societal norms that were, for lack of a better way of putting it, very mid-century. There was an open attitude toward sex, and free love was a boomer construct. But what happened with all of that stuff is that when all of those ideas really came to roost in the late ’80s and the early ’90s — when women were suddenly working but men were still the bosses — it created a tough situation for the people who inherited that very open sexual culture.\n\nI see Gen X as being a generation of women who really were plunked into an extremely sexualized landscape and were needing to fend for themselves. There wasn’t a lot of support for how to navigate bosses who were sexually predatory. There weren’t a lot of roadmaps for how to have sex or how to be a sexual person. That was both good and bad, because, for instance, many women didn’t experience orgasms because they just couldn’t figure out how and their male partners couldn’t figure out how so it just didn’t happen. I feel like that wouldn’t happen now. You’ve got things like OMG Yes, which is a website where you can find out how to have a female orgasm. It’s a much more open environment now in order to find out about sex. But at the same time among the younger generations, there is a bit of a cliff that’s happened with sexual frequency.\n\nI want to talk about that a little bit. There are so many conversations right now about how young people are having less and less sex. It seems like there’s a backlash to sex positivity. Do you think millennials and Gen Z women take these sexual freedoms for granted?\n\nYou do take it for granted, as you should. The parents create the situation, and the young people take it for granted.\n\nI think that the culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that you really see the sexual drop-off starting to happen in the same years that the iPhone was introduced. It’s in the same years that social media really got going.\n\n“The culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships.”\n\nPeople go out less, they hang out less. They do things together less in weird spaces where things can get weird. There was a lot more natural weirdness back in the day. And natural weirdness can lead to intimate moments, which can lead to sex. I just feel like there’s a certain cleanliness of experience in the culture right now where people are so afraid to intermingle in those old ways. It has had a big effect on people’s ability to hook up or have casual sex or go from one boyfriend to another to another until you find one that you like. In some ways, I think it’s wonderful for middle-aged people who already had that socialization.\n\nWhat do you hope for middle-aged women moving forward? Especially when it comes to sex, desire, and relationships?",

        "content": "is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change. Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.\n\nEach year, in late spring and early summer, female sea turtles will crawl out of the ocean under moonlight to lay their eggs in the sand, often returning to the same beach on which they were born many years earlier.\n\nSometimes when the turtles emerge to nest, researchers like Julianna Martin are watching patiently from the shadows.\n\nJulianna Martin collecting tears from a female sea turtle on a beach in Florida. Her research was carried out in accordance with UCF Marine Turtle Research Group permit MTP-171. Courtesy of Julianna Martin\n\nFor her doctoral research, Martin, a PhD student at the University of Central Florida, has been analyzing sea turtle tears. Yes, the tears of sea turtles. So on several summer nights in 2023 and 2024, she’d stake out beaches and wait for the turtles to start laying eggs. At that point, the reptiles enter a sort of “trance,” she said, allowing scientists like her to collect samples, including tears.\n\nMartin told me she would army crawl up to the turtles on the sand and dab around their eyes with a foam swab, soaking up the goopy tears they exude. Sea turtles regularly shed tears as a way to expel excess salt from their bodies. (As far as we know, they are not sad.)\n\nMartin would then take those tears back to her lab for analysis.\n\nThis odd work serves a purpose. Martin is examining sea turtle tears to see if they contain a specific kind of bacteria. Such a discovery, she said, could help unlock one of biology’s biggest and most awe-inspiring mysteries: how animals navigate using Earth’s invisible magnetic field.\n\nThe “holy grail” of sensory biology\n\nAfter baby turtles hatch, they dig their way out of the sand and crawl into the ocean, where they embark on an epic journey that can take them thousands of miles across the open sea. Loggerheads that hatch in Florida, for example, swim across the Atlantic and reach islands off the coast of Portugal, before eventually returning to Florida’s beaches as adults to nest.\n\nRemarkably, the turtles typically return to the same region of Florida or even to the same beach.\n\n“These young turtles can guide themselves along that 10,000-mile migratory path despite never having been in the ocean before and despite traveling on their own,” said Kenneth Lohmann, a biologist at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies sea turtle navigation.\n\nA green sea turtle with visible tears covered in sand nesting on a beach. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nResearchers like Lohmann have learned that sea turtles, like many other species, seem to navigate using Earth’s magnetic field. That’s the subtle magnetic force — generated by the planet’s molten metal core — that surrounds Earth, not unlike the force around a bar magnet. The intensity and direction of the field vary across Earth’s surface, making it useful for navigation. Plus, the magnetic field is present even when other spatial cues, like light, are not.\n\nWhat remains a mystery, however, is how animals sense these magnetic forces. Decades of research have failed to turn up a mechanism for so-called magnetoreception or any kind of specialized organ that can sense magnetic force. As Martin’s adviser Robert Fitak has written, it’s like knowing an animal can respond to something visual but not finding any eyes.\n\n“It’s the last sense we effectively know nothing about,” sensory biologist Eric Warrant has said about magnetoreception. “The solution of this problem I would say is the greatest holy grail in sensory biology.”\n\nScientists have proposed a number of theories for how this might work. And all of them are totally bonkers.\n\nThe prevailing theory is rooted in quantum mechanics, and it is extremely complicated. The theory posits that when certain light-sensitive molecules known as cryptochromes absorb light, they produce something called radical pairs — two separate molecules each with one unpaired electron. Those two unpaired electrons are quantumly entangled, which essentially means that their spin states are interdependent: They either point in the same direction or opposite directions, and they ping-pong between the two.\n\nThis theory suggests that Earth’s magnetic field influences the spin states of those radical pairs, and that, in turn, affects the outcome of chemical reactions in the body of animals. Those chemical reactions — which animals can theoretically interpret, as they might, for example, smells or visuals — encode information about Earth’s magnetic field. (If you want to dive deeper, I suggest watching this lecture or reading this paper.)\n\nAnother theory suggests that animals have bits of magnetic material in their bodies, such as the mineral magnetite. According to this theory, those magnetic bits are influenced by Earth’s magnetic field — just like a compass — and animals can sense those influences to figure out where they’re going.\n\nMartin and Fitak’s research is exploring this latter theory, but with an important twist. They suspect that sea turtles and other animals might rely on magnetite to sense Earth’s magnetic field but may not produce the magnetite themselves. Instead, they suggest, sea turtles may have a symbiotic relationship with magnetite-producing bacteria — literally living compasses — that sense the magnetic field and somehow communicate information back to the turtle.\n\nThis isn’t an outrageous idea. Magnetic bacteria — more technically, magnetotactic bacteria — is real, and quite common in aquatic environments around the world. Plus, there’s evidence that magnetotactic bacteria help another microscopic organism, known as a protist, navigate. The question is, could they help turtles navigate, too?\n\nMagnetic bacteria is a thing\n\nMagnetotactic bacteria are extremely cool. These microscopic organisms have what are essentially built-in compass needles, said Caroline Monteil, a microbial ecologist at the French research institute CEA. The needles comprise chains of magnetic particles produced by the microbes, which you can see under a microscope (shown in images below). Remarkably, those needles align the bacteria with Earth’s magnetic field lines, just like a real compass needle does. As the bacteria roam about, they move in line with the direction of the planet’s magnetic force.\n\nMagnetotactic bacteria under a microscope. The black arrows point to chains of structures that contain tiny magnetic particles. NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes\n\nMagnetic sensing is useful for the bacteria, said Fitak, an assistant professor at UCF. Magnetotactic bacteria need specific levels of oxygen to survive, and those levels tend to vary with depth. Deeper levels of sediment in a stream, for example, might have less oxygen. In most of the world, the direction of the magnetic field is at least somewhat perpendicular to Earth’s surface — meaning, up and down — allowing the bacteria to move vertically through their environment to find the optimal habitat, as if they’re on a fixed track.\n\nIn at least one case, magnetic bacteria team up with other organisms to help them find their way. A remarkable study published in 2019 found that microscopic organisms in the Mediterranean Sea called protists were able to sense magnetic forces because their bodies were covered in magnetic bacteria. When the authors put the north pole of a bar magnet next to a water droplet full of protists, they swam toward it. When they flipped the magnet, the protists swam away. (Different magnetic microbes are attracted to either north or south poles, often depending on where on Earth they live.)\n\nYou can actually see this in the video below.\n\nIt’s not clear how the magnetic bacteria are actually guiding the protist, said Monteil, the study’s lead author.\n\nNow, returning to the turtles: The theory that Fitak and Martin are exploring is that sea turtles, like protists, might also have magnetotactic bacteria — those living compasses — in their bodies, and somehow be able to read them. Some microbes in the microbiome aid in digestion. Others provide directions. Maybe.\n\nOne idea, Martin says, is that the bacteria could aggregate near nerves in the turtles that provide information about their position in space. Some of those nerves are near the tear ducts, she said — which is ultimately why she was army crawling on the beach to collect turtle tears. The goal, she said, is to figure out if those tears contain magnetotactic bacteria. That would be one indication that these animals might be using bacteria for navigation.\n\n“We’re not entirely sure how magnetotactic bacteria could be facilitating a magnetic sense, but that seemed like a good place to start,” Martin said.\n\nMartin swabs a green sea turtle on a boat in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon. Her research was carried out in accordance with UCF Marine Turtle Research Group permits MTP-231 and NMFS 26268. Courtesy of Julianna Martin\n\nWhile her research is still underway, Martin has yet to find evidence of magnetotactic bacteria in the tears of the 30 or so turtles she’s analyzed so far. That’s disappointing, she said, but it doesn’t rule out the possibility that these bacteria exist somewhere in the body of a turtle and help them navigate.\n\n“There are so many other ideas about ways that magnetotactic bacteria could provide information to an organism about Earth’s magnetic field,” she said. “There’s a variety of other locations and other taxa that might be better for studying this theory.”\n\nOther scientists who study animal navigation are skeptical.\n\nIt’s unlikely that symbiosis with magnetotactic bacteria is what enables sea turtle navigation, said Monteil. Part of the problem is that there’s no known mechanism through which the bacteria would communicate with the turtle. It’s also not clear what magnetotactic bacteria would get out of this relationship, if it is indeed symbiotic — could sea turtles provide the conditions bacteria need to survive? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nWhat’s more, Monteil said, is that magnetotactic bacteria are widespread in the environment, so even if Martin did find them in sea turtle tears, it would do little to prove the theory. Just because magnetic bacteria are present doesn’t mean they’re helping the animal navigate.\n\nBut then again, other theories are still entirely unproven, too — and some of them are a lot weirder.\n\n“I don’t think it is impossible,” Monteil said of sea turtles and other organisms using magnetic bacteria to navigate. “Nothing is impossible. Life is amazing and has found ways to do things that we couldn’t imagine centuries before.”",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the expression “money can’t buy happiness.” But take a look at the evidence, and you’ll discover an encouraging fact: Your money can buy happiness — for other people.\n\nNot all efforts to improve people’s well-being are equally effective, though. The best charities out there create hundreds of times more happiness per dollar than others, according to new findings published this month by research center Happier Lives Institute in the 2025 World Happiness Report, which ranks countries by happiness each year.\n\nThat means that if you donate your money to the right charities, it can buy a lot of happiness for the world’s neediest people at a stunningly low cost. For example, just $25 can meaningfully boost somebody’s happiness for a year, if you give it to an effective organization like StrongMinds, which treats depression in African countries.\n\nThe Happier Lives Institute figured this out by comparing the impact of different charities using a single standardized metric: the well-being year, or Wellby. It’s pretty straightforward: Imagine that someone asked you, “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays, on a scale from 0 to 10?” Producing one Wellby for you would mean increasing your life satisfaction by one point for one year.\n\nThe Happier Lives Institute is UK-based, so, for comparison’s sake, it showed how some of the world’s most cost-effective charities stack up against a few charities in the UK (the last six in the chart). As you can see, money donated to the top charities in poorer countries can improve lives much more per dollar than money donated within a rich country, because a dollar goes further abroad.\n\nTo give you a sense of what a few of the “best buy” charities do:\n\nThe case for making people happier — not just wealthier or healthier\n\nIt’s only in the past few years that experts have started evaluating charities using WELLBYs as their metric. Since economists love things they can measure objectively, they’ve spent the past century focusing on measuring health and wealth. The best programs have long been considered to be the ones that saved the most lives or increased GDP by the widest margin.\n\nBut as it’s become clear that increasing wealth and health doesn’t always go hand in hand with increasing happiness, a growing chorus of experts has argued that helping people is ultimately about making them happier — not just wealthier or healthier — and the best way to find out how happy people are is to just ask them directly. In other words, we should focus more on subjective well-being: how satisfied people are with their lives based on what they say matters most to them. That revolution in thinking has gathered steam to the point that it’s now featured in well-known, mainstream publications like the World Happiness Report.\n\nSome experts remain a bit skeptical about focusing on subjective well-being because it is, well, subjective.\n\n“I don’t really know what it means for someone to say ‘I’m a 6 out of 10’ in the way that I know what it means for someone to not have a broken arm,” Elie Hassenfeld, the co-founder and CEO of the charity evaluator GiveWell, told me a couple years ago. He also questioned whether a measure of subjective well-being gets at the things we really care about, things that make life worthwhile, like meaning.\n\nIt’s a fair question. But, according to the Happier Lives Institute’s Michael Plant, it shouldn’t stop us from using Wellbys. “Part of the virtue of the subjective approach is that people can bring whatever matters to them into their assessments” of how happy they are, he told me. “So, how much meaning you have in your life could be an input into that.”\n\nPlant also notes that although he’s trying to highlight the organizations that give you the most bang for your charitable buck, that doesn’t necessarily mean that other charities aren’t doing good work or aren’t worth funding at all. We don’t have to turn ourselves into mere optimizing machines — we can care about a diverse set of priorities and split our donations among a range of different charities.\n\nThe point, then, is not that you should ignore needy people in your local community, but that you may also want to look beyond that once you realize that you can make a much bigger difference to those living abroad.\n\n“If a friend told you they gave $200,000 to a charity, you’d probably be extremely impressed — that could be their life savings!” Plant and his colleagues write in the World Happiness Report. “However, it’s possible to have that sort of impact for a fraction of the cost: giving $1,000 to the best charities may do just as much good as $200,000 to a randomly selected one.”",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nVox reader Brian Diederich asks: Why and how do so many collegiate basketball teams — both men’s and women’s — now have so many international student-athletes?\n\nIf you’ve turned on March Madness this year, you’ve witnessed the most international players ever in college basketball’s signature competition.\n\nAcross both the men’s and women’s brackets, 264 athletes — 15 percent of all NCAA players in the tournaments — hailed from outside of the US. They are a cross-section of humanity, representing 45 countries in the women’s tournament and 52 in the men’s.\n\nThe number of overall international college basketball players more than doubled from 2010 to 2025. It is a trend across sports: 25,000 of all US college athletes were born in another country.\n\nForty years ago, US schools put little thought into recruiting players from Africa or Europe. A handful of players started to come to the US to play college ball in the 1980s, as the NBA was becoming more popular and thinking more globally. But international players were almost exclusively identified by word of mouth, recommendations from a friend of a friend. Sometimes, the US coaches wouldn’t even see any game tape before signing a player to a scholarship; in 1984, Dutch player Rik Smits got a scholarship offer from Marist University based on nothing but his height (7’4”); he says the coach never even saw him play.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut today, the NBA and NCAA have built out an international pipeline for players, while the internet has made it easier than ever to scout from abroad. A lot has changed.\n\nWhat has driven more international recruitment in college basketball?\n\nNBA legend Hakeem Olajuwon, who came to the US in 1980 to play NCAA basketball, is a pivotal figure in this evolution. Then a relatively unknown Nigerian teenager, he was offered a chance to try out for the University of Houston’s team because a coach had heard from an acquaintance that Olajuwon was a promising prospect. After his star college career and a successful transition to the pros, Olajuwon had set the blueprint.\n\nOlajuwon became one of the NBA’s best players in the ’80s and ’90s, winning an NBA MVP and two championships. His rise was paralleled by Jamaica’s Patrick Ewing, who moved from Kingston to play high school basketball in the US before attending Georgetown and then going on to make the New York Knicks one of the consistently best in the league. Smits played for 12 seasons and made one All-Star team.\n\nTheir success, and the next generation of players who followed, pushed the NBA — and, with it, college basketball — on the path to globalization. By the turn of the century, even elite prep schools were starting to recruit international players.\n\nA recruiting arms race got underway in the ’80s and ’90s, and then an NCAA rule change in 2010 made it easier for more international players to come to the US.\n\nBasketball is typically one of the most popular and most profitable athletic programs that a university will have, second only to football if the school has a football team — and for some schools, like Duke, basketball still maintains primacy. The pressure to compete is intense. If you’re at the University of North Carolina and you see your top rival, the Blue Devils, recruiting abroad, you are going to start doing the same thing. International recruitment went from happenstance in the ’80s to an indispensable recruitment tactic that teams across the NCAA used to keep up.\n\nIn 2001, the NBA doubled down on the strategy and set up a formal pipeline, the Basketball Without Borders program, to get promising international players in front of American scouts. The NBA has more recently set up academic training camps that teach basketball skills while also offering more general education classes to prepare participants for a US college experience.\n\nThe program proved to be a success. One of Basketball Without Borders’s graduates is Joel Embiid, a Cameroonian player who came to basketball as a teenager, played as a Kansas Jayhawk, and won an MVP at the professional level in 2023.\n\nTechnology helped revolutionize basketball recruiting. In 1984, Rik Smits’s Marist coach had to hope that somebody had recorded Smits playing on some grainy VHS tape and then physically get his hands on that tape. Without that, he had nothing to go on but height. Today, player highlights from all over the world are uploaded to YouTube — where American coaches can view them easily at any time, and players can even build hype on social media to get attention from recruiters.\n\nThose recruiters are offering players not only the chance to come to the US for an education — they’re also offering a financial opportunity.\n\nHow has money in college sports affected international recruitment?\n\nMoney is changing everything about what it means to be a college athlete — including for international players.\n\nAn opportunity to make money for themselves — and not just for the schools — is steering even more foreign basketballers to US colleges. NCAA athletes can now earn money through endorsements and other activities thanks to the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rule that took effect in 2021.\n\nIn the ’90s and early 2000s, as international recruitment was spreading, playing college basketball wasn’t necessarily the smart move for the most elite foreign players. They could instead play in the expanding overseas professional leagues, earn a salary, and then enter the NBA draft without ever attending a US school. And that path was well trod: Luka Dončić, the subject of a media frenzy after his trade to the Los Angeles Lakers, played in the EuroLeague and leapt to the NBA in 2018 — three years before the NIL provision took effect.\n\nBut today, you can make real money playing college basketball in America and earn a salary that rivals those of foreign professional leagues. International players do have to jump through some extra hoops, as students on an immigration visa earning money raises legal questions, but athletes and their sponsoring institutions are quickly becoming savvy about how to navigate that issue.\n\nThe potential to make money while in school might even convince some players to stay in the college game longer instead of jumping to the NBA as quickly as possible.\n\nMichigan center Vladislav Goldin, who was born in Russia, helped lead the Wolverines to their Sweet 16 berth last weekend, but he almost wasn’t there at all: He’d declared for the NBA draft in spring 2024, but changed his mind and transferred from Florida International University to the U of M, a more prestigious program with more earning opportunities.\n\nA decade or two ago, that would have been unthinkable. But the business of college basketball has changed — and so have the players.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nFederal law seeks to make communications technology like telephones and the internet, in the words of one older statute, “available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States.” A longstanding federal program that seeks to implement this goal is now before the Supreme Court, in a case known as FCC v. Consumers’ Research, and the stakes could be enormous.\n\nIf the Supreme Court accepts an argument raised by a federal appeals court, which struck down the federal program, it would bring about one of the biggest judicial power grabs in American history, and hobble the government’s ability to do, well, pretty much anything.\n\nThe Court will hear arguments in Consumers’ Research on March 26.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nWhile Congress has long called for universal service for telecommunications and similar technology, there are practical obstacles to this goal, especially in rural areas that are far more expensive to wire because residents are more spread out. In these areas, if telephone and internet providers charged a fair market rate, their services could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nWhich is why Congress created the Universal Service Fund. It effectively taxes telephone and internet service providers, and uses that money to pay for service to underserved communities. As a practical matter, service providers pass the cost of these taxes on to their customers in urban and other cheap-to-serve areas, so Americans living in cities wind up subsidizing telephone and internet in more sparsely populated regions of the country.\n\nBecause the amount of money the Fund must raise to achieve universal service will vary from year to year, Congress also tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with determining how much money the Fund should collect from service providers each year. The statute also provides the FCC with detailed instructions on how to determine the amount it should collect, and how that money should be spent.\n\nThis program has hummed along without incident for nearly three decades — the Fund was created in 1996 — until the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit abruptly declared it unconstitutional. If you’re familiar with the Fifth Circuit’s work, you know that this kind of thing is common. The Fifth Circuit is the most right-wing appeals court in the federal system, and its judges often strike down decades-old laws based on unusually creative interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nRelated The Trumpiest court in America\n\nThe Supreme Court, despite its 6-3 Republican majority, hands down a few cases every year reversing these Fifth Circuit decisions. Last May, for example, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s attempt to strike down an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nNevertheless, the Consumers’ Research case is worth watching for two reasons. One is that the Fifth Circuit’s decision was authored by Judge Andy Oldham, a Trump appointee who is widely considered a strong candidate for promotion to the Supreme Court in this administration. Oldham’s opinions are often sloppy, and his opinion in Consumers’ Research is no exception.\n\nThe second is that Oldham relied on a legal doctrine known as “nondelegation” in his opinion targeting the Universal Service Fund. The nondelegation doctrine claims there are strict constitutional limits on Congress’s power to empower federal agencies to do all kinds of things, from limiting pollution from power plants, to setting minimum standards for health insurance, to, at least if Oldham gets his way, providing broadband to rural communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court has only invoked this doctrine twice, both times in 1935, to strike down a federal law, and its decisions since then hold that the doctrine is more or less dead. Still, five of the Republican justices have, at various times, advocated for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. So there is a real risk that the Court could use the Consumers’ Research case as a vehicle to do so.\n\nIf that happens, it would shift a simply enormous amount of power from the elected branches of government to the judiciary. And it could potentially strip the federal government of a whole lot more than its power to equalize telephone and internet rates.\n\nWhy are the stakes in Consumers’ Research so high?\n\nCongress frequently enacts laws which lay out a general policy, then task a federal agency with implementing that policy and determining how to achieve it. The law creating the Universal Service Fund, for example, lays out the broad goal of taxing communications service providers and using that money to ensure that everyone has access to those services. But it is also recognized that the amount of money that needs to be raised to achieve this goal, as well as the question of how that money should be distributed, is a moving target that needs to be periodically reassessed by the FCC.\n\nOther laws delegate authority to an agency because technology evolves, and agencies employ experts who can monitor that technology and update federal policy accordingly. The Clear Air Act, for example, declares that certain power plants should use the “best system of emission reduction” that currently exists, while also accounting for factors such as costs. Because Congress recognized that the best system in 2025 will be more advanced than the best system that existed in 1972, it also tasked the EPA with determining what that system is and updating federal power plant regulations so that those plants use modern technology.\n\nThe stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions.\n\nThe idea behind the nondelegation doctrine is that the Constitution limits Congress’s power to delegate power to agencies in this way, but there’s a big problem with it: The doctrine appears nowhere in the Constitution itself, so judges who wish to apply it cannot refer to any text to determine which delegations of power are not allowed. If nondelegation were revived, the only real factor governing which congressional delegations are allowed, and which ones must be struck down, would be whether five justices wanted to strike a particular law down.\n\nMany right-leaning legal scholars have argued that this extraconstitutional doctrine is implicit in the Constitution, but it’s noteworthy that the people who actually wrote the Constitution disagreed with them. The First Congress made sweeping delegations of power to executive branch officials, giving them, among other things, the power to set regulations governing “all things touching” trade with Indigenous tribes, and the power to grant patents so long as they “deem the invention or discovery sufficiently useful or important.”\n\nAnd so the Supreme Court has historically treated the nondelegation doctrine with extraordinary suspicion. The Court did apply it twice, in 1935, to New Deal statutes which gave virtually unbounded power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but it has never done so again. Supreme Court decisions stretching back nearly a century permit Congress to delegate authority to federal agencies, so long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.”\n\nThough the current Supreme Court has not, at least not yet, struck down a law on nondelegation grounds, it did invent a similar legal doctrine — which, like nondelegation, cannot be found in the Constitution itself — known as the “major questions doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a majority of the Court may veto any action by a federal agency which five justices believe to be too politically or economically significant.\n\nRelated How the Supreme Court put itself in charge of the executive branch\n\nSo the stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions. But there’s also an important difference between major questions and nondelegation.\n\nUnder the major questions doctrine, the proper remedy, if five justices wish to veto an agency action, is to block that specific action — but to otherwise leave the federal law permitting the agency to act intact. The nondelegation doctrine, by contrast, often calls upon federal courts to toss out a statute delegating power to a federal agency altogether.\n\nBasically, the Court has already given itself the power to make a targeted strike on any individual agency action it doesn’t like, but it could use Consumers’ Research to carpet bomb agencies’ authority, stripping them of any power to act in the future.\n\nOldham’s Consumers’ Research opinion is extremely sloppy\n\nOne reason the justices might stay their hands in Consumers’ Research is that this case is a poor vehicle for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. The statute governing the Universal Service Fund provides detailed instructions to the FCC on how it should exercise its authority — far more detail than Congress provided in many other statutes that the Supreme Court has upheld against nondelegation challenges, including cases involving executive branch policy on navigable waters, natural gas rates, and commodity prices. Some of the statutes upheld by the Supreme Court do little more than instruct agencies to remove “unreasonable” obstacles to commerce.\n\nOldham should have followed these decisions, as he should have followed the Court’s precedents requiring him to uphold the Universal Service Fund statute so long as it provides an “intelligible principle” that the FCC can use to guide its decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund statute lays out six goals that the FCC should accomplish, in its efforts to provide telecommunications access to rural and poor communities. It specifies who should be taxed (“Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute”), and who should benefit from this tax revenue. And it instructs the FCC on how to determine the rate of taxation.\n\nOne provision, for example, states that rural customers should receive service “at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.” Thus, the FCC must tax service providers at a high enough rate to ensure that rural customers pay similar rates to urban customers, but not at such a high rate that rural customers pay significantly less than urban customers.\n\nThere’s simply no question, in other words, that the Universal Service Fund statute provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the FCC’s decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund would likely survive judicial review even under a more aggressive approach to nondelegation favored by some members of the Court. Dissenting in Gundy v. United States (2019), for example, Justice Neil Gorsuch proposed replacing the intelligible principle standard with a vague new rule providing that Congress must put “forth standards ‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed” whenever it delegates power. Here, Congress has laid out definite and precise rules governing who the FCC should tax, how much it should tax them, and how that revenue should be spent.\n\nSo how, then, did Oldham justify striking down the Universal Service Fund? The answer is he took extraordinary liberties with the law, ignoring most of the statute, openly defying the Supreme Court’s decisions, and simply making up new rules along the way.\n\nAt one point, for example, Oldham claims that only two provisions of the statute are “relevant” to determining whether it violates the nondelegation doctrine — a provision stating that the FCC should raise funds “sufficient…to preserve and advance universal service,” and another provision indicating telecommunications services “should be available at…affordable rates.”\n\nIf these were the only instructions the statute provided to the FCC, then Consumers’ Research might be a more difficult case. But, of course, Congress said a whole lot more than these two things when it instructed the FCC on how to wield its authority.\n\nOldham also relies on a concurring opinion, by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones, which the Supreme Court repudiated last spring. He places a simply enormous amount of weight on the fact that the FCC created a corporation, known as the Universal Service Administrative Company, which advises it on how to set Universal Service Fund rates. But the Supreme Court held in Sunshine Anthracite Coal v. Adkins (1940) that these sorts of advisory bodies are “unquestionably valid.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Oldham started with the result he wanted — striking down the Universal Service Fund — and then wrote an opinion pretending that the law actually supports his preferred outcome.\n\nSo how is the Supreme Court likely to approach this case?\n\nRealistically, it is unlikely that even this Supreme Court will strike down the Universal Service Fund. The statute is too detailed, and Oldham’s opinion is too nonsensically argued, to justify the result the Fifth Circuit wants to achieve.\n\nOne thing to watch out for, however, is whether the Republican justices attempt to shift the law governing nondelegation cases, while still upholding the Fund. The Court could, for example, write an opinion repudiating the intelligible principle test and upholding the Fund under Gorsuch’s “sufficiently definite and precise” standard — a standard that, because of its vagueness, would give judges far more discretion to strike down laws they do not like on nondelegation grounds.\n\nSo, while Oldham is unlikely to succeed in his ambitious attempt to sabotage the Fund, he may nonetheless achieve a significant victory. By ignoring the law in his Consumers’ Research opinion, Oldham gave the justices an opportunity to revive a dangerous legal doctrine, and to do so in an opinion that appears moderate compared to the reactionary Fifth Circuit.",

Being rejected is seen as, at worst, an embarrassing personal failure, and, at best, an obstacle standing in the way of our hearts’ desires: a dream job, a thriving social circle, a first date with a gorgeous future partner. Last year, it dawned on me that I was actively avoiding rejection in my writing career in order to keep myself safe — and small. So I set my sights on denial.\n\nI dreamed up a project called November of NO and gathered an online group of 15 people to join me in my quest. “We’ll build resilience by inviting no’s into our lives, all in the pursuit of getting to yes,” my pitch went. The point was to make rejection itself the goalpost to reduce the fear and stickiness around it, and simultaneously get closer to our objectives. We set goals to eagerly get rejected from job applications, film grants, pitches (my personal goal as a freelance journalist), and other targets of our yearnings. Each week, we logged our attempts, rejections, and finally, any yeses we received.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

When I shifted my attention to rejection rather than success, it felt so much easier to do the work — my perfectionism-forward world was topsy-turvy, and getting a no was suddenly worth celebrating. By the end of the month, I had racked up seven rejections and landed three new editorial assignments.\n\nSera Bonds, a November of No group member who has long worked in nonprofit development, says she sent out around 80 total asks that month. It was also her first time tracking the number of rejections she received, even though rampant rejection has been a part of her work for 30 years.\n\n“I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\n“I feel like about five years in, I really learned that there’s a critical mass of nos you have to get to get to the number of yeses you need, and it really has nothing to do with me,” Bonds says. “When I ask somebody for money, or I’m looking for a contract or a collaboration, most of the time the reason they say no is something on their end. So now I just trust it, and I don’t take it personally.”\n\nBond says that attitude has seeped into other parts of her life, too. “I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\nLearning to see rejection as opportunity rather than failure can lead to more satisfaction in many aspects of life, from work and personal goals to dating and building strong relationships, experts say. And research has long shown that having high rejection sensitivity can mean developing low self-esteem; avoiding closeness in relationships, especially romantic ones; and is linked to a higher risk of other mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\nPlus, failing, regrouping, and getting back up again builds resilience. As the adage goes, you miss every shot you don’t take — and even missed shots can help you take better aim.\n\nRyan C. Warner, a psychologist and consultant, trains his leadership and business clients to adopt a “rejection mindset,” which means learning to approach rejection rather than avoid it. “It’s teaching individuals to deliberately seek out situations where they may fail and, ultimately, that helps build confidence that they will succeed.”\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong.”\n\nOur aversion to rejection is deeply rooted in evolutionary psychology, Warner says. Fitting into social groups helps ensure our survival, so we instinctively learned to avoid any behavior that caused a negative social reaction. Rejection triggers a response in the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions as well as our “fight or flight” instinct.\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong,” Warner says. “You need to react, or you need to avoid, so you don’t feel that pain anymore. … When this is constantly reinforced, it will ultimately recreate that fear of future rejection internally, [and lead to] avoidance.”\n\nSome neurodivergent people might experience rejection aversion even more acutely. Some 6 percent of American adults have ADHD, and people with ADHD can experience rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD), or intense emotional pain when faced with rejection.\n\nAnushka Basu, a 29-year-old finance writer based in India, was diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing extreme social anxiety during college, and later RSD, which she says starts subtle but, eventually, “freezes my body and mind.” It was a long process for Basu to learn how to better handle rejection, she says.\n\n“It starts with friends and family pointing out your shortcomings,” she wrote in an email. “Then, we go on to internalize it, and before we know it, it paralyzes us. So, in essence, we reject our own selves before anyone else.”\n\nHow to have a better relationship to rejection\n\nIt is possible for each of us to build more tolerance to rejection, and even to grow our self-confidence and self-acceptance as we do it. The key is to learn to understand “no” as a hallway to the next room rather than a closed door in your face — and that it’s not usually personal.\n\nHelping people with RSD conquer fear of rejection is a key part of the work that therapist Billy Roberts, founder of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio, does with his clients. “Ultimately, if someone tells you no, the default isn’t that they think you’re worthless or that they think you’re a bad person or not good enough,” Roberts says. “You’ve got to learn to manage your emotions so that you can put yourself out there again — and then eventually you win, because you’re putting yourself in situations where winning is a possibility.”\n\n1) Create rejection goals\n\nWarner recommends deciding on an aspect of your life you want to improve or change, then creating tangible goals. He finds the SMART framework helpful — that is, setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This means your goals are actually achievable and trackable over time, and you’ll know whether or not you hit them. For example, if you want to date more, you might set a SMART goal to go on five dates in the next three months, or meet five new people — which necessarily entails putting yourself out there more. Just make sure your goals are realistic.\n\n“I think it’s definitely effective for people, having measurable [goals] that you feel like you’re making progress toward,” Roberts says. “But people set themselves up and they’re like, ‘I’m going to apply for 100 jobs this week,’ and then they have a hard time taking action on that.”\n\nCarla Birnberg, an author who writes a newsletter about building habits for a successful life, first got more comfortable with rejection when she was shopping her book manuscript around 2000. “It definitely desensitized me to rejection,” she says. Now, she has a goal to get rejected as a podcast guest five times a week. “I would love to be on two podcasts a month, but I know five rejections a week is the only way to get there,” Birnberg says. “It brings me closer to that yes.”\n\nShe also uses people’s responses and feedback to refine her message, and hopefully get a higher response and approval rate as she goes along. “Rejections aren’t all the same,” she says.\n\n2) Reflect on your rejection hangups\n\nBoth meditation and journaling are easy and inexpensive ways to get to know yourself better, and have proven mental health benefits. They can also help you interrogate your response to rejection. “Ask yourself, ‘What are some times I may be rejecting myself?’” Warner says. You can also get guided support from a professional with therapy or counseling.\n\nWhen Basu realized she didn’t want to define herself through rejection, she began to analyze rejections in her journal, asking herself why each situation did not work out as she had hoped or expected. Then, she wrote down things she learned, what she could do differently next time, and how this rejection might change her future for good. She began to notice that some rejections weren’t personal, and took note of her own resilience.\n\n“In hindsight, I noticed moments where I thought rejection spelled the end, yet I ended up with something better down the line,” Basu says. “I started telling myself, ‘I am good enough.’ … Over time, I started to view rejection as a part of the process towards finding the right prospects. And I began looking at job applications as a numbers game. I knew that at least one would land if I kept at it. I started to view rejections as a need for redirection instead of failure.”\n\n3) Trust that rejection can get easier — and builds confidence\n\nThe catch-22 of rejection is that you have to experience it, recover, and try, try again to “get that positive feedback loop going,” Roberts says. The more rejections you sail through, the easier it will get, and, eventually, the more you’ll discover that risk, and even straight up rejection, does reap rewards.\n\nRoberts wants to remind people that “action comes before healing,” meaning it’s only through repeatedly being rejected, processing your emotions, and moving forward that you will eventually have a reduction in anxiety around rejection.",

        "content": "is an editorial director at Vox overseeing the climate, tech, and world teams, and is the editor of Vox’s Future Perfect section. He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nI was an English major in college, and my favorite poet was the first-generation Romantic William Wordsworth. For one thing, there’s the name, the best example of nominative determinism in the annals of English literature.\n\nBut what I most love about Wordsworth is the way he acts as a bridge between the formal, at times stultified style of the poetry that came before him, and the dawn of a new era that venerated individual emotion and experience — both the good and the ill. All that comes together in one of my favorite Wordsworth poems: “Surprised by Joy”\n\nLove, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind-- But how could I forget thee? Through what power, Even for the least division of an hour, Have I been so beguiled as to be blind To my most grievous loss?\n\nBeneath the archaic language, the “thees” and so forth, the verse describes a father who is temporarily distracted from his loss by a moment of joy, only to recall with agonizing suddenness that the one person he wishes to share it with — his young child — is gone. The “surprise” in “Surprised by Joy” is that it was possible, even for the briefest moment, for the poet not to be consumed by that “most grievous loss.”\n\nLike most of Wordsworth’s poems, “Surprised by Joy” was drawn from his personal experience — in this case, the loss of his daughter Catherine in 1812, when she was just three years old. Wordsworth and his wife Mary had five children, two of whom died young: Catherine, and their son Thomas, who passed away from measles at age 6, just a half year after Catherine’s death.\n\nTo lose two young children in less than a calendar year is a grief I cannot fathom. But it was unbearably common at the time. Nearly one in every three children in England in 1800 died before the age of 5. In 1900 in the US, the death rate for children was nearly one in five, as my Vox colleague Anna North wrote recently. Look back over the full course of human history, and it is estimated that nearly one in every two children died before reaching their 15th birthday.\n\nIt might be comforting, perhaps, to pretend that the parents of the past weren’t as affected with the death of a child, because it was so common. After all, family sizes used to be much larger, in part because of the ubiquity of childhood mortality.\n\nYet Wordsworth’s lines bury that comfort in the graveyard where it belongs. In 2025, in 1812, in 2000 BC, the death of a young child is the worst thing that could happen to any parent.\n\nThe most important number in the world\n\nYou’re probably wondering, “Where’s the good news?” Here it is: The rate of childhood mortality is now far, far lower than it once was. Best of all, it’s continuing to drop.\n\nIn 1990, 12.8 million children died before the age of 5, but in the years since that number has fallen by more than 60 percent. According to new data released by the UN this week, the number of under-5 deaths fell to a record-low of 4.8 million in 2023.\n\nAt Vox’s Future Perfect, the section I run, we like to refer to the drastic drop in child mortality as the most important statistic in the world, for several reasons:\n\nIf a child can make it to their fifth birthday, it significantly increases their chance of living a full life. Given that life expectancy overall has increased hugely as well , that can mean the difference between a life of a few years and one that extends to 70 years or more. With millions of children alive today who would have been dead just a few decades ago, that adds up to billions of years of additional life.\n\nChild mortality is one of the most important indicators of a country’s development. As the chart above shows, rich nations like the UK and the US first made progress in keeping children alive, but more recently poorer nations like India have made tremendous strides. (Child mortality dropped an astounding 81 percent between 1980 and today in India.)\n\nThe reduction in child mortality is perhaps the best example of the international community setting a goal and making major progress toward it. In 2000, the UN aimed to reduce child mortality to two-thirds below 1990 levels by 2015. While we didn’t quite make it by then, we’re almost there now. Global health is a bright spot compared to the struggles in making progress on climate change.\n\nWe shouldn’t need economic motivations to want to reduce child deaths, but reduced childhood mortality is also associated with better economic performance. Family sizes fall to a more manageable level in poor countries, and more future workers survive to a productive age.\n\nHow did we get here — and where are we going?\n\nThere is no secret formula to reducing child mortality. Improved prenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care all keep children alive in their vulnerable first months. Better sanitation and nutrition prevent early deaths from waterborne illnesses and malnutrition.\n\nVaccines have, of course, saved untold millions of children from once common killers like measles, diphtheria and polio. (Let me say this again louder for those in the back row, especially if any of you happen to currently be running the Department of Health and Human Services: VACCINES!)\n\nDespite this tremendous success, 4.8 million children — approximately the population of Phoenix — still die before their fifth birthday, which is exactly 4.8 million too many. The world would have to reduce child mortality by an additional 30 percent or so to meet the new UN goal of essentially ending preventable child deaths 2030.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re not on that trajectory. While the number of child deaths is still declining, progress has been slowing down, and that was before the massive cuts in foreign aid in the US and other countries. The highest levels of child mortality today are found in extremely poor sub-Saharan African nations like Chad and Mali where aid will be the difference between life and death.\n\nHere in the US, the turn away from childhood vaccines risks reintroducing long-conquered killers of children. The fact that an unvaccinated child in Texas recently died of the measles — the same disease that took Wordsworth’s son Thomas, back when there was no protection from the virus — should horrify all of us.\n\nWhether it is through resurrecting the most effective forms of foreign aid, or reconfirming our trust in vaccines that have saved millions, it is in our power to eventually end preventable child deaths. We can ensure that one day no parent will experience the pain suffered by William Wordsworth and by countless parents before and after him. Such an achievement would be a joy that lasts.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court appeared Monday to be leaning toward a Catholic charitable organization pushing back against the state of Wisconsin in the latest religious rights case to come before the court.\n\nListen to the Supreme Court arguments in our player above.\n\nIn a case that could have wide-ranging effects, the justices suggested the Catholic Charities Bureau should not have to pay unemployment taxes because the work of the social services agency is motivated by religious beliefs, and the state exempts religious groups from the tax.\n\n“Isn’t it a fundamental principle of our First Amendment that the state shouldn’t be picking and choosing between religions?” Justice Neil Gorsuch said.\n\nLIVE RESULTS: Wisconsin Supreme Court special election\n\nThe dispute is one of three cases involving religion under consideration this term by the justices who have issued a string of decisions siding with churches and religious plaintiffs. The others involve religious objections to books read in public schools and public funding for religious schools.\n\nThe charities don’t qualify for the tax exemption because the day-to-day services it provides don’t involve religious teachings, Colin Roth, an attorney for Wisconsin, argued. Catholic Charities has paid the tax for over 50 years, and if the court finds it can claim the exemption that could open the door to big employers like religiously affiliated hospitals pulling out of the state unemployment system as well, he said.\n\nWhile Roth faced a grilling from both liberal and conservative justices, some like Amy Coney Barrett also raised questions about how far such exemptions would go. “One of the problems here is figuring out what the line is,” she said.\n\nWATCH: Supreme Court upholds Biden regulation making ghost guns easier to trace\n\nThe Trump administration weighed in to support the charity, urging the court to toss out a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling siding with the state. The state high court misinterpreted a federal law when it found that both the motivations and the work itself has to be religious for organizations to avoid paying the tax, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.\n\n“I do think that the Wisconsin Supreme Court deserves to know that it was incorrect,” he said.\n\nThe arguments coincidentally come the day before a closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election that’s drawn the involvement of billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk.\n\nCatholic Charites argues the state supreme court decision violates religious freedoms protected by the First Amendment by making determinations about what work qualifies as religious.\n\nWATCH: What justices said during a critical Supreme Court hearing on redistricting and race\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan was among those questioning Wisconsin’s contention that one way organizations can get the exemption is by actively proselytizing. Some faiths, she pointed out, purposely avoid attempting to convert people. “I thought it was pretty fundamental that we don’t treat some religions better than other religions,” she said.\n\nWisconsin exempts church-controlled organizations from unemployment tax if they are operated primarily for religious purposes. The Catholic Charities Bureau, though, has paid the tax since 1972. Much of the groups’ funding is from public money, and neither employees or people receiving services have to subscribe to any faith, according to court papers from the state.\n\nIf the Supreme Court sides with the charity, employees would be covered by the faith’s unemployment system, an option it argues is better than the state’s system. The state says the costs are about the same, but the state offers more due process for employees who feel claims were wrongly denied.\n\nA decision is expected by late June.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Kid Rock into the Oval Office on Monday and signed an executive order that he says will help curb ticket scalping and bring “commonsense” changes to the way live events are priced.\n\n“Anyone who’s bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years — no matter what your politics are — knows that it’s a conundrum,” said Kid Rock, who wore a red bedazzled suit featuring an American flag motif and a straw fedora.\n\nDesigned to stop “price-gouging by middlemen,” the order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to ensure that scalpers offering tickets at higher prices than their face value comply with all Internal Revenue Service rules.\n\nREAD MORE: Here’s a running list of clashes between Ticketmaster, fans and artists\n\nIt also orders the Federal Trade Commission to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process” and to “take enforcement action to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary ticketing market,” which the Trump administration argues can restore sensibility and order to the ticket market.\n\nTrump said he knows Kid Rock, a longtime supporter whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, as simply “Bob.”\n\n“He’s been a good friend for a long time,” Trump said.\n\nThe president said rising fees for concerts and other events have “gotten worse and worse with time.” Kid Rock agreed.\n\nWATCH: Senators question Ticketmaster over monopoly concerns, botched Taylor Swift ticket sale\n\n“You can buy a ticket for $100. By the time you check out, it’s $170. You don’t know what you’ve been charged for,” Kid Rock said. “But, more importantly, the bots, you know, they come in, they get all the good tickets to your favorite shows you want to go to, and then they’re relisted immediately for sometimes 400-500% markup.”\n\nThe order mostly directs federal agencies to enforce existing laws. Still, it marks a rare instance of policy crossover with the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden, which used the FTC to target “ junk fees,” or levies tacked on at the end of the purchase process that can mask the full price of things like concert tickets, hotel rooms and utility bills.\n\nUnder Biden, the Justice Department also sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, last year. It accused them of running an illegal monopoly over live events and asked a court to break up the system that squelches competition and drives up prices for fans.\n\nLive Nation said Monday evening that “scalpers and bots prevent fans from getting tickets at the prices artists set, and we thank President Trump for taking them head-on.”\n\nREAD MORE: Federal judge blocks Trump administration from dismantling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\n“We support any meaningful resale reforms,” the company said in a statement, adding that that included backing caps on resale prices. Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino also thanked Trump and Kid Rock in a post on X.\n\nThose companies have a history of clashing with major artists, including Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. whose summer 2022 stadium tour was plagued by difficulty getting tickets. Country music star Zach Bryan even released a 2022 album titled “All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster.”\n\nA representative for Bryan said he had “nothing to add” when asked to comment on the executive order.\n\nThe Biden administration used such initiatives as a way to protect consumers from rising prices that were already inflated. Trump, meanwhile, campaigned on combating high ticket prices, calling them “very unfortunate.”\n\nKid Rock, known for hits like “Cowboy” and “Bawitdaba,” called Trump’s order a ”great first step” and said he’d eventually like to see a cap on resale prices on tickets — while quickly adding, “I’m a capitalist.” He also said he’d spoken to Ticketmaster, which he described as “on board” with the change.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump plans to launch more tariffs on April 2. Here’s what it could mean for you\n\nThe White House says America’s live concert and entertainment industry has a total nationwide economic impact of $132.6 billion and supports 913,000 jobs, “But it has become blighted by unscrupulous middle-men who impose egregious fees on fans with no benefit to artists,” according to a fact sheet it released Monday.\n\nTrump’s order further directs federal officials and the FTC to deliver a report in six months “summarizing actions taken to address the issue of unfair practices in the live concert and entertainment industry and recommend additional regulations or legislation needed to protect consumers in this industry.”\n\n“Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses,” the White House face sheet said.\n\nIt also noted that higher prices don’t mean additional profits for artists but instead go “solely to the scalper and the ticketing agency.”\n\nKid Rock agreed that such markups don’t benefit artists like himself, then chuckled while offering, “I’ll be the first one to say, and I know the president doesn’t like when I say this, but, I’m a little overpaid right now.”\n\n“It’s kind of ridiculous. I would rather be, you know, a hero to working-class people and have them be able to come attend my shows and give them a fair ticket price,” he said. “I can’t control that right now so hopefully this is a step to make that happen.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Sherman contributed to this report from New York.",

        "content": "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker carried an all-night speech in protest of President Donald Trump’s agenda into Tuesday morning.\n\nWatch Booker speak in the player above.\n\nBooker took to the Senate floor on Monday evening saying he would remain there as long as he was “physically able.” He was still on the floor more than 14 hours later.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker said at the start of his speech. “And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”\n\nBooker railed against cuts to Social Security offices and spoke to concerns that broader cuts to the social safety net could be coming, though Republican lawmakers say the program won’t be touched.\n\nDonning and doffing reading glasses, Booker read what he said were letters from constituents. One writer was alarmed by the Republican president’s talk of annexing Greenland and Canada and a “looming constitutional crisis.”\n\n“I hear you. I see you, and I’m standing here in part because of letters like yours,” Booker said.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Booker got some help from Democratic colleagues, who gave him a break from speaking to ask him a question. Booker said he would yield for questions but would not give up the Senate floor.\n\nAccording to the Senate’s website, the record for the longest individual speech belongs to Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nBooker invoked Thurmond and the civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Tuesday morning, arguing that changing history would require the public to get involved.\n\n“You think we got civil rights one day because Strom Thurmond — after filibustering for 24 hours — you think we got civil rights because he came to the floor one day and said, ‘I’ve seen the light,'” Booker said. “No, we got civil rights because people marched for it, sweat for it and John Lewis bled for it.”\n\nBooker, 55, is serving his second term in the Senate. He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2020, when he launched his campaign from the steps of his home in Newark. He dropped out after struggling to gain a foothold in a packed field, falling short of a threshold to meet in a January 2020 debate.\n\nBefore taking to the national political stage, Booker was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, serving as mayor of Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, from 2006 to 2013. A Rhodes Scholar and graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law, he started his career as an attorney for nonprofits. He served on the Newark City Council before becoming the city’s mayor.\n\nHe was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2013 during a special election held after the death of incumbent Democrat Frank Lautenberg. He won his first full-term in 2014 and then reelection in 2020.\n\nBooker was at the helm in Newark when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced a $100 million donation to improve the city’s schools in 2010. Roughly a decade ago, Zuckerberg told the AP a major lesson from Newark being applied in later donations was to make sure the desires of the public are considered.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, N.J.",

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church.

It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Two election watchdog organizations sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday over his executive order seeking to overhaul the nation’s elections through a proof-of-citizenship requirement, new mail ballot deadline restrictions and other sweeping changes.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Campaign Legal Center and the State Democracy Defenders Fund in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asks the court to declare the order unconstitutional and stop it from being implemented.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump signs action requiring proof of citizenship for voters, other measures overhauling U.S. elections\n\nIt names three nonprofit voter advocacy organizations as plaintiffs that it alleges are harmed by the order: the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Secure Families Initiative and the Arizona Students’ Association.\n\n“The president’s executive order is an unlawful action that threatens to uproot our tried-and-tested election systems and silence potentially millions of Americans,” said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center. “It is simply not within the president’s authority to set election rules by executive decree, especially when they would restrict access to voting in this way.”\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMonday’s lawsuit marks the first major legal challenge to last week’s executive order, which election lawyers have warned may violate the U.S. Constitution and asserts power they say the president does not have over an independent agency. That agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, sets voluntary voting system guidelines and maintains the federal voter registration form.\n\nIt comes as Congress is considering codifying a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration into law, and as Trump has promised more actions related to elections in the coming weeks.\n\nREAD MORE: Musk PAC spends big and goes door-to-door in Wisconsin Supreme Court race\n\nThe lawsuit draws attention to the Constitution’s “ Elections Clause,” which says states — not the president — get to decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. That section of the Constitution also gives Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but it doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration.\n\n“The Constitution is clear: States set their own rules of the road when it comes to elections, and only Congress has the power to override these laws with respect to federal elections,” said Lang, calling the executive order an “unconstitutional executive overreach.”\n\nThe lawsuit also argues the president’s order intrudes on Americans’ right to vote.\n\nTrump, one of the top spreaders of election falsehoods, has argued this executive order will secure the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens. Multiple studies and investigations in individual states have shown that noncitizens casting ballots in federal elections, already a felony, is exceedingly rare.\n\nMonday’s lawsuit against Trump’s elections order could be just the first of many challenges. Other voting rights advocates have said they’re considering legal action, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Democratic attorney Marc Elias. Several Democratic state attorneys general have said they are looking closely at the order and suspect it is illegal.\n\nREAD MORE: Bondi instructs Justice Department to dismiss lawsuit challenging Georgia election law\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.\n\nIf courts determine the order can stand, the changes Trump is demanding are likely to cause some headaches for both election administrators and voters. State election officials, who already have lost some federal cybersecurity assistance, would have to spend time and money to comply with the order, including potentially buying new voting systems and educating voters of the rules.\n\nThe proof-of-citizenship requirement also could cause confusion or voter disenfranchisement because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. In Kansas, which had a proof-of-citizenship requirement for three years before it was overturned, the state’s own expert estimated that almost all the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote during the time it was in effect were U.S. citizens who had been eligible.\n\nMonday’s lawsuit is the latest of numerous efforts to fight the flurry of executive actions Trump has taken during the first months of his second term. Federal judges have partially or fully blocked many of them, including efforts to restrict birthright citizenship, ban transgender people from military service and curb diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives among federal contractors and grant recipients.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be “Liberation Day” — a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods.\n\nThe details of Trump’s next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes.\n\nIt is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them.\n\nWATCH: White House says Trump’s signing of ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs will be first Rose Garden event\n\n“I’m certainly open to it, if we can do something,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll get something for it.”\n\nAt stake are family budgets, America’s prominence as the world’s leading financial power and the structure of the global economy.\n\nHere’s what you should know about the impending trade penalties.\n\nWhat exactly does Trump plan to do?\n\nHe wants to announce import taxes, including “reciprocal” tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries.\n\nAs he announced 25 percent auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports.\n\n“This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,” Trump said. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years. They’ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe.”\n\nREAD MORE: Europe criticizes Trump auto tariffs, warning of economic threat to both continents\n\nIn an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced.\n\n“I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,” Trump said. “I couldn’t care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they’re going to buy American cars.”\n\nTrump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports.\n\nThe Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25 percent tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20 percent tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25 percent on all imports.\n\nSome aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump “respect.”\n\nWhat could tariffs do to the U.S. economy?\n\nNothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more.\n\nEconomist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent, down from a rate of 2.4 percent at the end of last year.\n\nREAD MORE: Tariffs on lumber, appliances set stage for higher costs on new homes and remodeling projects\n\nMayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro told “Fox News Sunday” that the auto tariffs would raise $100 billion annually and the other tariffs would bring in about $600 billion per year, or about $6 trillion over 10 years. As a share of the economy, that would be the largest tax increase since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent’s conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy.\n\n“There is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,” said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. “Auto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation.”\n\nHow are other nations thinking about the new tariffs?\n\nMost foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump’s tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were “not coherent” and would mean “breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It’s not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies.” Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country.\n\nThe Chinese government said Trump’s tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump.\n\n“There are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country’s development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nHow did Trump land on it being called ‘Liberation Day’?\n\nBased off Trump’s public statements, April 2 is at least the third “liberation day” that he has identified.\n\nAt a rally last year in Nevada, he said the day of the presidential election, Nov. 5, would be “Liberation Day in America.” He later gave his inauguration the same label, declaring in his address: “For American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.”\n\nHis repeated designation of the term is a sign of just how much importance Trump places on tariffs, an obsession of his since the 1980s. Dozens of other countries recognize their own form of liberation days to recognize events such as overcoming Nazi Germany or the end of a previous political regime deemed oppressive.\n\nTrump sees his tariffs as providing national redemption, but the slumping consumer confidence and stock market indicate that much of the public believes the U.S. economy will pay the price for his ambitions.\n\n“I don’t see anything positive about Liberation Day,” said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “It’s going to hurt the U.S. economy. Other countries are going to retaliate.”\n\nFind more coverage",

        "content": "LIVE RESULTS: Wisconsin Supreme Court special election\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tuesday’s special elections to replace Florida’s Republican former U.S. Reps. Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz will be held in two of the state’s GOP strongholds, but Democrats hope that strong fundraising in both districts is an indicator the races will be more competitive than they were in the last election just five months ago.\n\nControl of the U.S. House is not at stake, but the outcome of the special elections could give congressional Republicans some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. Republicans hold 218 seats, the minimum needed for a majority in a fully seated House. Democrats hold 213 seats, with two additional vacant seats most recently held by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, Republican Jimmy Patronis and Democrat Gay Valimont are running to replace Gaetz. Patronis is the state’s chief financial officer. He received President Donald Trump’s endorsement in the crowded 10-person primary. Valimont is a gun control activist. She challenged Gaetz for the seat in November and received 34 percent of the vote.\n\nREAD MORE: What to expect in Florida’s special congressional primaries\n\nIn Waltz’s old 6th Congressional District, the candidates are Republican state Sen. Randy Fine and Democrat Josh Weil, a public school educator in Osceola County. Fine represents a Brevard County-based state Senate district located outside the boundaries of the Palm Coast-area U.S. House seat he hopes to fill. He won three-way primary on Jan. 28 with Trump’s endorsement.\n\nThe 1st Congressional District borders Alabama on the Gulf Coast in the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle. It is home to both Naval Air Station Pensacola and Eglin Air Force Base. The district is among the most reliably Republican areas of the state. Trump received about 68 percent of the district vote in 2024, slightly outperforming the 66 percent Gaetz received in his reelection bid.\n\nThe four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties. Escambia is the least Republican in comparison, although Trump and Gaetz still received 59 percent and 57 percent of the county vote, respectively.\n\nOn the other side of the state, the 6th Congressional District sits on the Atlantic Coast and includes Daytona Beach. Republican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the district for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn’t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 key findings from the House Ethics report on Matt Gaetz misconduct allegations\n\nTrump carried the district in 2024 with 65 percent of the vote. Waltz received about 67 percent of the vote in his final House reelection bid. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74 percent of the vote. Their worst county in comparison was Volusia, where Trump received 58 percent and Waltz received about 60 percent. Waltz slightly outperformed Trump in every county in the district.\n\nGaetz resigned from Congress after Trump nominated him to be attorney general, but he later withdrew from consideration following ongoing scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking probe and a House Ethics Committee investigation.\n\nWaltz resigned in January to become White House national security adviser. This week, Washington was roiled by the news that Waltz had added a journalist to a Signal app group chat discussing military plans. Waltz, according to The Atlantic, appeared to have mistakenly added the journalist to a chat that included 18 senior Trump administration officials discussing planning for a strike in Yemen, but many Republicans going to the polls to replace Waltz have brushed off the story.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nREAD MORE: Florida Republicans defied DeSantis over an immigration bill. Is his grip on state lawmakers loosening?\n\nMachine recounts in Florida are automatic if the vote margin is 0.5 percent of the total vote or less. If the machine recount results in a vote margin of 0.25 percent of the total vote or less, a manual recount of overvotes and undervotes is required. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday.\n\nSpecial election day\n\nThe special elections in Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time, which is 7 p.m. ET in the 6th District and 8 p.m. ET in the 1st District.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in the 1st and 6th Congressional District special elections. Special primaries for state Senate and state House will also be on the ballot in some parts of Florida, but the AP will not be tabulating those contests.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAny voters registered in the 1st and 6th Congressional Districts may vote in the special election in their district.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of March 3, Florida’s 1st Congressional District had nearly 566,000 active registered voters, about 55 percent Republicans and 21 percent Democrats. The 6th District had about 559,000 active registered voters, about 49 percent Republicans and 26 percent Democrats.\n\nTurnout in the Jan. 28 special congressional primaries was about 17 percent of registered Republicans in the 1st District and about 15 percent in the 6th District. Democrats did not have competitive primaries in those districts.\n\nVoter participation tends to be much higher in presidential general elections than in elections held at other times. In the 2024 general election, turnout was about 76 percent of registered voters in the 1st District and about 80 percent in the 6th District.\n\nAbout 73 percent of voters from counties that make up the 1st and 6th Districts cast their ballots before Election Day in the 2024 general election. In the 2022 general election, about 56 percent of voters from counties included in the 1st District voted before Election Day, compared with about 60 percent for voters from counties in the 6th District.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, about 53,000 ballots had been cast in the 1st District, about 52 percent from Republicans and about 35% from Democrats. In the 6th district, nearly 71,000 had been cast, about 45 percent from Republicans and 40 percent from Democrats.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2024 general election, the AP first reported results in the 6th Congressional District at 7 p.m. ET, just as polls closed. The last vote update of the night was at 11:48 p.m. ET, with about 99 percent of the vote counted. In the 1st Congressional District, the first batch of votes was reported at 8:01 p.m. ET, or one minute after polls closed. The election night tabulation in the 1st District ended at 1:33 a.m. ET with about 99 percent of total votes counted.\n\nIn the Jan. 28 special primaries, the first results in the 6th District posted at 7:02 p.m. ET. The final update of the night was available at 8:38 p.m. ET with more than 99 percent of the vote reporting. In the 1st District, the AP’s first vote results posted at 8 p.m. ET, with more that 99 percent of the vote reported by the time vote tabulation concluded for the night at 10:16 p.m. ET.\n\n— Robert Yoon, Associated Press",

The notices come just days after President Donald Trump moved to strip workers of their collective bargaining rights at HHS and other agencies throughout the government.\n\nREAD MORE: HHS makes $25,000 buyout offer to most of its workers as Trump administration continues cuts\n\nAt the National Institutes of Health, the world’s leading health and medical agency, the layoffs occurred as its new director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, began his first day of work.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan last week to remake the department, which, through its agencies, is responsible for tracking health trends and disease outbreaks, conducting and funding medical research, and monitoring the safety of food and medicine, as well as for administering health insurance programs for nearly half of the country.\n\nThe plan would consolidate agencies that oversee billions of dollars for addiction services and community health centers under a new office called the Administration for a Healthy America.\n\nThe layoffs are expected to shrink HHS to 62,000 positions, lopping off nearly a quarter of its staff — 10,000 jobs through layoffs and another 10,000 workers who took early retirement and voluntary separation offers.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington predicted the cuts will have ramifications when natural disasters strike or infectious diseases, like the ongoing measles outbreak, spread.\n\n“They may as well be renaming it the Department of Disease because their plan is putting lives in serious jeopardy,” Murray said Friday.\n\nBeyond layoffs at federal health agencies, cuts are beginning to happen at state and local health departments as a result of an HHS move last week to pull back more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related money. Local and state health officials are still assessing the impact, but some health departments have already identified hundreds of jobs that stand to be eliminated because of lost money, “some of them overnight, some of them are already gone,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nUnion representatives for HHS employees received a notice Thursday that 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be terminated. The department’s leadership will target positions in human resources, procurement, finance and information technology. Positions in “high cost regions” or that have been deemed “redundant” will be the focus of the layoffs.\n\nKennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient “sprawling bureaucracy” in a video Thursday announcing the restructuring. He said the department’s $1.7 trillion yearly budget, “has failed to improve the health of Americans.”\n\n“I want to promise you now that we’re going to do more with less,” Kennedy said.\n\nThe department on Thursday provided a breakdown of some of the cuts.\n\n3,500 jobs at the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects and sets safety standards for medications, medical devices and foods.\n\n2,400 jobs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors for infectious disease outbreaks and works with public health agencies nationwide.\n\n1,200 jobs at the NIH.\n\n300 jobs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Affordable Care Act marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAt the CDC, most employees have not been unionized, but interest rose sharply this year as the Trump administration took steps to reduce the federal workforce. Roughly 2,000 CDC employees in Atlanta belonged to the American Federation of Government Employees local bargaining unit, with hundreds more who had petitioned to join in recent days being added.\n\nBut on Thursday night, Trump signed an executive order that would end collective bargaining for a large number of federal agencies, including the CDC and other health agencies.\n\nThe erosion of collective bargaining rights was decried by some Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“President Trump’s brazen attempt to strip the majority of federal employees of their union rights robs these workers of their hard-fought protections,” Reps. Gerald Connolly and Bobby Scott, both of Virginia, said in a joint statement Friday.\n\n“This will only give Elon Musk more power to dismantle the people’s government with as little resistance from dedicated civil servants as possible — further weakening the federal government’s ability to serve the American people.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Amanda Seitz and Matthew Perrone in Washington and Mike Stobbe in New York contributed.

It's a one-two punch of turbulent weather after deadly thunderstorms barreled across the nation this weekend, killing at least five people in Oklahoma, Indiana, and Michigan. Three of the deaths, all in Michigan, were children.\n\nThe Great Lakes also saw a much different type of storm, freezing rain. Crews worked today to clean up down trees and power lines that had taken out electricity for nearly half-a-million customers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.\n\nOn Wall Street, stock seesawed today before finishing mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded to gain 1 percent today, while the Nasdaq dropped by a meager 24 points. The S&P 500 also bounced back from sharp losses early in the day to finish slightly up.\n\nAnd speaking publicly for the first time since returning from their unexpectedly long stay in space, astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore said they would fly again aboard the Boeing spacecraft that could not bring them home last year.",

Now, what we have known in this Trump era is that in lower turnout elections, which a state Supreme Court race in April normally is, Democrats tend to have an advantage now. And that is because the Democratic base voter tends to be older, they tend to be higher educated, more affluent.\n\nThose are voters who show up in election after election. Trump's core base are people that don't always show up in off-year elections. They show up in presidential elections. So this is a really big test to see if the Trump coalition is actually going to turn out.\n\nAnd Elon Musk is spending a lot of money doing just that, arguing that they can actually get those people who normally aren't paying much attention to politics without Donald Trump off of the couch and into the voting place.",

        "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s celebrity astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their space sprint-turned-marathon and would fly on Boeing’s Starliner again.\n\nSpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing that returned to Earth without them last year.\n\nIn their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.\n\nWATCH: NASA astronauts who spent 9 months in space make splashdown in return to Earth\n\nWilmore didn’t shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing’s bungled test flight.\n\n“I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”\n\nBoth astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we’re going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We’re going to fix them. We’re going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he’d go back up “in a heartbeat.”\n\nWilliams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.\n\nThe longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space — 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5. The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.\n\nWATCH: Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on their longer-than-expected stay in space\n\nTheir space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged SpaceX’s Elon Musk to hurry things up, adding politics to the stuck astronauts’ ordeal. The dragged-out drama finally ended March 18 with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.\n\nNASA said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go,” Wilmore said.\n\nThe space agency may require another test flight — with cargo — before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year’s end.\n\nDespite Starliner’s rocky road, NASA officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing U.S. companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs.",

        "content": "LIVE RESULTS: Florida special elections to replace Gaetz and Waltz\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Wisconsin’s spring election on Tuesday for state Supreme Court, state schools chief and a proposed constitutional amendment requiring photo ID for voting will be the first major indication of the state’s political climate since Republican Donald Trump recaptured the White House in November.\n\nTrump edged Democrat Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by just 0.86 percentage points, the tightest margin of any state. That narrow win, as well as a highly competitive 2023 state Supreme Court contest, could foreshadow the possible paths to victory for this year’s statewide campaigns.\n\nREAD MORE: What you need to know about Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race\n\nIn the state Supreme Court race, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel look to replace outgoing Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, the court’s longest-serving member, who announced last April that she would not seek a fourth 10-year term. Wisconsin Supreme Court seats are officially nonpartisan, but voters as well as the state’s party establishments routinely rally behind certain candidates based on their judicial philosophies and records.\n\nCrawford has the backing of Democrats and progressives, including an endorsement this week from former President Barack Obama. Schimel has support from Republicans and conservatives, including endorsements from Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nLiberal-leaning justices gained a 4-3 majority on the court in 2023 for the first time in 15 years after Justice Janet Protasiewicz defeated former Justice Dan Kelly for a seat previously held by a conservative jurist. Bradley’s retirement gives conservatives an opportunity to retake the majority ahead of high-profile cases on abortion, unions and voting rights.\n\nAt the top of Tuesday’s ballot is the race for state superintendent of public instruction, the position responsible for managing Wisconsin’s 900,000-student, $9 billion public school system. Incumbent Jill Underly seeks a second four-year term against Brittany Kinser, an education consultant and founder of a state literacy initiative. While that role is also nonpartisan, Underly has the backing of the state Democratic Party and the state teachers’ unions, while Kinser is backed by the state Republican Party.\n\nUnderly placed first in the Feb. 18 top-two primary with about 38 percent of the vote, followed by Kinser with about 34 percent. Another candidate with support mostly from Democrats placed third with about 27 percent, not enough to advance to Tuesday’s general election. Underly was first elected in 2021 with 58 percent of the vote against Republican-backed candidate Deborah Kerr.\n\nIn any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison), while Republicans win by wide margins in the smaller, more rural counties that stretch across most of the state. Republican candidates also tend to rely on strong showings in the WOW counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington in suburban Milwaukee, which help counter Democratic advantages in urban areas. Victory is determined by how big those margins are in the respective party strongholds, as well as which side can win over the state’s more competitive swing areas.\n\nIn 2024, Harris, who was then vice president, won Milwaukee with 68 percent of the vote and Dane with 75 percent, while narrowly losing statewide. In comparison, Protasiewicz in her 2023 court race received 73 percent of the vote in Milwaukee and 82 percent of the vote in Dane. She went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin.\n\nProtasiewicz also won over about a dozen counties favorable to Trump, most notably in Brown County, home of Green Bay, which Trump carried in all three of his White House campaigns.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nRecounts are not automatic in Wisconsin, but a trailing candidate may request one if the winning vote margin is less than a percentage point. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect Tuesday.\n\nSpring election day\n\nThe Wisconsin Spring Election will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners for state Supreme Court, state superintendent of public instruction and the statewide ballot measure. Besides the statewide contests on the ballot, various local jurisdictions will also hold elections on Tuesday, but the AP will not be tabulating those contests.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAny registered voter in Wisconsin may participate in the election on Tuesday.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of March 1, there were more than 3.8 million active registered voters in Wisconsin. Voters in the state do not register by party.\n\nAbout 1.8 million votes were cast in the 2023 spring election for state Supreme Court. That was 51 percent of registered voters and roughly 40 percent of the voting age population at the time. About 25 percent of voters cast their ballots before Election Day. As of Thursday, more than 475,000 ballots had been cast before Election Day.\n\nIn the Feb. 18 primary, nearly 469,000 voters cast ballots in the race for superintendent, which was 12 percent of registered voters and roughly 10 percent of the voting age population at the time.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nThe AP first reported results in the Feb. 18 primary at 9:04 p.m. ET, or about four minutes after polls closed. In both the 2023 spring election and the 2024 presidential election, the first results of the night posted at 9:11 p.m. ET. Election night tabulation ended at 12:02 a.m. ET in the Feb. 18 primary, at 2:30 a.m. ET in the 2023 spring election and at 5:47 a.m. ET in the November general election, all with more than 98 percent of the total vote counted.\n\n— Robert Yoon, Associated Press",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Senator John Fetterman, occasional Democrat of Pennsylvania, has been very big on the Dems in Disarray circuit, arguing that the president’s narrow victory in 2024 was really a landslide in disguise. From the Financial Times:\n\n“Some of the most extreme voices now are coming from the far-blue places that are removed from the real fight—and that’s down in the important states that decide who’s going to win the White House,” he said. Simply obstructing Republicans at every turn would be a “political loser” with average Americans, he added, impeding Democrats’ ability to defeat the Republicans in 2028. “The last time we were yelling and screaming and demanding new leadership, how did it work out?” he asked, referring to Biden’s removal. “Maybe we should just realize where we are and try to figure out a way forward—rather than just reacting.”\n\nTo be fair, Fetterman of late has been loud in his denunciations of Elon Musk and DOGE. Maybe he should get in touch with these constituents, too. From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:\n\nAgents from the Mount Pleasant office arrived at the scene shortly after the body of Joseph Guzzo Jr. had been pulled from under the massive chunk of earth that collapsed in the mine tunnel four years ago. Then, months after launching an investigation that found the operator failed to provide critical protections, it happened again. Another worker in a mine just an hour away suffered catastrophic injuries after a large rock broke from a wall and slammed him against a machine.\n\nAgents from the Mine Safety and Health Administration office carried out an inquiry once again and found the operator failed to detect the breakdowns in the wall that led to its collapse. Year after year, investigators from the Mount Pleasant office—the most active mine safety center in the nation—launched inquiries into deaths and devastating injuries in some of the largest underground mines in the country.\n\nGod’s work, if anything is. Of course, Musk’s Cargo Shorts Militia finds most of God’s work to be ... inefficient.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to slash spending, the Department of Government Efficiency has targeted the mining agency in a move that surprised local inspectors and raised questions about the future of federal regulation in one of the country’s most dangerous jobs. “Without the federal inspections, coal operations will just run rampant,” said Tony Oppegard, a former Kentucky mine safety prosecutor and MSHA legal adviser. “There won’t be any accountability.” It’s not clear if the inspectors at the local office and others will be transferred or lose their jobs, but the cancelling of the leases comes as the number of injured workers has been increasing in some of the most active mines in the U.S., the Post-Gazette has found.\n\nIt seems almost preposterous to have to argue that mine-safety regulations ought to be some of the most stringent—if not draconian—in all of federal law. Hell, this was an issue that prompted the largest armed labor hostilities in this country. That the DOGE and pony show is blindly rolling back the enforcement capacity in this area is making these people at risk for what is tantamount to negligent homicide.\n\nThe move by the new agency is the latest in a series of actions by federal officials that have raised alarms among safety advocates, who have long pushed for greater safeguards in mining. After years of medical experts warning about a new form of black lung disease caused by an insidious toxin—silica dust—federal regulators created a rule that would force coal operators to drastically reduce exposure levels underground. The protection, which cuts in half the amount of silica allowed in the air, is set to take effect next month, but is now under legal challenges by trade groups and allies in Congress who are threatening to roll it back under the new administration.\n\n“It’s a struggle,” said Jimmy Phillips, a retired West Virginia miner who was diagnosed with black lung a decade ago. “It feels like someone put an elephant on your chest after you go a little ways.” Year after year, he and others suffering from the disease travel to the Bluestone Health Association clinic in Princeton, W.Va.—some strapped to oxygen tanks or carrying inhalers. There, they get breathing treatments, medication and other care for an illness that has no cure. Though the clinic is funded partially through federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, safety advocates say they’re concerned the money could be reduced or end under the new administration.\n\nThe lung disease caused by silica dust is even more crippling, and more lethal, than the more familiar “black lung” caused by inhaling coal dust.\n\nAnother visitor, Randall Dickerson, 49, is like so many others: The simple tasks of life are often insurmountable. “For me to walk 100 feet—it’s tough,” said the married father of three. “I wake up in the morning, I’m coughing my brains out. I have to use an inhaler and an oxygen machine, and I’m not even 50. That should never happen at my age.” When the illness is caused by silica—fine crystals that are more dangerous than coal dust—the chances of survival grow even more grim, experts say. “It’s like pieces of glass eating into your lungs,” said Amanda Lawson, a Bluestone benefits counselor who works with her mother, Ms. Johnson, at the center.\n\nGod’s work, all of them.",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "Every now and again, we check in with the folks at Just Security who are keeping track of the lawsuits currently active against the maladministration of the new American Golden Age. The current tally is 139 and, one suspects, climbing. Many of them make the heretofore unremarkable point that executive orders are in no way laws but, rather, policy recommendations from the executive designed to create a legislative agenda upon which Congress then would act.\n\n(Voice-over: That’s not how it works anymore.)\n\nAt the moment, of course, the administration’s record in the various courts is roughly equivalent to Germany’s in world wars. Which gave Speaker Moses an idea. From Reuters:\n\nJohnson, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters the numerous injunctions issued by judges nationally that have stymied Trump’s initiatives were part of a “dangerous trend. ... It violates separation of powers when a judge thinks that they can enjoin something that a president is doing, that the American people voted for,” Johnson said during his weekly press conference. He said the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing next week “to highlight these abuses” and had recently advanced legislation that would prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions blocking policies. “We do have authority over the federal courts,” he said. “As you know, we can eliminate an entire district court. We have power over funding, over the courts and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.”\n\nNice independent judiciary you have there. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n(Here is where I note that Speaker Moses seems unbothered by the one-man All U Can Sue wing-nut buffet being run by ol’ Judge Matt Kacsmaryk down in Amarillo.)\n\nJohnson seems prepared to give the contract over to his favorite button man, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Van Heusen), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Any judge subpoenaed by this collection of pantomime kangaroos should refuse to honor them and, if anyone threatens them, say they’ll honor Jordan’s subpoenas when he honors the January 6 select committee’s.

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Ordinarily, I stay away from the continuing forensic analysis of What the Fck Happened? The election was four months ago. The consequences are drowning us, and it’s hard enough keeping up with the fresh hell unleashed every day to go back and discuss how we all got here. However, in The New York Times on Tuesday, pollster named David Shor, and eventually they came around to a conclusion to which Shor had come from his polling. It is one of the most depressing pieces of dialogue I’ve read in a while.\n\nKLEIN: One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. This is something I was told by top Biden strategists. I don’t see democracy on here or Jan. 6 and the stability of the system. Did you test those, as well?\n\nSHOR: We did. But we did a survey where we just asked people: What’s more important right now—preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives? It was 78 to 18: delivering change that improves people’s lives. One of the hardest things about being a political consultant over the last eight years is that every day Trump does terrible things—things that I think are objectively awful and scary and that [expletive] me off. Things he says, like: I’m going to prosecute my enemies. Then we do a bunch of tests, and voters really don’t want to hear about it from us. I think Trump would do better if he didn’t say those things, for sure. But voters want politicians to talk about concrete ways that they are going to improve people’s lives.\n\nAll my life, it was a given that the more democratic a system was, the better off the people would be. Hell, that was the stated reason for almost all our military and intelligence misadventures of the past 80 years. Both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson proposed economic aid for Vietnam even as they deepened American military involvement in the hopes of stimulating some sort of democratic government in Indochina. (See also: The Quiet American.) It was the stated reason for the grandiose Middle East fantasies of the PNAC crowd during the aughts. When was it that the country stopped believing that? When did we decide, en masse, that democracy and “improving people’s lives” contradicted each other? Personally, I trace it back to Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural address, which supercharged the conservative dogma that “government” was somehow an alien entity and not the creation of a commonwealth in which we all had a stake and to which we had an obligation.\n\nRegulars here at the shebeen know that I am fond of Daniel Webster’s caution against simplifying government.\n\nNothing is more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many qualified rights.\n\nThe stake we all have in a political commonwealth, and to which we have obligations, can be found in those words. In the chat between Klein and Shor can be found the death of that commonwealth. Everything else is a symptom.",

        "content": "He means it. Make no mistake about that. Above all, don’t laugh it off. From NBC:\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump said, when asked to clarify. “But I’m not—it is far too early to think about it.” When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nI felt all along that, if the Supreme Court had allowed Colorado and other states to boot him off the ballot in 2024 under the 14th Amendment’s anti-insurrection clause, as it should have, Trump would have run anyway. And if he’d not won the Republican nomination, he’d have shown sufficient strength to make that nomination worthless to Nikki Haley or whoever got it. He’d have puddle-jumped the country for his ego-feeding rallies and rendered the entire process a perilous farce. And, who knows, he might have done well enough to throw the whole thing into the House of Representatives and won anyway. Nobody in the Republican House majority was going to stop him. And the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the Supreme Court would have been completely up for grabs.\n\nFrankly, I don’t see why he wouldn’t try this in 2028. Even if the court grows a new and permanent backbone and rules that he is ineligible, there’s nothing to stop him from running on his own hook. There’s no Republican politician out there with the stones to take him on in as public a forum as a presidential campaign. The party structure has proven worse than useless against him. His base would love him even more because he once again was thumbing his nose at the Deep State—and a big chunk of it already doesn’t trust Chief Justice John Roberts and actively hates Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nHe still has his plane and enough people out there in the country willing to host his gatherings of the rubes. Plus, even with the court’s preposterous immunity ruling, he’s still in at least some danger of ending his life in jail. And that’s just for what he did in his first term. (If the House flips to the Democrats in 2026, the path would become a little more difficult. But remember: If a presidential election reaches the House, each state gets one vote and, obviously, Republicans can still lose their majority and still have majorities in a majority of the state delegations.)\n\nI have no doubt that some of Trump’s lawyers from the firm of Lickspittle and Doormat are scheming away already. There’s nobody around him these days with the patriotism God gave a goose—nobody to say no to his lunatic strategies. He’s not joking. He doesn’t have that kind of wit.",

There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nThere is an angry talking yam loose in Our Nation’s Capital, and we all ought to be calling our congresscritters to tell them not to go out without armed guards and huge amounts of anti-yam repellent. On Thursday, it was reported that the Department of Defense would be briefing a certain unelected ketamine proponent on the country’s secret war plans for a possible conflict with China. The angry talking yam began storming around Pennsylvania Avenue, eating its own liver.\n\nElon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War, according to the Failing New York Times, one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China, that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and ‘spill the beans.’ RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story, which is probably libelous, and went heavy with it. Fortunately, nobody was watching!\n\nMaggot Hagerman, the really dumb ‘scammer’ who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who I haven’t spoken to in ages, is a big part of the Scam. She lead the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, only to realize that she was duped and got it wrong. She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting. The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE…And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\n\nYou may be comforted by the fact that “Elon” indeed will not be briefed by “the Department of War,” which we haven’t had since 1947. And, anyway, Henry Knox has been dead since 1806 and is therefore unavailable for private briefings. The vulgar talking yam continues to stalk the Beltway, howling in all caps until hell won’t even have it.\n\nOver at the White House, they’ve appointed a new liaison to NASA, which once represented all that was smart and good—and, in all honesty, white—about America. His name is Darren Bossie, and he worked for the first iteration of the West Wing of Hell. He is a young man of vast experience, as The New Yorker pointed out.\n\nDarren Bossie, the new White House liaison to NASA, arrived shortly after Trump’s Inauguration. Bossie was more or less unknown at the agency, but employees soon found his LinkedIn profile. He had spent four of the past seven years bouncing around conservative politics, with a stint as Trump’s White House liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and had worked as a senior consultant for unnamed companies. For the bulk of his professional life, however—from 2006 to 2018—he had been an assistant manager at a Total Wine & More in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\n“That didn’t seem very promising,” a senior NASA official told me.\n\nCan’t put anything past those guys.\n\nHowever, young Bossie prompted additional interest in those of us who have been tracking conservative ratfcking for a while.\n\nA review of public records, however, suggested that Darren is the brother of David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United—the conservative group whose litigation before the Supreme Court empowered mega-donors and corporations to make unlimited contributions to political candidates.\n\nBoy howdy has David Bossie left a long trail of fcked rats behind him. He made his bones with his infamous activities against candidate, and then president, Bill Clinton. David Bossie was the guy who forced his way into the hospital room where a woman was ministering to her husband who had suffered a stroke. The woman’s daughter, Susan Coleman, had committed suicide, and Bossie claimed to believe the hoax that Coleman had killed herself because Clinton had gotten her pregnant. Bossie’s tactics have managed to get him condemned by President George H.W. Bush, fired as a congressional investigator, and even marked lousy by the first Trump administration for profiteering off the president’s image. (That’s the president’s job, dammit.) However, he forever will be a conservative hero because he was one of the leaders of a political activist outfit called Citizens United, which was used to demolish any possibility of sensible political financial reform, perhaps forever. So we all have to deal with the Bossie family again because you can’t get away from Republican buccaneering even in outer space.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Empire State Express” (Son House): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from the Roaring (if goofy) Twenties, are some popular British party games. The “forfeit” of having to sit on a bottle while attempting to light a cigarette seems to be a lot harder than you’d think it was. Just hazarding a guess here that some gin was involved off camera. On the other hand, this looks like the original source material for Eyes Wide Shut. History is so cool.\n\nMy God, this is an historic first. From Washington Monthly:\n\nMaybe it’s time for J.D. Vance to face some questions. Vance’s favorability is worse than Harris’s at the same two-month mark and perhaps worse than any new vice president in the history of polling. His Real Clear Politics favorable-unfavorable rating is 41.7 percent-44.8 percent, a slightly worse net favorable rating (-3.1 percentage points) than Donald Trump’s (-0.9). When looking only at March polling—sampled after his infamous Oval Office hectoring of Ukraine’s president—he’s even more underwater: 42.4 percent-48.0 percent.\n\nThis is pure instinctive revulsion. Vance hasn’t really done anything yet except run his mouth, get booed at the Kennedy Center, and Be There, and that’s apparently been enough.\n\nA Vance ’28 campaign, I suspect, will be bogged down with immense baggage from his current stint in the public sector, without the ability to lean on any record of success in the private sector—save for a profitable book with a message that has no resemblance to anything Vance peddles today. If Trump taps a namesake to carry on his legacy, Vance will lose out on the party’s MAGA base.\n\nI think they’ve never trusted his naked ambition and, as the president appears to continue down the road of cognitive deterioration, he’s going to get blamed for every story out of the White House about how the president is headed for La La Land. Can’t say I blame the cult for this, either.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Popular Mechanics:\n\nArchaeologists excavating a private property in Florence, Italy, discovered a 20-inch statue of Hercules missing its head, though not altogether headless. Despite no cranium on the Greek hero, the statue included details from Hercules’ mythic 12 labors, including the skin of the Nemean lion and the severed head of the Cretan bull. The statue was dated to between the middle and late Imperial age from the third to fourth centuries, A.D., according to a translated report from Italian media, making it a roughly 1,700 find. The diminutive statue depicts a nude Hercules leaning to his right on his club, adorned with the trophies from his labors. According to Greek mythology, the Oracle of Delphi advised Hercules to travel to Tiryns to serve his cousin, King Eurystheus of Mycenae, for 12 years, for which he would be rewarded with immortality.\n\nAnd I guess, in one way, ol’ Herc was rewarded. All it cost was his head.\n\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nA new species of dinosaur found at a Mongolian building site has the largest fully preserved claw ever found. The bipedal, herbivorous animal had only two fingers on each hand, which it may have used to grasp branches and pull them towards its mouth. The 90-million-year-old fossil—which included parts of the pelvis, both arms and hands, and numerous vertebrae—was found near Khanbogd in the Gobi desert in 2012, but it has only now been properly studied and given the scientific name Duonychus tsogtbaatari. The genus name means “two claws” and the species name honours Mongolian palaeontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.\n\nThe researchers think the claws were an adaptation to grabbing and pulling down vegetation. With fewer fingers, each one could be stronger and more flexible, allowing for a tighter, more controlled grip, says Kobayashi. “The curved claws and extreme flexion suggest it could hook onto branches or clusters of leaves more easily,” he says. “Three fingers might have just gotten in the way, while two provided a more precise and efficient grasp.”\n\nGiant claws used merely to grab leaves? What a waste. I’m sure they can clean that up for the next movie. They lived, healthily and regularly, with plenty of roughage, to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in LA, now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

        "title": "Some Serious Russian Maritime Mischief Seems to Be Afoot",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Our friends, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists, have taken their act to sea these days, tracking some serious Russian maritime mischief in and around the Mediterranean—specifically, running guns to Libya and ferrying various types of contraband to various other places on ships of dubious provenance.\n\nThe documents show how commercial vessels—known as a ghost fleet—employed a range of tricks to avoid detection as they shipped Russian equipment to Libya. They also highlight growing European concerns about Russia’s influence in the country, which officials believed was part of a broader strategy by Moscow to project power in the Mediterranean and several African countries.\n\nAfter Isik posted the photographs, Interpol prepared a report on the Barbaros that found the vessel had manipulated its Automatic Identification System (AIS), the device that transmits information about a ship’s location, in an attempt to conceal its position. The report also found the ship had changed its name three times and had registered itself under the flag of a different country at least 10 times since 2013. The report assessed that the ship “may be carrying firearms destined for Libya” and recommended that authorities closely monitor it.\n\nThree name changes? Ten different flags? There are protected witnesses with less complicated CVs.\n\nRussia’s ghost fleet has enriched Moscow by helping it evade Western sanctions on its oil sales, according to the United States and European Union. Whether carrying oil or arms, these vessels often manipulate their AIS to avoid detection. In dozens of reports produced in 2024, European authorities tracked how vessels turned off their AIS when passing near the Syrian port of Tartus, where Russia maintains a naval base. Sometimes, these ships also spoofed their AIS data to appear in a different place than where they actually were. In another case, according to a report included in the leaked documents, a vessel suspected of shipping arms from Syria to Libya manipulated its location to appear offshore the Lebanese capital of Beirut—but mistakenly transmitted its location as on dry land at the airport, rather than the maritime port.\n\nThe Russians were a lot less clever when they were a bunch of broke Communists.\n\nTheir economy is a den of thieves. Their military is in shambles. They are ruled by a strongman who doesn’t even pretend to be anything but a kleptocrat any more and who seems perpetually to be one step ahead of a panicked flight to Bimini. Yet, despite all that, they still have the wherewithal to run an operation like this, and to sublet an American administration ... twice.\n\nAccording to a leaked briefing document, the head of the EU naval mission was advised in June that the number of Russian flights to Libya in the first half of 2024 matched the total for all of 2023, and that the mission had observed “a formalization of the Russian presence” over the past year. The document also described an increase of Russian military shipments to the country. “A Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean is a fact and we see regular navy visits to [Libya],” the briefing document stated. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company that had been operating in Libya since at least 2018, were supplanted in 2024 by the Africa Corps, a unit under the direct control of Russia’s military, the leaked documents reported.\n\nThe Africa Corps. Tobruk. This all seems familiar somehow.\n\nLibya represents “an immediate security issue for Europe” because of Russia’s presence there and the African nation’s role as a migration route, according to the internal summary following the meeting with the German envoy. “It’s a testament to Western strategic negligence,” said El Gomati, the Sadeq Institute director. “Russia has been constructing a military node that is not only capable of destabilizing Libya but also threatens European security 400 miles from NATO’s shores.”\n\nNegligence is doing a lot of work at having a kind meaning in that sentence.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Yes, folks. He’s nutty as the Christmas fruitcake. From The New York Times:\n\nInstead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News. He has repeated the idea in other interviews on the channel.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your latest dispatch from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd he’s not alone.\n\nMr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion. “There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.\n\nImmunologists are aghast.\n\n“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.\n\nShe has a gift for understatement.\n\nSince January 2022, there have been more than 1,600 outbreaks reported on farms and backyard flocks, occurring in every state. More than 166 million birds have been affected. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus, called H5N1, to evolve into a more virulent form. Geneticists have been tracking its mutations closely; so far, the virus has not developed the ability to spread among people. But if H5N1 were to be allowed to run through a flock of five million birds, “that’s literally five million chances for that virus to replicate or to mutate,” Dr. Hansen said.\n\nEvidently, Mr. Secretary thinks that he’s Walter Reed in Cuba, except using chickens and not human volunteers. The super-immune chickens will Tell Us Something.\n\nMr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said. “The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.” Public health regulations would forbid the very few birds that might survive an infection from being sold. In any event, those birds might only be protected against the current version of H5N1, not others that emerge as the virus continues to evolve. “The biology and the immunology doesn’t work that way,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with how we factory-raise our food, especially the animate foodstuffs. But it can only be solved through vigorous government regulation—which, as we know, gives President Musk the vapors, so much so that he's already screwed the pooch on this very thing, forcing the Department of Agriculture to bail out both him and the president he theoretically serves. So, for the moment, there ain't nobody here but us chickens.",

        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where it looks like nothing but rain.\n\nWe begin in Wisconsin, where we check in on the country’s most superheated state supreme court race and discover that a certain wealthy South African chain-saw enthusiast has decided to have his fun by perverting the democratic process one more time. From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nMusk took to X, the social media platform he owns, to announce Wednesday evening that “Scott A.” from Green Bay had won the sum for signing Musk’s “Petition in Opposition to Activist Judges.” The petition was announced late last week on the X account of Musk’s super PAC, America PAC. It offers $100 in cash to people who sign the election petition but does not mention a $1 million giveaway.\n\n“Crazy Elon ... his prices are ... INSANE!”\n\nThe $1 million giveaway was initially announced by America PAC, though the super PAC’s spending records make no mention of that payment. More than $2 million in independent expenditures in recent days have been for texting, field operations and canvassing.\n\nLet us once again thank Baal for the wisdom of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy who, when confronted with the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was moved to make this remark.\n\nWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. … The fact that speakers [editor’s note: i.e., donors] may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. … The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\nGood call, Anthony.\n\nAt issue in Wisconsin is the ideological balance of the state supreme court. Democrat Susan Crawford is being challenged by career wing nut Brad Schimel. The race is now the most expensive state judicial race in history, and have I mentioned recently what a terrible idea an elected judiciary is? A Schimel victory, and a conservative majority on the Wisconsin court, likely would re-gerrymander the state legislature.\n\nMusk wrote that the next award would be announced Friday. He has spent about $20 million backing conservative Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s election, when Schimel will go head-to-head against liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Musk’s spending has made him the single largest spender in the race that an election watchdog group has predicted could top a record-breaking $100 million in spending.\n\nCrawford’s campaign spokesman slammed Musk and Schimel over the payouts. “It turns out that Schimel is such a bad candidate that Elon Musk will spend whatever it takes to prop up Schimel’s failing campaign in a corrupt attempt to buy influence on the Supreme Court for his company’s lawsuit,” spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement, referencing the lawsuit by another Musk company, Tesla, against the State of Wisconsin. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary.”\n\nBut not “corrupt.” Ask Mr. Justice Kennedy.\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where another supreme court race continues to stagger on because the Republican candidate declines to accept defeat, choosing instead to challenge a huge number of ballots on what are apparently bogus grounds. Republican Jefferson Griffin lost to incumbent Democrat Allison Riggs by 734 votes. This result has been certified through two recounts. He now has gone to a court of appeals to argue that the election rules should be changed retroactively and thousands of votes be tossed out. The grounds are spurious at best; Griffin seeks to eliminate ballots cast by voters whose registrations lacked driver’s license or Social Security numbers even though neither was required at the time of the election.\n\nAs it happens, on Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, another critical voting-rights case, this one aimed at gutting section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is the last viable element of that landmark bill left functioning after the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the court got done with it. At issue was a court order mandating that Louisiana create a second majority-minority district. A good measure of section 2’s future is the fact that even the lawyers arguing Louisiana’s case told the court that they thought section 2 was unconstitutional but that they followed it anyway. Thanks, folks. However, the liberal justices, most notably Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noticed that one side seemed to be arguing that it could ignore an adverse ruling. As we know, there’s a lot of that going around. Jackson said:\n\nI mean, I ... am sort of concerned about your view—as seemingly expressed, and I want you to clarify it—that a court order compelling you to do something is not a good reason for you to do it.\n\nKagan, meanwhile, was struck by the fact that the people opposed to the new district kept getting beaten in court, only to come back for more.\n\nSo ... I get the idea that it did have the option to keep on finding ways to litigate this question, but ... there were ways that it could have refused to give up. I take that point. But at some point, it said ... we’ve been told we’re wrong by seven judges, and we’re going to accept that and we’re going to move on and find a map. And then the state lawyers come in and ... the record is the state lawyer says there can be no better reasons to believe that the VRA required a second majority Black district than a precedential opinion of the Fifth Circuit affirming that a map with a single majority Black district likely violated section 2. And the state lawyer talks about all the process that they went through and all—and hearing that they had and the maps that were submitted. And she says what better reason could there be for this?\n\nRepublicans simply do not lose elections. That is a hard and fast rule in American politics. They just run out the clock, and the clock never reaches zero.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Oyster Shucker Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of some ducks who seem to have a very good class action lawsuit. From KFOR:\n\nNine ducks are now recovering after diesel fuel leaked into a duck pond at the University of Oklahoma earlier this month. News 4 first reported on the ducks last week when residents voiced concerns about a strong chemical odor coming from the pond and an oily substance covering the ducks. The Department of Environmental Quality later told News 4 a power plant pump had malfunctioned, causing diesel to leak into the duck pond.\n\nOn Tuesday, News 4 learned that nine ducks were washed with a solution and are now undergoing waterproofing therapy in a special pool. While WildCare says the ducks do show signs of chemical burns, especially around the eyes, they currently don’t have any symptoms of gastrointestinal issues from swallowing the fuel. The ducks have been given medication that the organization hopes will reduce their chances of developing ulcers.\n\nSue ’em, boys. Get it while you can.\n\n\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Elise Stefanik Just Learned Firsthand What Happens When You Trust Trump",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nOh, Elise. How did this happen? It profit not a woman to gain the entire world and lose her soul, but for your old congressional seat? To paraphrase Eric Stratton, rush chairman of the Delta Tau Chi chapter at Faber College, hey, you fcked up. You trusted him. From NBC:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he was pulling the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing concerns about the House’s slim margin to enact his legislative agenda. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that Stefanik “will stay in Congress” after her nomination for the administration post had stalled for months.\n\n“I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People. Speaker Johnson is thrilled!”\n\nAs it happens, Speaker Moses is quaking in his loafers, His majority is paper-thin. He’s got special elections coming up in erstwhile safe Republican districts where the polling numbers are doing things they’ve rarely done before. (The district once represented by Mike Waltz, star of stage, screen, and group chats, is dangerously close.) And the internal polls must look like a cholera epidemic at this point, since the president is nervous enough to stab Stefanik in the back this way while giving the decision the old ALL CAPS hard sell on his failing social media platform. I wish I could say that Stefanik didn’t deserve to be treated like a doormat but, damn, did she deserve to be treated like a doormat.\n\nThe latest offense against history committed by the administration has to do with whitewashing the Smithsonian Institution. Vice President J Divan Vance has been tasked with bringing American history in line with the mandates of creating a white-supremacist nation of the mind again, drawn to the specifications of a tottering old grifter who never knew much history in the first place. From The New York Times:\n\nIn an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” Mr. Trump took aim at what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” His order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it promotes “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”\n\nIt’s long past time to treat these EOs as the policy suggestions that they are. This, of course, would require a far less supine Congress. How does the president plan to square these requirements with the missions of the National Museum of African American History and Culture or the National Museum of the American Indian or even parts of the Holocaust Memorial Museum? I’m almost afraid to ask.\n\nIn the order he called on Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.” His executive order also called for making sure that the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, does not “recognize men as women in any respect.”\n\nI am now sorry I asked.\n\nIn another passage of the order that could have sweeping implications, Mr. Trump directed the secretary of the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, to determine whether, since 2020, “public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history.” Instead, the order directs, all properties should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.”\n\nWelcome back, I suspect, all ye Traitors in Defense of Slavery. Time to rehearse all the lies of the Lost Cause that we learned in grade schools, North and South. Time for history to resume its role as a national anesthetic.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “A Foggy Day” (Germaine Bazzle): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1920, some French battle flags from the Franco–Prussian War are returned to the Army Museum in Paris. No sign of meddlesome politicians. History is so cool.\n\nThere were some interesting doings around the Supreme Court this past week. First, the Nine Wise Souls upheld the Biden Administration’s regulations on so-called ghost guns. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority. From SCOTUSBlog:\n\nCongress enacted the Gun Control Act, Gorsuch explained, because it found that then-current “gun control measures … allowed criminals to acquire largely untraceable guns too easily.” The act requires manufacturers to put a serial number on guns and regulates commercial gun sales by (among other things) requiring gun manufacturers and dealers to conduct background checks and keep records of gun sales. Advances in technology, Gorsuch noted, such as 3D printing and reinforced polymers, have changed the way in which guns are manufactured and sold. And in particular, “companies are able to make and sell weapon parts kits that individuals can assemble into functional firearms in their own homes.” These kits are popular among hobbyists, Gorsuch wrote, but also among criminals, because some manufacturers and sellers do not regard them as “firearms” subject to the Gun Control Act and therefore do not comply with the act’s requirements—leading to “an explosion of crimes” around the country.\n\nYou take your sunbeams where they fall these days, and it’s nice to see that the court draws the line at the free manufacture of untraceable firearms. In other action, the court refused to hear a challenge to the 1964 decision in Sullivan v. New York Times, the landmark First Amendment case that raised the standards for libel in connection with public figures—in this case, casino mogul Steve Wynn. From CBS News:\n\nWynn sued the AP in 2018 over its reporting about sexual misconduct allegations against him from the 1970s that were filed with law enforcement. He stepped down from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts, which he founded, in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal published sexual misconduct allegations. Wynn also stepped down from his role as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Wynn has consistently denied any allegations of misconduct.\n\nI’m not going to rest easily on this one. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch both are on record as favoring overturning Sullivan. The president wants to burn the decision on the White House steps. Steve Wynn may have been a singularly unattractive plaintiff. My chickens are going to remain uncounted on this one.\n\n\n\nFurther Adventures in Cowardice. From Politico:\n\nThe White House has reached a deal with one of the largest law firms in the world to provide the equivalent of $100 million in free legal work to causes supported by the administration, President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon. The law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, will also fund fellowships for law school graduates to work on causes in line with the administration’s priorities. The fellows “will represent a wide range of political views, including conservative ideals,” the president said in a statement.\n\nNo expert here, but $100 million seems a lot of money to pay for the right to take on ideological DEI cases. And the administration didn’t even have to threaten these jamokes. Jesus, these people.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From The New York Times:\n\nArchaeologists have unearthed the huge tomb of an unknown pharaoh at an Egyptian necropolis, a team of researchers said on Thursday, in the second discovery of a king’s tomb this year. ... Researchers uncovered the tomb at the mountain, at the base of a high desert cliff where strong winds carry gusts of sand. In some places around the necropolis, sand has buried structures more than 16 or 19 feet deep. The burial chamber features a decorated entryway, several rooms and soaring 16-foot vaults made of mud bricks. It dwarfs a tomb unearthed at Abydos over a decade ago, which was hailed at the time as the first material proof of a “lost” dynasty of kings there.\n\nAn unknown pharaoh, eh? An Egyptian Franklin Pierce. Every country should have one.\n\nHey, NBC News. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nDuonychus, which means “two claws” in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.\n\nThe standards for “an odd set of traits” are a lot higher for dinos than they are for, say, guppies or parakeets. If the scientists find the traits of this new species odd, you can bet that the beast is strange and wonderful.\n\n\n\n“It kind of blew my mind,” the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News by email. “I felt this rush of excitement, like, ‘Wait … am I actually looking at something completely new here?’ ” Therizinosaurs were already the “weirdest dinosaurs out there,” Kobayashi said. “Duonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It’s like evolution said, ‘Let’s try something different,’ and just ran with it.”\n\nThey lived then to make Dr. Kobayashi happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand, and by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "In our continuing effort to keep abreast of future conspiracy bait here in the shebeen, we call your attention to this tragedy in Virginia. From The Guardian:\n\nIn a statement on social media, Alexandria police announced that at about 9.18am on Saturday, police responded to the 900 block of Beverley Drive following reports of an unresponsive woman. Upon arriving at the scene, authorities located a deceased woman who they later identified as 43-year-old Jessica Aber. “In a matter of protocol, an investigation is under way surrounding the circumstances of her death. The office of the chief medical examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death,” police said, without providing additional details surrounding her death.\n\nAs is—or was, anyway—the case with U.S. attorneys, Ms. Aber, who resigned on the day of Trump’s inauguration, prosecuted a wide variety of dangerous criminals.\n\nAber began her career in 2009 at the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia where she prosecuted financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime, and child exploitation cases. From 2015 to 2016, she served on an assignment as counsel to the assistant attorney general from the justice department’s criminal division. From 2016 until becoming US attorney, Aber served as the deputy chief of the criminal division for the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the US attorney’s office said.\n\nThese miscreants included a rogues’ gallery of characters, some of whom had the requisite motivation and the (theoretical) wherewithal to revenge themselves against the prosecutor(s) who put them away. From USA Today:\n\nThis is a target-rich environment for exploitative yahoos from across the political spectrum. Remember Seth Rich and ignore them all. This is a big hunk of catnip to a Department of Justice that is MAGAfied to its very core. Don't believe a word they say. We have enough real, demonstrable atrocities to concern us.",

        "title": "In the War Room with Steve Bannon",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Keep your face always toward the sunshine, said old Walt Whitman, and shadows will fall behind you. So let’s take what we can get. This weekend, in blazing-red Louisiana, Governor Jeff Landry got his jewels kicked through the roof of his mouth. Landry threw his support behind four MAGA-friendly amendments to the state constitution, and all four of them lost. From the Louisiana Illuminator:\n\n\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box.\n\nLandry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and restricted annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks. The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily.\n\nIn Louisiana? Bad idea. Very damn bad idea.\n\nAmendment 3, which 66% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Vera Institute and Southern Poverty Law Center, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. Sarah Omojola, Louisiana director for the Vera Institute, said the results for Amendment 3 show voters are starting to reject incarceration as the sole option for criminal justice. She added that high incarceration rates have only served to destabilize communities rather than reduce crime. “In defeating Amendment 3, voters made clear their desire for the things that actually make our communities safer—like quality education and opportunity,” Omojola said in a statement.\n\nThat is a thoroughgoing ass-kicking—66 percent? zowie—and it is yet another example of conservative policies being far less popular than the people dreaming them up. This shutout was also an example of effective political branding and organization. A lot of people should take careful notes about what the people who beat these amendments have done.\n\nWhile those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. “[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank that helped push the tax and budget amendment.\n\n“No on all.” Simple, easily understood, and a more than decent rallying cry. It made for a fine bumper sticker too. And it tacitly recognizes that the assault on American institutions is a general threat that requires a general result.\n\n\n\nThe defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 65% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. Amendment 4 also failed, with 64% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nTurnout for the election was also higher than anticipated. There were no other statewide issues to decide, and only a limited number of local races. Projections called for 12% of state voters of cast ballots, but numbers from the Secretary of State placed turnout at 21%.\n\n“No on all” sounds like it might fit future judicial nominations right nicely, cher.\n\n",

        "content": "The fallout from the revelation by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic that he had been inadvertently “read into” a meeting on the Signal app at which the administration’s plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed continues to fall like sandbags in an old vaudeville routine. Government bouffe is all the rage in Beltway entertainment these days.\n\nThe Commonwealth’s (God save it!) daily communicant at the Church of the Perpetually Ambitious, Rep. Seth Moulton, waxed profound:\n\nThere is no world in which this information should have been shared in non-secure channels.\n\nSenator Professor Warren had questions:\n\nOur national security is in the hands of complete amateurs. What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?\n\nFormer Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was moved to discreet profanity:\n\nFrom an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of f‑‑‑up imaginable. To see this administration claiming that it cares about competence and merit and then be responsible for an epic f‑‑‑up like this demonstrates that these are not serious people. ... This kind of intelligence failure calls the question on whether there is any place for merit or competence in this administration at all. Because if there are not highly serious consequences for this level of screwup, then it will make clear that all of the bluster about merit that you hear about from this White House is just bullshit. We deserve so much better than this.\n\nAnd Hillary Rodham Clinton was moved to succinctness:\n\nYou have got to be kidding me.\n\nIn the face of all this criticism, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff sober, responded in fluent FoxSpeak, that strange dialect understood by angry shut-ins all over America.\n\nSo you’re talking about a Deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the, I don’t know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax. So this is the guy that peddles in garbage. This is what he does. I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign. Because of the skill and courage of our troops, I’ve monitored it very closely from the beginning, and you see, we’ve been managing 4 years of deferred maintenance under the Trump administration. Our troops, our sailors were getting shot at as targets. Our ships couldn’t sail through. And when they did shoot back, it was purely defensively or at shacks in Yemen. President Trump said no more. We will reestablish deterrence. We will open freedom of navigation. And we will ultimately decimate the Houthis, which is exactly what we’re doing as we speak from the beginning overwhelmingly details.\n\nI feel safe in my assumption that Secretary Hegseth wouldn’t know Jeffrey Goldberg if he sat in his lap. So what we got from the secretary as regards one of the most hilariously obvious exercises in incompetence was a tangle of Trumpian conjuring words designed to make all the scandals disappear. And some tough-guy posturing that was effective on the couch with Harris Faulkner but that is Punch-and-Judy bafflegab in the real world.\n\nAnd the president?\n\nI don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business.\n\nWhere are the clowns?\n\nDon’t bother. They’re here.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "By happy accident, or by the intervention of a giddy Deity, on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee had scheduled its annual national threat assessment hearing. This brought before the committee Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI director Kash Patel, CIA director John Ratcliffe, and a couple of other members of the intelligence community one day after it was revealed that the editor of The Atlantic had been invited to a group chat with most of these people regarding the imminent attack by the United States on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It surely comes as no surprise that the tap-dancing from the witness table was something unseen on TV since the last time TCM ran Singin' In The Rain.\n\nThe general subtext of the testimony was a not-subtle attempt to shift the blame to people who weren't there—to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and even to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Meanwhile, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were parboiled by Democratic senators as they first tried to dodge the fact that they were on the group chat and, when called on that, they either claimed that there was nothing classified discussed on the chat, or that they couldn't talk about certain subjects because they were, well, classified. Ratcliffe had a particularly hard time; for a CIA director, he didn't seem to have much to do with intelligence, in any sense of the word. First, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado lit him up.\n\nI am curious about whether... did Jeff Goldberg somehow—did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of this Signal thread? Please answer the question. Don't insult the intelligence of the American people. Did he invite himself to the signal thread?\n\nDir. Ratcliffe: I do not know how he was invited...\n\nThen, Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked Ratcliffe simply if the inclusion of Goldberg on the chat was a \"huge mistake.\" Ratcliffe went into a buck-and-wing, denying that the inclusion of the journalist was a \"huge mistake.\" Ossoff went into orbit.\n\nThat was not a huge mistake? They characterized it as an embarrassment. This is utterly unprofessional. There has been no apology. There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.\n\nThis thing is not over. Not by a long shot.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears that he’s been doing all this stuff sober, had a real bad Wednesday morning for himself. It followed a Tuesday Senate hearing in which the heads of the various intelligence branches tried to wriggle out from under the scandal regarding how the editor of The Atlantic was invited onto a chat concerning an imminent attack in Yemen. (Why are we killing people just to make the rubble bounce in Yemen? Good question.) His colleagues were quick to dive behind the excuse that no “war plans” were discussed on the chat, so what’s the big deal, dude? That alibi lasted less than a day. From the AP:\n\nIn the group chat, Hegseth posted multiple details about the impending strike, using military language and laying out when a “strike window” starts, where a “target terrorist” was located, the time elements around the attack and when various weapons and aircraft would be used in the strike. He mentioned that the U.S. was “currently clean” on operational security.\n\n“Godspeed to our Warriors,” he wrote.\n\n“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)” “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)” “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)” “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)” “1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”\n\nAnd now the punchline.\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nShortly after The Atlantic published these receipts, the same vaudeville troupe from the intelligence community appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. Their act got roughly the same reception from the committee’s Democratic minority as it did from the Senate a day earlier. Except, of course, the latest revelations from The Atlantic necessitated some adjustments to their routine. Now, since “war plans” were indeed discussed on the chat, their primary excuse was that nothing that was discussed was classified. Rep. Joaquin Castro was unconvinced by this latest improv. First up for Castro was NSA director General Timothy Haugh:\n\nCastro: “If your organization, your agency, intercepted something like this from Russia or China or some other country, would you consider this classified information?”\n\nHaugh: “We would classify based off of our sources and methods. It would be classified based off of our collection. Based off of the protection of our own source and method, not necessarily based off the content, but how we collected that information.”\n\nCastro: “But, it would be classified? ... If you did your job and collected it from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense and the President’s Chief Advisor—there is no way—no way, having sat on this committee for nine years, that somebody would come in with that information and give us something that says ‘unclassified—you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whomever you want.’ ”\n\nAfter finishing with Haugh, Castro turned his attention to director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe, both of them former colleagues of his in the House.\n\nCastro: “You know, with all respect—you and I worked on the committee at the same time. Tulsi, you and I came in together. We’ve never had, I’ve never had an issue or beef with you. John, you and I are both from Texas—y’all know that’s a lie. It’s a lie to the country.”\n\nIt’s clear that events are starting to shuffle Hegseth toward the door. His fate now completely depends on his president’s stubborn refusal ever to admit to a mistake. The same can be said to be true of so much of the country, which is beginning to wish this vaudeville show had closed out of town.",

The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. This is going to require some explaining.\n\nI would think so.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nWhew. Paranoia strikes deep. Sufficient to out current moment, of course. But one thing we can be sure of is that, if the administration did set up a Veritas-style ratfck, they were better-than-even money to screw it up. And one of the ways we know that is that the actual facts of this particular situation are a spectacular example of utter incompetence.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.” A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.” ...\n\n\n\n... The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nThe gob, it is smacked.\n\nThese guys organized a meeting to discuss a military strike and nobody thought to ask, “Gee, fellas, isn’t it kind of weird that we invited the editor of The Atlantic to this top-secret strategy conference?” Or nobody bothered to check the call list, and I guess we’re lucky they didn’t invite Oprah or Jim Cantore.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nDon’t just take his word for it.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe answer to the Stengel Question is, in this case, nobody.",

        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "content": "Sooner or later, probably when this administration looks around and sees that there is nothing left of the old republic to destroy, the foreign owners and the editors of Tiger Beat on the Potomac will stop being so goddamn fascinated by the techniques that it employed to do so. If there ever was going to be a final example of the dangers of value-free, nonjudgmental political reporting, it’s been the performance of America’s most prominent foreign-owned political tip sheet.\n\nMonday morning’s lead item was a perfect example. It was a bloodless examination of how well Elon Musk and Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought are working an “outside-inside” strategy to destroy the federal government.\n\nMusk, the impulsive Silicon Valley billionaire, provides the public face to the bureaucracy-slashing efforts and takes the heat for the budget-cratering, employee-firing, and overall havoc-wreaking that has been unleashed on the federal government. Vought, the conservative budget wonk, brings the expertise, insider knowledge, and ideology to a dramatic downsizing that both men see as necessary and transformational, four former Trump administration officials told POLITICO.\n\nIs “havoc-wreaking” a bad thing that ought to be deplored? Not their department, says Politico. And Vought was considered a fringe crackpot until he got the money to carry out his fantasies and the ear of a president who doesn’t know anything about anything. Now the richest man in the world and a career apparatchik, both in the employ of a grifter in chief and working with a congressional majority apparently assimilated into the ruling Borg, have managed to wreck the place with impunity. Again, I ask, is havoc-wreaking a bad thing? I always thought it was. But then again, I’m not a “former Trump administration official.” Fine sourcing there.\n\nOne of the former administration officials called Musk a “game changer” for Vought. Without Musk, “it would have been more confined to what OMB can do versus sending roving gangs of people to the agencies and doing, like, a hostile takeover,” the former official said.\n\nGreat. Bureaucratic thuggery in service of a shakedown and a “hostile takeover” of agencies that actually belong to all of us. Is this a bad thing? Not our department, says Politico.\n\nBut critics argue that approach has been sloppy, cruel, and chaotic, leaving many federal workers fearful of whether they’ll have a job when they show up to work the next morning and slashing budgets that they say provide necessary services. Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said that Musk’s “reign of chaos furthers much of what Vought desires” but doubted whether what he called their “marriage of convenience” would last.\n\n“Critics argue” whether the approach has been “sloppy” and “chaotic”? And some head of a non-profit you’ve never heard of thinks a Musk–Vought split is somehow inevitable. My God, you don’t have to be a “critic” to “argue” that there aren’t “tens of millions” of people over 100 receiving Social Security, or that firing 350 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, and then trying to hire them back only to find that nobody had thought to obtain their current contact information, was no way to run a government. And waiting for the Musk–Vought schism is not a tenable strategy for the survival of democratic government.\n\nNot their department, says Politico.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Goddamn, even this? From NPR:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms, and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump’s executive order on gender identity.\n\nSeveral federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes. A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, “FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26—Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.”\n\n“Equal Opportunity will not be considered...”\n\nGive my regards to 1954 and remember me to Orval Faubus. And the eye of Sauron descends on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, eventually, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nTo be clear, all businesses—those that have government contracts and those that do not—still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.\n\nFor now.\n\nOn this issue, especially, I do not want to hear anything from the anti-Trump Republicans. Almost from the time Lyndon Johnson handed Dr. King the pen with which h’d signed the CRA in 1964, the Republican Party determined to derive political benefits from attaching itself to the angry remnants of American apartheid. Almost to a person, our new allies made their careers within that context and, as best as I can recall, none of them raised a moral or political objection to the largely successful rollback of the achievements of the civil-rights movement. That is the singular moral failure at the heart of modern American conservatism.\n\n(LBJ saw it coming. And what he said to Bill Moyers is the gentler American equivalent of what Michael Collins said after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921: “I have signed my own death warrant.” They were both right.)\n\nElsewhere in the backward march of history, remember the great story of the Navajo Code Talkers, the Native soldiers who used their tribal language as an unbreakable code during World War II in the Pacific? (Made a pretty good movie, too, with Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach.) Well, apparently, it’s time to forget them again. From the Military Times:\n\nMany links that previously took viewers to informational articles about the Native American service members who used their native language as an indecipherable code to help win World War I and II were no longer accessible as of Tuesday afternoon. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department was working to rectify the situation.\n\nShut up. You got caught.\n\n“The department is restoring content about the Navajo Code Talkers,” the spokesperson said. “It had previously been removed during the auto-removal process.”\n\nSomebody had to program the auto-removal process, which means a decision was made to delete the Navajo material, probably along with the records of minority Medal of Honor winners. And we all have to admit now that LBJ pretty much low-balled that prediction.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "One of the regular tropes from our previous exercise in self-destruction that I kept handy was the fact that the claim that “we hire only the best people” never would stop being funny. Now that we’re deep into Hell’s Encore, it’s time to trot it out again, with the caveat that it isn’t as funny the second time around. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, have published papers claiming vaccines increase the risk of autism, a theory that has been studied for decades and scientifically debunked. David Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators more than a decade ago for practicing medicine without a license. He is listed as a data analyst in the HHS employee directory.\n\nThere is, of course, absolutely no need for any study of whether vaccines cause autism. They don’t. And if you need proof, there are only a couple hundreds studies debunking the whole notion you can look up. But if you’re going to form a committee to study a nonexistent medical phenomenon, who better than a non-doctor to head it up?\n\n“It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research. “They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly linked vaccines to autism. Kennedy has often cited studies by David Geier and his father, a physician, asserting that their research reveals the negative effects of vaccines. ...\n\n... During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) pressed Kennedy to publicly disavow his past claims about vaccines and autism. Kennedy replied he would do so if presented with data disproving the link, despite the overwhelming body of research that already does.\n\nOf course, Cassidy, a real doctor, voted for Kennedy’s nomination anyway, because Hippocrates never had to worry about a future primary.\n\nEntrusting the nation’s health to a notorious quack already is having nationwide consequences. The measles epidemic in west Texas rages on despite the fact that Kennedy’s Patent Medicine Wagon rolled into town weeks ago. From The New York Times:\n\nParents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus. One of those supplements is cod liver oil containing vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage. Some of them had received unsafe doses of cod liver oil and other vitamin A supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.\n\nChristamighty, I can see the medical examiner’s report now: “Cause of Death: Did Own Research on Internet.”",

        "content": "As much as I abhor the cliché, the video really does look like something out of a movie—one of the Mission: Impossible sequels, maybe, or Taken 25. A young woman in a white coat is confronted on a sidewalk in Somerville, Massachusetts, right here in the U.S.A., by a group of masked individuals in dark clothing. The young woman does not put up a struggle as she is placed in restraints and shuffled off into a dark-colored SUV and gone. The whole thing takes two minutes and three seconds. A little slice of East Germany for you nostalgics out there.\n\nFrom The Boston Globe:\n\nPlainclothes officers handcuffed Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national in the US on a student visa, and loaded her into an unmarked SUV with tinted windows as she pleaded for explanations, according to video of the arrest. She was transferred to Louisiana despite a federal judge ordering US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday night not to remove Ozturk from Massachusetts without prior notice.\n\nThe precise timing of Ozturk’s transfer to Louisiana and the issuance of the judge’s order was unclear. It was also unclear why the government targeted Ozturk, who is doctoral candidate at Tufts department of child study and human development. She had voiced support for the pro-Palestinian movement at Tufts, but was not known as a prominent leader. Her lawyer said she is not aware of any charges against her. “I don’t understand why it took the government nearly 24 hours to let me know her whereabouts,” her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said. “Why she was transferred to Louisiana despite the court’s order is beyond me. Rumeysa should immediately be brought back to Massachusetts, released, and allowed to return to complete her PhD program.”\n\nThis comes after border czar Tom Homan has made Boston a particular focus of his attention and admitted the other day that some of the 370 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a six-day operation were not criminals but “collaterals.”\n\nThe proximate cause of Ozturk’s being disappeared off a public street and off to Louisiana is that she took a side in a foreign conflict to which the United States isn’t even directly a party. Even if it were, of course, there would be no excuse for snatching people off the street and shipping them off to detention without even a wave at due process, in defiance of the constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus and contrary to an order from a federal court.\n\nYes, there are similar precedents in American history going all the way back to the passage of the Alien Enemies Act, the 18th-century law that so appeals to the president’s medieval lizard brain. And yes, more recently, there has been the long, slow slide toward authoritarianism, most notably during the Cointelpro days in the 1960s and, especially, in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, which saw wars of choice, a concentration camp in Cuba, extraordinary rendition, black sites all over the globe, and a torture regime that attempted to camouflage barbarism with euphemism. And even with a change of administrations, there were drone strikes until hell wouldn’t have them, rubble bouncing and gratuitous death. And, of course, back home, a bipartisan consensus against true accountability, exercised through direct stonewalling and, more delicately, through “looking forward, not back,” and the Constitution be damned.\n\nAll that being said, this video is different by an order of magnitude. This is an illegitimate act of political kidnapping, straight out of the Pinochet–Videla–Ríos Montt playbook. And it is no longer an isolated incident. ICE put the bag on another grad student, this one at the University of Alabama. From The Guardian:\n\nA spokesperson for the state’s flagship university said in a brief statement that a student was arrested “off campus” by federal immigration officials, but declined to comment further, citing privacy laws. The US government’s justification for detaining the student was not immediately clear, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday. News of the arrest comes amid reports of the Trump administration increasingly targeting college students for arrest and deportation across the country, including people in the US on visas and permanent residents with green cards, raising alarms on campuses and in surrounding communities.\n\nThis is about rescinding valid immigration status for the purposes of being Bibi Netanyahu’s international goon squad, squashing dissent against his government by illegitimately using the power of our own. There was a time in my life that this would leave me in an ungovernable rage. Now I’m hardly surprised.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Vice President J Divan Vance continues to make friends and influence nobody on the world stage. This time, the topic was the president’s lunatic dream of seizing Greenland from Denmark. (But not, curiously, making it a state, which, according to the president’s other lunatic dream, is his plan for Canada.) Because he is a good boy who deserves favor, Vance explained that the time has come once again for us to exercise the Divine Right of Lunatics. From The Independent:\n\nAsked whether he believed the U.S. could acquire Greenland during an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in February, Vance said: “I think it’s possible, Maria. Here’s the thing which I think a lot of folks don’t appreciate about Greenland. It’s really important to our national security,” the vice president claimed. Vance explained that there are “sea lanes” surrounding Greenland, used by the Chinese and the Russians. The former Ohio senator accused the Danish government of restricting U.S. access and, therefore, “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.”\n\nThank you, Yale dude. I never noticed that Greenland was an island and, therefore, surrounded by sea lanes. And considering that the current president—and, therefore, his good boy VP—never shuts up about seizing the place, I’d restrict our access to it as well.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview, which discussed several of Trump’s measures, Vance suggested that the only real solution to the national security issue was to take “more territorial interest in Greenland.” He stressed that Trump would take the island if necessary, saying, “That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn’t care about what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first.”\n\nSorry, Yale dude. I lived through the decades in which what was once the Soviet Union was a serious military threat to the U.S., albeit occasionally an overhyped one, and not a dead-broke kleptocracy. And in those days, we were content with the DEW line and all the other safeguards stationed in and around the Arctic. I do not wake in the night terrified about Russian fishing trawlers. And I don’t think I want to take up in a country dedicated to the geopolitics of the Reverend G.I. Grabitall.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the first commando raid of the takeover has been launched. It was led by the White House national security advisor, a hack named Mike Waltz, and Usha Vance, wife to J Divan. Their arrival was not greeted with a Laurel and Hardy handshake. From The Guardian:\n\nGreenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”. Mike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. Trump has pledged to make the autonomous territory—part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy—part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate. “Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” He added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nAs it happens, Egede’s party lost the last election. The winners are trying to build a coalition government right now, and the one thing they don’t need is a state visit from representatives of a country threatening a hostile takeover of the whole island. I don’t believe it’s coincidental. They’re looking at Greenland like it’s an exercise in vulture capitalism. Striking. Hot irons. That kind of thing.",

He achieved some fame in wing-nut circles by proposing that the state’s legislature declare “Trump Derangement Syndrome” a legitimate form of mental illness. Chuffed by his newfound eminence among the goobers, Eichorn apparently decided to make a phone call. From the AP:\n\nGOP Sen. Justin Eichorn, 40, of Grand Rapids, was arrested in Bloomington on Monday in an undercover operation targeting commercial sex involving juveniles. Investigators had placed multiple ads online offering sex for money, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Court documents indicate Eichorn started sending messages in response to the ads March 11. “I saw your post and (sic) chance you are still available tonight?” one asked, according to an FBI affidavit, while a later message asked, “What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nEichorn exchanged messages with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl over several days, asking about pricing for various sex acts and requesting a picture, the affidavit said. They arranged a meet-up on Monday, where he arrived to find police ready to arrest him. Officers seized two cellphones, a condom, and $129 in cash, it said.\n\nPoor guy. Seems like all he wanted was to FA and all that happened was that he FO in a big way. What’s left for the guy? “FI” and “FUM,” I guess.\n\nWe move along to the Commonwealth (God save it!), where The Boston Globe’s Spotlight unit locked onto some serious police misconduct in the area of confidential informants in the city of New Bedford.\n\nWithin the department, Jorge Santos was a rising star. Barely 30, he was part of a specialized squad—the marine unit—tasked with overseeing a stretch of the city’s busy waterfront. Brash and aggressive, he won raves for his work ethic from supervisors, his impressive arrest totals recounted in the local media. In policing’s vernacular, he was a worker, the kind of hard-charging officer who delivered the stats that made bosses look good.\n\nAmong many in the department’s rank-and-file, however, Santos had a far different reputation. He’d long been known as a loose cannon, a reckless officer who cut corners and maybe more. A colleague in the marine unit had warned police higher-ups that Santos was a liability. Officer Mark Raposo told supervisors he would no longer back up Santos on calls because he didn’t want to put himself in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a bizarre scene aboard a fishing boat in which a New Bedford police officer, responding to a disturbance call on the boat, found himself in the middle of a scrum involving the boat’s crew and another member of the New Bedford PD.\n\nNow, Raposo was getting radioed by dispatch and ordered to sort out what exactly was happening aboard the Little Tootie.\n\nScreaming. Fighting. Shouts about drugs and money. And in the middle of the scrum stood his colleague, Santos, mumbling about a “confidential informant.”\n\nRaposo stood there, befuddled. What was his colleague—off-duty, armed, alone, and without a warrant or any paperwork—doing here in the middle of the night, tussling with some out-of-town fishermen? This wasn’t some clandestine police operation, Raposo thought. It was a robbery, a “drug rip,” in Raposo’s words. The perpetrator was a fellow cop. And the supposed confidential informant behind it? Probably a fabrication, Raposo figured.\n\nOh, lovely. Overuse of confidential informants has resulted in serious abuse of the concept of confidential informants. (According to Spotlight’s examination of what records they could squeeze out of the state’s various police departments, nine out of every ten drug busts in the Commonwealth—God save it!—depended vitally on the use of CIs. The other installments in the Spotlight series describe how the rise of New Bedford’s current police chief was fueled by his making busts based on what he said was information from CIs, and an account by a former CI about his terrifying life in Kafkaland in a Massachusetts prison.\n\n“ ‘Confidential informant’ is really a misnomer, because they’re not providing just confidential information,” said Lance Block, a Florida-based attorney who has helped craft legislation aimed at establishing protections for informants. “I call them ‘civilian operatives’ ... because they’re doing what police officers do.” He questions the whole premise. “We don’t use civilians to direct traffic at a football game, and yet we’re going to use civilians to go undercover and potentially put their life at risk?” he adds. “It just makes no sense.”\n\nWe hop on our pirogue and choogle on down to LOO-si-yana where Governor Greg Landry is letting his bon temps rouler in the state’s death chambers. From Bolts:\n\n\n\nSince taking office as governor in January 2024, Landry has signed a flurry of bills functionally abolishing parole going forward, granting police greater immunity, and moving all 17-year-olds into the adult criminal system, even those accused of minor crimes. But the symbolic heart of Landry’s “tough on crime” agenda has been his drive to resume state-sponsored killings. In 2018, Landry had criticized then-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, for not doing enough to jumpstart executions. Once governor, he did not mince words: “Capital punishment is lawful, and we intend to fulfill our legal duty to resume it,” he told legislators at the start of a special legislative session on crime that he called as one of his first official acts as governor.\n\nThe session was a blitzkrieg: Over the nine days it met, the Republican-controlled legislature reauthorized execution by electrocution and legalized nitrogen hypoxia. It also passed a “secrecy statute” that shields execution procedures from scrutiny, rendering them easier to carry out and harder to challenge. In February, Landry announced that the state had formalized a protocol for nitrogen killings. Three executions were quickly scheduled back to back in March. Then, nearly as quickly, one was taken off the calendar after it became clear that the prisoner in question hadn’t exhausted his appeals. Another execution scheduled for this month didn’t happen after the 81-year-old who was slated to be killed died of natural causes.\n\nThe piece centers on one death-row inmate named Chris Duncan and alleges that he may have been framed by a couple doctors who claimed to specialize in “forensic odontology”—i.e., bite marks—but whose work had been steadily discredited by other specialists in that field. (A video emerged that seemed to show one of these doctors using a mold of Duncan’s teeth to inflict the bite marks on the corpse of the victim, a young girl.) This occurred as bite-mark evidence itself was losing its credibility in court.\n\nIt wasn’t just Hayne and West, though: Bite mark analysis itself was being debunked. As of last year, [Journalist Radley] Balko told me, “every single scientific body to evaluate the merit of bite mark analysis has said there’s no scientific merit to it whatsoever.” During a 2012 deposition, even West changed his tune, saying, “I no longer believe in bite mark analysis. I don’t think it should be used in court,” though he would later continue to defend the practice in media interviews. Today, it routinely gets dismissed as junk science. “This bite mark stuff—it’s, I think the legal term is total bullshit,” Stafford Smith said.\n\nDuncan’s effort to secure a new trial is still hanging fire. All that’s changed is that Landry is now governor and he’s dedicated himself to limiting the appeals process that kept Duncan alive long enough to expose the two forensic “experts” as quacks. Bad enough that so many politicians are so determined to kill people, but there’s no reason to be quite so gleeful about it.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Outdoor Café Specialist Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of a state legislature grown exhausted by an excess of democracy. From Tulsa Public Radio:\n\nSenate Bill 1027 would limit the number of initiative petition signatures that could come from high-population areas and would require anyone collecting signatures to be an Oklahoma registered voter. The measure is headed to the state House after the full Senate approved it on Tuesday with a party-line vote of 36-8. The bill would require that no more than 10% of signatures on an initiative petition could come from a county where 400,000 or more people reside. That would affect only residents of Tulsa and Oklahoma counties by capping the total share of signatures from those two counties at 20%.\n\nNaturally, you don’t want signatures collected where the most people live because math is hard. That those two counties happen to be the state’s most heavily Democratic ones is purely coincidental, I am sure.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "content": "’Fi were king of the forest, and I had a friend who was a know-nothing dilettante, a dude with a couple billion dollars’ worth of business dealings with China, and a ketamine fan into the bargain, I might think twice about something like this. From The New York Times:\n\nAnother official said the briefing would be China focused, without providing additional details. A fourth official confirmed Mr. Musk was to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but offered no details. Hours after news of the planned meeting was published by The New York Times. Pentagon officials and President Trump denied that the session would be about military plans involving China. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night social media post. It was not clear if the briefing for Mr. Musk would go ahead as originally planned. But providing Mr. Musk access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded military secrets would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to Mr. Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose.\n\nSomehow, I am rarely reassured by what is said by the president in “late-night social media” posts. Neither am I reassured by the fact that the Pentagon is currently run by a former Jägermeister spokesmodel.\n\nPentagon war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are among the military’s most closely guarded secrets. If a foreign country were to learn how the United States planned to fight a war against them, it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less likely to succeed. The top-secret briefing that exists for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict. It covers the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period, that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions, according to officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nLastly, I am not reassured by the fact that, if it ever came to guns with China, this guy’s creations would be fighting for both sides, and not just because whatever it is he manufactured is even money to glitch itself into the Mariana Trench shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nLosing Democracy by the Dose—A Novel.",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "It may be the distraction everybody says it is. It may be a shot across the bow from a corrupt president against investigators who might choose to inconvenience him. It could be both of those. But the release Tuesday of nearly 70,000 pages of heretofore classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy is an early Easter basket full of very interesting accounts of the covert doings of the CIA in the 1960s. And whatever the motives behind their release may be, it is all information that we should have had years ago. The good people at the National Security Archive have sorted through much of the massive information dump and filtered out some very tasty nuggets. For example:\n\nThere is a “family jewels” memo to William Colby dated June 1, 1973, at the height of the revelations regarding the CIA’s history of international dirty tricks. This one begins with a genuinely hilarious spasm of bureaucratic linguistic gymnastics.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone’s files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA’s charter.\n\nA special kind of motivation like, say, telling the country what was being done in its name. Like, say, burglarizing a foreign embassy in Washington.\n\nAs a result of a developing relationship with Philippe de Vosjoli, the SDECE representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by Anatole Golitson, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from the French Consulate.\n\nAlthough certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection against foreign installation in this country.\n\n“Which assumes a new significance today”? Oh, please, do go on.\n\nFinally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone’s dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.\n\nHoly Borgias, Batman. My eyebrows are on the ceiling.\n\nThere’s also a 40-page document detailing CIA meddling in elections all over the globe, as well as with a rising revolutionary movement in Yemen.\n\nAnd there’s an oblique mention that’s going to ring all kinds of bells among Oliver Stone fans.\n\nAlso in the afternoon, the Deputy Director (Plans) read to the Panel a paper on Operation Mongoose which the Director had used earlier in the day for briefing the President. This paper was used on the instruction of the Director. The Panel asked questions about agency activity in Cuba, all of which were answered with the exception of one having to do with the role of the Attorney General. This query was raised by Mr. [Gordon] Gray who recognized and gracefully accepted the fact that he not answered directly.\n\nMr. Gray, who had been the National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration, thus gets a gold star for being incurious.\n\nAgain, there’s very likely nothing in here that will tell us much about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But there’s a great deal to be said for setting the scene, and the American intelligence community was a cynical, occasionally criminal, gang. The more we know about that, the better, and the more evidence we have that JFK had the right idea in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs came a cropper. A thousand pieces, and scattered to the winds.\n\n",

From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts because the servers were overloaded. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones at the front desk as receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. But the agency no longer has a system to monitor customers’ experience with these services, because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk.\n\nAnd the phones keep ringing. And ringing.\n\nThe federal agency that delivers $1.5 trillion a year in earned benefits to 73 million retired workers, their survivors and poor and disabled Americans is engulfed in crisis—further undermining its ability to provide reliable and quick service to vulnerable customers, according to internal documents and more than two dozen current and former agency employees and officials, customers and others who interact with Social Security.\n\nHeartless, because the Porcelain Man doesn’t care about any carbon-based life-form except himself, and he’s probably working on that, too. Gutless, because they wouldn’t dare come for Social Security in a frontal assault. (George W. Bush tried that, and his 2004 mandate vanished overnight.) So they weaken it from within, day after day, cut after cut, until they can claim that the system is broken and they can push it over so it shatters. The finest social-welfare program in the country’s history, as transformative a public-policy victory as any other, and it is being crippled unto death by a South African blow-in with enough money to buy the future so he can trash it.\n\nLeland Dudek—the accidental leader elevated to acting commissioner after he fed data to Musk’s team behind his bosses’ backs—has issued rapid-fire policy changes that have created chaos for front-line staff. Under pressure from the secretive Musk team, Dudek has pushed out dozens of officials with years of expertise in running Social Security’s complex benefit and information technology systems. Others have left in disgust.\n\nHe sounds like a swell fella. There is nobody in this administration worthy of the trust you’d give to a Gaboon viper. And that includes the guy at the top.\n\nAlarmed lawmakers are straining to answer questions from angry constituents in their districts. Calls have flooded into congressional offices. The AARP announced on Monday that more than 2,000 retirees per week have called the organization since early February—double the usual number—with concerns about whether benefits they paid for during their working careers will continue. Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans. Trump has said repeatedly that the administration “won’t touch” Social Security, a promise that aides say applies to benefit levels that can only be adjusted by Congress. But in just six weeks, the cuts to staffing and offices have already taken a toll on access to benefits, officials and advocates say.\n\n“Trump Has Said Repeatedly” may be the singularly worthless phrase in the English language.",

Suki Waterhouse, for one, slipped into a whimsical spring 2025 look by Valentino designer Alessandro Michele; The sheer-top gown featured a sequined and embroidered floral skirt, complete with an Old Hollywood-style faux fur shawl. Speaking of Old Hollywood glamour, Victoria Monet opted for a plunging sweetheart-neckline gown by LaQuan Smith, though the netted skirt made it feel fresh. Jennie gravitated towards a similar silhouette in her red Zuhair Murad dress, with a lip to match.\n\nTyla, meanwhile, opted for sheer drama in her laced Jean Paul Gaultier Couture gown with exposed briefs. (Naked dresses aren’t going anywhere in Hollywood, it seems). There were even some unexpected archival wins, too. Doechii looked to a sheer black Donna Karan slip from 2014, and it felt just as current and modern today.\n\nBelow, see the best looks from the 2025 Billboard Women in Music Awards.",

        "content": "Worried you’re not getting enough protein? For years, I didn’t. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I thought that if I ate too much protein and worked out, I would become bulky—like those muscle men who slam weights around in the gym. It also didn’t help that I grew up in the 2000s, when cereal and granola bars were considered “health food.” Hungry in the middle of the morning? Just have some Special K!\n\nIt’s no wonder I had a bad relationship with food—I ate little more for breakfast than a bowl of fruit. I had cravings all the time, felt exhausted, and experienced mental lapses. And, for the record, my muscles were basically non-existent.\n\nOf course, I’m not alone—many people don’t consume enough protein. In fact, many people do not even include it in the first meal of the day. “For example, in Spain, we eat pan con tomate—bread with tomato—for breakfast and do not add protein,” notes nutrition expert Mariana Sánchez Díaz.\n\nThese days, however, we are getting wise to the fact that getting adequate protein is not just necessary—it is vital for women as we age. It’s also especially important to get it in the morning: Studies show that eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast can prevent fatigue and cravings between meals. “Eggs, Greek yogurt, or rich protein sources such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna help control appetite throughout the day while supporting a faster metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving cognitive function,” explains nutritionist and biologist Anastasiia Kaliga of the holistic wellness app Luvly.\n\nAt the very least, experts say 10% of our daily calories should come from protein. To figure that out in grams, just multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36—the result is the minimum amount of protein in grams you should aim for each day.\n\nSigns you’re not getting enough protein\n\nWhen I finally realized that I wasn’t getting enough protein for my body to function properly, it was because my menstrual cycle became irregular. (Turns out protein is important for hormones, too.)\n\nMissing periods, experts say, is just one sign you may not be getting enough protein. Other symptoms? Swelling in the hands and feet, getting sick frequently, feeling depressed, or having wounds that are slow to heal. Below, nutritionists share a few more signs of not getting enough protein.\n\nFatigue\n\n“In extreme cases, you can be tired and lack energy,” explains nutritionist Mariana Pérez-Trejo Soltwedel. “After all, consuming balanced meals—including protein—is key to keeping the immune system functioning and for regulating your hormones.”",

        "content": "Last week may have marked the official start to spring, but this week, the best dressed stars on the red carpets continued the spirit of the season with their striking fashion choices. Thanks to their choice of bold colors, interesting texture plays, and perfect springy silhouettes, these A-listers shed their heavy winter layers in favor of light, upbeat frocks that shined easily on their own.\n\nThe 2025 Billboard Women in Music Awards, held just last night, delivered plenty of eye-catching looks. Jennie took a modern approach to Old Hollywood dressing with her red, sweetheart-neckline Zuhair Murad gown. Doechii, meanwhile, went archival in a black Donna Karan slip from 2014—yet it felt just as fresh and current today.\n\nSpeaking of a more retro sensibility, Mikey Madison embraced a more groovy 1970s aesthetic while attending her Saturday Night Live after-party in New York (fresh off hosting, no less): The Oscar winner chose a faux fur-lined Chloé coat in teal. Boho-chic lives on!\n\nStellar suiting with unexpected shapes also had a moment this week. In New York, Selena Gomez emerged in a red Magda Butrym blazer styled overtop a dress with a built-in rosette detail. In L.A., Carey Mulligan stopped by the Jimmy Kimmel show in a black Bottega Venta blazer with scalloped detailing, and with a fresh new chop. Sure, a classic suit will never tire—but these updated versions gave their looks extra pep.\n\nWhich were your favorite celebrity looks this week? Vote below, and check back on Friday to see who Vogue readers crowned best dressed.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

Along with other trompe l’oeil items, bags cinched with belts, or embellished with leather, chainmail, or studs also made their mark during fashion month. And in a season dominated by conversations about femininity, it comes as no surprise that we saw an influx of vanity cases doubling as a handbag; while oversized clutches made for a bold statement, were the perfect statement accessory that can also serve double duty as a makeshift umbrella when the weather quickly changed, as it so often did this season.

        "content": "No, it’s not an April Fool’s Day joke—the long-running rumors have finally been confirmed, and we now know that four different films about the rise of The Beatles are officially on their way. The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event will be directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes, and star four of the most in-demand young British and Irish actors working today: none other than Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Saltburn’s Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, Babygirl’s Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, and Gladiator II’s Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.\n\nJoseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan, Harris Dickinson, and Paul Mescal at CinemaCon 2025. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe auteur confirmed the news on March 31 at CinemaCon, showing up towards the end of the Sony Pictures presentation to reveal further details. The logline for all four projects reads: “Each man has his own story, but together they are legendary.” To that end, these will be four interconnected biopics, one from each band member’s point of view. The exact order in which the films will be released is not yet known, though all four will hit the big screen in April 2028, in what the director describes as the first “bingeable moment in cinema.” (Think of it as Barbenheimer times two.)\n\nCalling The Beatles “the most significant band of all time,” one which “redefined the culture and stayed with you for a lifetime,” Mendes added that he had “been trying to do a film for years, but I finally gave up” because he felt the “story was too big for one film” and a TV series didn’t seem quite right. “There had to be a way to tell the epic story for a new generation,” he continued. “I can assure you there is still plenty left to explore and I think we found a way to do that.” We certainly can’t wait to see what he comes up with.",

This month alone, the Miami resident has repeatedly been spotted frolicking with boyfriend Joaquim Valente out on the water (many times on private boat trips). Since they welcomed a baby boy together back in February, they have wasted no time getting back to their regular scheduled programming—which includes beaches, beaches, and more beaches. Yesterday, for one, they opted for perhaps the most Miami workout of all: an aquatic bike ride.\n\nBündchen pedaled around the ocean wearing a chic two-piece activewear set. The star wore a criss-cross black sports bra and paired it with what appeared to be a matching black skort. A sleek all-black wardrobe has fast become her signature beach look lately, whether she’s wearing a black swimsuit or sarong. Bündchen completed the look with a wide-brimmed chapeau and oversized shades.\n\nPhoto: Backgrid\n\nThroughout Bündchen pregnancy, the model’s maternity style stayed true to her easy-breezy essence. Last year, she wore a collection of neutral crocheted cover-ups and linen caftans—which all struck the perfect balance of comfort and chic. This latest sighting suggests that her postpartum style will also remain blissfully beachy.",

The exhibition, which will go on to Seoul and Tokyo, is the first retrospective on Peñafiel’s artisanal techniques and highlights their importance in the Lemaire wardrobe, as well as the need to invigorate fashion as a space for creative expression. It features his evocative and handcrafted pieces, like hats and masks, from past and present collections, as well as prototypes and unique sculptures.\n\n“During our early working sessions and trips, I got to know Peñafiel as a reserved man who spoke elliptically about his creative process, but had a deeply intuitive and experimental approach to materials,” Tran says.\n\nThere is a sensuality in both Peñafiel and Lemaire’s work: A shared celebration of the body, and an interrogation of functionality and flesh. “A mysterious duality emerges when the sensual curves of Peñafiel’s bags are paired with the humble lines of Lemaire garments,” says Tran. “They are like a magic lamp, an object of erotic projection that stimulates touch and imagination. His pieces are outer shells, objects of desire, conversation starters, and magical—and sometimes bawdy—amulets, which serve as humorous and sensual reminders of the power of the haptic, or ‘touching with the eyes.’”",

        "content": "If clothes make the man, logic has it that they also make the television character—which is why, every Sunday night, we observe the outfits on The White Lotus as closely as we do the people: like when Jaclyn wears a shiny, attention-grabbing Valentino mini-dress, or Saxon shows an affinity for needlepoint accessories from Smathers & Branson (a WASP-approved brand if ever there was one). And while few would argue that anyone on The White Lotus is aspirational—one of them is about to commit murder, after all—their clothes sometimes are: This is a really wealthy cohort, and it shows. You can judge Chloe all you want for being with Gary, but the matching pale pink swimsuit and pareo set from Jacquemus that she wears on his yacht is beyond reproach. The same goes for Victoria Ratliff and her Gucci bamboo bag. “We don’t do quiet luxury,” The White Lotus costume designer Alex Bovaird previously told Vogue.\n\nHere, a breakdown of the brands most beloved by this season’s cast of White Lotus guests—and what they say about them.\n\nPiper Ratliff",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, I'm Twiggy,\n\nand this is my Life in Looks.\n\n[intriguing mellow orchestral music]\n\nAh. [laughs]\n\nI do remember this.\n\nThis was taken by the wonderful Bert Stern\n\nwho, in the '50s and '60s,\n\nI think he was one of the biggest fashion photographers.\n\nAnd, actually, my first trip to New York,\n\nhe came on board to do a documentary of my trip.\n\nAnd I think there's a series of me pulling faces like this,\n\nkind of scrunching my nose up and going like that,\n\nand this one with my mouth open.\n\nIt's kind of been around a long time.\n\nBut he was such a brilliant man, a lovely photographer.\n\nThat first year of modeling\n\nafter I was discovered in February '66,\n\nwas like a whirlwind.\n\nI was a schoolgirl, and I was a mod.\n\nI used to do makeup at weekends\n\nand I devised that makeup and I became a model,\n\nwhich was three pairs of eyelashes on top,\n\nthe drawn ones underneath,\n\nwhich I got the idea from a ragdoll\n\nthat I had in my bedroom.\n\nSomebody had a friend of a friend who worked on a magazine\n\nand said, I think you should go and meet this woman,\n\n'cause I think you could maybe model.\n\nSo I met this woman.\n\nI was quite upset really,\n\n'cause she said, You'll never really make a model,\n\n'cause you're too small and you're much too slim.\n\nAnd so, I think I cried\n\non the way home on the bus. [chuckles]\n\nBut she said, I'm gonna do some test shots of your face,\n\n'cause you've got a very interesting face,\n\nbut your hair's a mess, 'cause I used to do it myself.\n\nAnd she sent me to this hairdressers called Leonard,\n\nwhich was a very posh salon in Mayfair, in London.\n\nI was gonna just have my hair styled for the photographs,\n\nand Leonard happened to be in that day,\n\nand he saw me across the salon\n\nand came over and said, Can I cut your hair?\n\nAnd I went back the next day\n\nand he did the now very well known haircut\n\nthat kind of launched me, really.\n\nHe hung the photograph\n\nthat Barry Lategan took of this haircut in his salon,\n\nand big journalist of the day, Deirdre McSharry,\n\nwho worked for the Daily Express\n\nsaid, I love the haircut.\n\nWho's the girl?\n\nI've never seen her before.\n\nAnd she said, I wanna meet her.\n\nSo I got a call at my home\n\nsaying would I go up for an interview?\n\nAnd she said, I'm gonna write an article about you.\n\nAnd I already had the nickname Twiggy,\n\n'cause my legs were so skinny.\n\nAbout three weeks later,\n\nit was a big page in the Daily Express\n\nsaying Twiggy the Face of '66.\n\nAnd, on that day in February,\n\nmy life changed forever. [chuckles]\n\nOh, it's another Bert.\n\nThis is April 15th, so that would be 1967.\n\nI think this is my first ever American Vogue cover.\n\nSo it's my first Vogue cover,\n\nbecause I worked for American Vogue\n\nbefore I worked for British Vogue.\n\nAnd that was because Diana Vreeland,\n\nwho was the fashion editor of American Vogue in those days,\n\nand she was, like, the queen of fashion.\n\nI mean, whatever Diana Vreeland said was it.\n\nAnd she brought me over from the UK to America,\n\nand really changed my life.\n\nI always say that Diana Vreeland turned me global.\n\nOh! [laughs]\n\nThis is funny.\n\nThis, I was approached to do a line of clothing\n\nby manufacturers.\n\nAnd I think this is the little fashion show\n\nthat I did in the showroom,\n\nbecause all the press photographers are there,\n\nof my first collection of Twiggy dresses.\n\nI loved doing that.\n\nIt was like a dream come true,\n\nbecause, if what happened to me hadn't happened,\n\nwhat I wanted to do, I wanted to go to art school\n\nand I wanted to study fashion and design,\n\n'cause I wanted to be a fashion designer.\n\nSo, I got two wishes;\n\nI got to be a model, and I got to work on a collection.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOh, this is interesting.\n\nThis is from a series of photographs\n\ntaken by another great photographer, Melvin Sokolsky.\n\nAnd, on my first trip to New York in '67,\n\nI was hired to do photographs of clothing range.\n\nIt was a fabric company,\n\nand Melvin was taking the photographs,\n\nand he wanted to do me all in different places in New York,\n\nlike at the zoo,\n\nand this was with builders on a building site,\n\nand coming outside of a department store,\n\nand up the Empire State Building.\n\nAnd the first day we went out, a crowd would gather,\n\nbecause what had happened, I had arrived in New York,\n\nit was my first trip to New York,\n\nand I'd come in after The Beatles,\n\nI was part of the British invasion. [chuckles]\n\nSo people had seen me arriving at the airport,\n\n'cause there was a press conference and crowds of girls.\n\nI mean, I was overwhelmed by it all.\n\nI'd gone in to do a fashion shoot,\n\nand I had all this press coverage.\n\nWhen we went out and Melvin was taking the pictures,\n\na crowd would gather,\n\nand he would try and disperse them,\n\nbut they kept coming back.\n\nSo he had this idea,\n\nhe took me back to the studio\n\nand took photos of my face in black-and-white,\n\nwhich they made masks of, which you can see here.\n\nSo, wherever we were in New York, when a crowd gathers,\n\nhe just gave out the masks,\n\nand the plan was to collect them back every day\n\nand use them the next day,\n\nbut people wouldn't give them back,\n\nthey were keeping them as a souvenir.\n\nAnd, actually, it won them,\n\nI think, best advertising campaign of the year, I think.\n\nIt was an amazing time.\n\nAh!\n\nI love this photograph, actually.\n\nThis was taken by Richard Avedon.\n\nIt is July, it says there,\n\nso it must have been July, 1967\n\non that first big trip to New York.\n\nThey had the idea to paint this flower on my face,\n\nit's beautiful actually,\n\nand slick my hair back.\n\nOver the years, a lot of people,\n\nthey've done copies of this photograph,\n\nwith famous actresses, recreated it.\n\nBut it's a beautiful photograph.\n\nOh.\n\nI remember this very well.\n\nThis is from my first movie called The Boy Friend,\n\nin which I played the lead girl called Polly Browne,\n\nand it was directed by Ken Russell.\n\nThere's a scene in it\n\nwhere it's a song called Poor Little Pierrette.\n\nSo I've got a pierrette and pierrot outfit on\n\nwith the little ballet slippers,\n\nand the white clown face.\n\nHis wife, Shirley Russell did all the costume,\n\nand she was absolutely brilliant.\n\nShe did all the costumes for all his films,\n\nand she was amazing.\n\nAnd all my clothes in The Boy Friend,\n\nthey're so beautiful,\n\nbecause they're all like 1920s, '30s.\n\nThey're absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI think I was like 18 and a half when we started filming.\n\nIt came out I think in '70 or '71,\n\nand I won two Golden Globe Awards for it.\n\nAnd it changed my life,\n\nbecause, from then on,\n\nI decided I didn't wanna model anymore,\n\nI wanted to pursue this acting musical career, which I did.\n\nAh.\n\nThe Bowie Pin Ups photograph.\n\nThis is interesting, actually,\n\nbecause I got a call from British Vogue\n\nabout doing a photograph with David Bowie.\n\nThis must have been probably early '70s.\n\nYou've gotta remember that Bowie was enormous.\n\nHe was the biggest pop star\n\ncertainly in the UK and probably in the world,\n\nand I was a huge, huge fan.\n\nAnd a couple of years earlier,\n\nI'd been at home and on the radio,\n\nyou know, they were playing pop music,\n\nand his new single came out\n\nand it was called Drive-In Saturday,\n\nand there's a line in it where he says\n\nShe'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid,\n\nand I was like, Oh my God.\n\nDavid Bowie just said my name in a song.\n\nI was like, Oh I was so...\n\n'Cause I loved him, I thought he was brilliant.\n\nAnd then, a few months later, I got the call\n\nsaying would I'd be up for doing a photograph\n\nfor the cover of Vogue with Bowie?\n\nAnd I said, Absolutely, I'd love it,\n\n'cause I'd never met him.\n\nHe was, at the time, in Paris recording the Pin Ups album.\n\nSo I went to Paris and met him.\n\nAnd, you know, he was just amazing man,\n\nso bright, so clever, so modest,\n\njust a really great guy,\n\napart from being incredibly talented.\n\nAnd we got on really well.\n\nWe did the photograph, I went back to London,\n\nand then the then editor said,\n\nWe can't put a man on the cover of British Vogue.\n\nThey wouldn't budge.\n\nSo while we were going back and forth with them,\n\nDavid said, Why don't I just put it on the cover\n\nof my album?\n\nWhich he did,\n\nso it became the cover of Pin Ups,\n\nand it's had a much longer life, actually,\n\nbecause every time it's reissued in a different format,\n\nout comes the cover of Pin Ups. [laughs]\n\nAw!\n\nAw, that's happy memories.\n\nThis is taken in the Big Biba store.\n\nNow, Biba, for those who don't know,\n\nI think most people in fashion do know,\n\nBiba was the dream place to go and shop\n\nin the mid '60s, late 60's, into the early '70s.\n\nBiba was the first place in London\n\nthat you could buy affordable clothes for young people.\n\nAnd Biba was the inspiration\n\nof a wonderful, wonderful lady\n\nwho was one of my dear, dear friends,\n\nI love her so much, Barbara Hulanicki.\n\nAnd Barbara brought Biba to London.\n\nThis is one of the photographs taken in the Big Biba,\n\n'cause it went from a tiny boutique to a mid-size boutique,\n\nand then they took over a department store,\n\nand it was one of the most beautiful department stores\n\nin the world.\n\nBut I love this, 'cause it's my memory of Barbara.\n\nOh gosh!\n\nIn 1983, I was doing a big Broadway musical\n\ncalled My One and Only with Tommy Tune.\n\nThis was the night of the Tony Awards,\n\nand I had this dress made.\n\nActually, it's very high-cut.\n\nI've just... [laughs].\n\nI just went to a dress maker, I did a drawing,\n\nand I said, Can you make this?\n\nAnd I had the points here that go over the finger.\n\nSo I love my hair.\n\nI think I did that by braiding it the night before.\n\nBut it was a great night.\n\nI mean, it's always a great night,\n\nyou know, it's the biggest night for theater in New York.\n\nOh.\n\nThis must be another pap shot.\n\nThis is the mid '90s Drama League Awards,\n\nwhich I think are in New York.\n\nBut it's interesting\n\nbecause my signature look has mostly been,\n\nif I go back to look at the clothes that I love,\n\nI love that boyish kind of look,\n\nmen's trouser suits.\n\nYou couldn't get men's suits for women in those days.\n\nSo I went to a tailor called Tommy Nutter in Savile Row.\n\nHe was one of my friends\n\nand one of the great tailors of that era.\n\nAnd he used to make me, you know, boy suits\n\nwith waistcoats and trousers and the jacket.\n\nAnd this is a kind of,\n\nI don't think this is a Tommy Nutter,\n\nbut it's that kind of look.\n\nSo I've always loved that look.\n\nOh!\n\nWell, this one's interesting.\n\nSo this is early '90s.\n\nSo, bear in mind that I kind of quit modeling\n\nwhen I started doing The Boy Friend.\n\nSo, in 1970, I decided I wasn't gonna model anymore.\n\nI wanted to pursue my performing career.\n\nIn the early '90s,\n\nI got a call through my agent\n\nfrom a wonderful photographer called Steven Meisel.\n\nHe wanted to do a 10-page spread with me for Italian Vogue.\n\nI flew to New York, and we did this amazing spread.\n\nBut the funny thing\n\nis that I got to the studio in New York ahead of him,\n\nI was in makeup and hair,\n\nand he came in to say hello.\n\nI got up and said, Oh, it's so lovely to meet you,\n\nI'm a huge fan, and thank you for asking to do it.\n\nAnd he said, We've met before.\n\nAnd I went, Oh my God, I'm so...\n\nI don't remember.\n\nWhen did we meet? I don't remember.\n\nHe said, No, you wouldn't remember.\n\nHe said that I was 12. [laughs]\n\nAnd what had happened,\n\nwhen I first went to New York in 1967,\n\nhe was a 12-year-old boy, he lived in New Jersey,\n\nand he'd seen on the TV that I'd arrived in New York.\n\nHe and his friend decided they wanted to come and meet me.\n\nSo they took the day off school,\n\nthey got the ferry over from New Jersey to New York,\n\nthey found where Melvin Sokolsky studio was,\n\nthey rang the doorbell.\n\nAnd at the time,\n\nI was being filmed for the Bert Stern documentary.\n\nAnd somebody answered the door\n\nand they said, We wanna meet Twiggy,\n\nand the person said, No, you can't, go away.\n\nAnd the director of the documentary said,\n\nNo, no, bring them up.\n\nIt'd be good footage.\n\nSo these two young boys came out,\n\nI came out.\n\nNow, I don't remember this, and I told Steven that.\n\nHe said, You came out of the dressing room,\n\nand I said, Oh, I hope I was nice to you,\n\nand he said, No, you were lovely.\n\nAnd I signed pictures for them, and we chatted,\n\nand they went away really happy, apparently.\n\nAnd, apparently, he said to his friend\n\non the ferry back to New Jersey,\n\nhe said, One day, I'm gonna photograph her,\n\n'cause he'd always wanted to be a photographer.\n\nSo it took from 1967 to 1992, or whatever it was,\n\nfor him to photograph me,\n\nbut I just thought it was such a sweet story.\n\nAw, me and Kate.\n\nThis is by Solve Sundsbo,\n\nI hope I've pronounced that properly,\n\nhe's a Scandinavian photographer, wonderful photographer.\n\nAnd we were doing a shoot for i-D Magazine,\n\nand they were photographing all different models\n\nfrom different eras.\n\nAnd the day I was booked to go in,\n\nKate Moss was in.\n\nSo she was in in the morning and we overlapped,\n\nI went into makeup and Kate was having her photograph taken.\n\nAnd then Solve came to me and said,\n\nAs you're both here today,\n\nit would be lovely to get a picture of you together.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAnd I said, Well, I'd love it, I'm game for it.\n\nAnd he asked Kate, and she said,\n\nOh, yeah, that'd be great.\n\nI love the way she's leaning on me, it's brilliant.\n\nI love Kate, she's so lovely.\n\nAnd it's interesting,\n\nbecause we're both kind of the same height,\n\nI mean, she's obviously much younger than me.\n\nBut, you know, when I hit in the '60s,\n\nI wouldn't have been taken by a model agency,\n\n'cause I was too small and too thin.\n\nWhen what happened to me happened,\n\nit changed the criteria\n\nof what agencies would take girls on for.\n\nAnd Kate came along two decades later,\n\nand was very similar size and shape to me, when I began.\n\nAnd, you know, she's one of the great models,\n\nand one of the nicest girls in the world.\n\nI love her.\n\nOh, I remember this day.\n\nI won't forget this day,\n\nas long as I live, I don't think.\n\nI'm in a beautiful Stella McCartney suit that she made me\n\nand a hat,\n\nthat, funny enough, the little hat,\n\n'cause this is at the Palace, when I got my Damehood.\n\nThe hat, I went shopping\n\nwith my daughter and my granddaughter,\n\nand my granddaughter picked this hat.\n\nI think she was about...\n\nOh, she was quite little, about four or five.\n\nYou're meant to wear a hat at the Palace, so...\n\nI'll never forget the day.\n\nThey don't let you know that you're gonna be offered one.\n\nAnd I remember the day the letter came,\n\na few months before the ceremony.\n\nAnd it's a very official letter.\n\n[chuckles] I think my first thought was,\n\nOh my God, is it a tax letter, you know?\n\nNot that it should be, 'cause I pay my taxes.\n\nIt was just like, Oh, what's this?\n\nIt's very official.\n\nAnd when I opened it,\n\nit's all in very kind of legalese language.\n\nI thought it was saying that I'd got a CBE,\n\nwhich, you know, I was thrilled about,\n\nI just couldn't believe it.\n\nAt the bottom of the letter it said,\n\nIf you ring this number,\n\nthere'd be somebody you can talk to and ask question.\n\nSo I rang this nice lady\n\nand I said, you know, It's Twiggy here,\n\nI've just got my letter.\n\nAm I right in understanding it's a CBE\n\nthat I'm being offered by the Palace?\n\nAnd she said, No, no, it's a Damehood.\n\nI went, Oh my goodness. [laughs]\n\nShe said, I think you better sit down\n\nand make yourself a nice gin and tea. [laughs]\n\nI mean, I don't like gin, actually,\n\nbut it was given to me by the then Prince Charles,\n\nand now King Charles.\n\nWhen he pinned it on my jacket,\n\nhe said, It's about time you got this,\n\nwhich I thought was very sweet.\n\nAw!\n\nThis is the first poster for our film Twiggy,\n\nwhich is a documentary directed by Sadie Frost on my life.\n\nIt's just been released nationwide.\n\nIt happened because Sadie Frost,\n\nwho's a wonderful actress,\n\nand she's been a model and various things,\n\nand about three years ago,\n\nshe did a beautiful documentary on Mary Quant,\n\nand I do a podcast called Tea with Twiggy,\n\nand her people asked\n\nif she could come on to promote Quant.\n\nSo I said, Brilliant.\n\nShe came on the podcast, got on really well,\n\nand I said to her,\n\nAre you gonna do any other documentaries?\n\nAnd she said, I'd love to do another one.\n\nAnd she said, I loved doing Mary Quant,\n\nbecause I love doing all the stuff from the '60s,\n\nand getting all the archives,\n\nand it's such a great period.\n\nSo I'd like to find somebody\n\nthat worked within the '60s era.\n\nAnd then she said, Oh, I should do you. [chuckles]\n\nSo I kind of said, Oh, okay.\n\nWell, let's talk about it off camera.\n\nSo, the following week, we went out to lunch.\n\nAnd it's worked out brilliantly,\n\nand we had the premier a couple of weeks ago,\n\nand it's gone down a storm.\n\nSo I'm really happy for Sadie, I'm happy for me,\n\nand it's been a very happy experience.\n\nAnd I love that photo.\n\nAgain, that's an old photograph, but it's a nice poster.\n\nMost people have a photo album of their lives,\n\nbut to actually [chuckles] see your life unfold\n\nin front of you on a big screen,\n\nit's very emotional.\n\nYou know, it's interesting looking at these photographs,\n\nbecause I've done lots and lots of different things,\n\nI still continue to do lots of different things,\n\nand I think that's what's kept me\n\nkind of interested in my career,\n\nbecause I didn't stick to just modeling.\n\nBut it was because I met people\n\nwho gave me the chance to do other things.\n\nI think I was so young when I was discovered\n\nthat I was kind of thrown into that spotlight.\n\nI've had an amazing life, amazing career,\n\nI'm not moaning about it. [laughs]\n\nThis is Twiggy, and this has been my Life in Looks,\n\nand it's been amazing to look back.\n\nVery, very happy memories.\n\n[intriguing mellow orchestral music]",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "“The king came here last Monday,” David Hockney tells me when I visit him recently via Zoom at his London house and adjoining studio. “We talked for an hour, and the next day, when he was making Tracey Emin a dame, he told her he’d been to my studio. I don’t know what she thought of that.” The 87-year-old artist looks the way he always has, a bit diminished but jaunty and stylish as ever. His signature black-rimmed eyeglasses, huge and round, are bright yellow now. His hair is thinning and white. He’s wearing a turquoise sweater, a black-and-white checkerboard tie, and one of the nine patterned suits made for him by his favorite tailor in Cannes—it’s the same suit he wears when he’s painting, and the same one he’s wearing in his latest self-portrait.\n\nWhen we speak, he’s sitting at a cluttered table in his living room, in front of a floor-to-ceiling red velvet curtain. Tess, the beloved dachshund belonging to him and his partner Jean-Pierre (JP) Gonçalves de Lima, is barking somewhere else in the house. I ask him about the “End Bossiness Soon” button on his lapel. “I was going to put ‘End Bossiness Now,’ but then I thought that is in itself too bossy. There’s lots of bossy people around now, more than there used to be.” He lights a cigarette, somewhat defiantly, and inhales. The lining of his suit jacket is decorated with images of cigars. “I smoke anything,” he says, when I ask him if he smokes cigars as well. “I’ve lived long enough. I’ve been a professional artist for 70 years, and I’m just about to have the largest exhibition I’ve ever had.”\n\nThe exhibition he’s referring to opens April 9 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. Nearly 400 works—paintings, drawings, prints, and stage designs—will take over the entire Frank Gehry–designed building in the Bois de Boulogne. “It’s the biggest show they’ve ever had,” Gehry tells me, when I reach him by phone in Los Angeles. “I can’t wait to go and see it, because he doesn’t just hang paintings. He really takes over a building. He has the courage to do that.”\n\n“David considers this the most important show of his career,” says the art historian Norman Rosenthal, who is curating the exhibition. “He’s, in the best sense of the word, very ordinary. He’s just speaking to himself. And by speaking to himself, with himself, he speaks to everybody. He appeals to people without compromising his vision of the world.” The project is a personal one for LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault as well. “As an admirer of David Hockney’s work since the earliest days of his career,” he says, “I am delighted that Fondation Louis Vuitton will be presenting this landmark exhibition. Not only will the exhibition be remarkable in its scale, but with Hockney’s direct involvement in every aspect of it, it will offer an unparalleled insight into his creative universe and reveal the extraordinary evolution of his art over the past three quarters of a century.”\n\nPlay within a Play within a Play and Me with a Cigarette, 2024–25, acrylic on canvas with collage. Courtesy of David Hockney.\n\nThe scholar and head of contemporary programs at the Louvre museum, Donatien Grau, writes in the exhibition’s catalog (published by Thames & Hudson): “David is one of the greatest draughtsmen working today, with skills akin to those of Degas or Picasso.” Hockney has painted Grau’s portrait twice. “You could see the things that obsess him: colors, first and foremost,” Grau recalls. “He made the dark blue of my jacket sharper, the black of the trousers darker. The dots on my scarf—he painted them all, one by one. With the chair, you could almost identify every strand of the wicker.”\n\nThe chair in Hockney’s Kensington studio is a rather small, oddly patterned upholstered armchair, and all of his London portrait subjects know it well. Hockney has lived and worked in many different parts of the world—London, Los Angeles, Paris, Yorkshire, Normandy—but in the last couple of years, he’s moved back to London. His health is fragile, but his mind is as alert as ever, and he’s making new work in his studio every day. He can’t help doing it. When he’s not in the studio, he enjoys seeing his old friends and going to exhibitions—he saw the Van Gogh show at the National Gallery twice—and to the ballet and the opera. He reads voraciously, new art books and catalogs, and he loves biographies—recently Katherine Bucknell’s life of Christopher Isherwood.",

Just a few days into spring, we’ve already reported on the cool-girl approved suede sneaker, the eternally chic white dress, and an East-West handbag, or two. With that being said, we’d also argue that the dawn of a new season is the ideal time to go back to the basics, a.k.a. those timeless wardrobe staples that seem to always shine regardless of the time and place. And when it comes to the classics, nothing is as foundational in a closet as a plain, but perfect white tee. From Leset and Skims to The Row and Cos, we’re mapping out 7 white T-shirt outfits that deliver maximum style with minimal effort.\n\nVogue’s Favorite White T-Shirts:\n\nAllow your white tee to center each and every spring outfit idea you craft this season–it is the perfect blank canvas, after all. For starters, Leset’s famed Margo tee is the chicest of choices, especially when paired with crisp white denim. Or you could adhere ever so slightly to the trends and sling a butter yellow sweater across your shoulders. While the staple may be the epitome of casual, Lemaire’s scarf-detailed style becomes even cooler when worn with a wide-leg trouser from Dries Van Noten and sling bag.\n\nFor a twist on tailoring, style Madewell’s boxy tee with a pair of pleated khakis. No longer just a staple of your weekend wardrobe, a plain white tee is the ultimate everyday (and night) essential. Below, shop our edit of 7 white T-shirt outfits that will make your transition to spring effortlessly easy.\n\nThe Cult Classic\n\nThere’s no closet combination quite like a white T-shirt and jeans. Up the ante on the classic look by picking a pair of crisp white jeans and adding of-the-moment burgundy and brown extras.\n\nThe Boyish Cut\n\nNot too long, short, or boxy, Madewell’s white tee can (and should!) be tucked into anything. For spring, we’re wearing ours with a slightly preppy pair of pleated khakis and energizing bursts of citrus.\n\nThe Ultra Luxe\n\nThe Row’s extra soft slouchy tee can easily be dressed up or down. For an off-duty look, pair it with longline denim shorts and a cheeky sweater vest.\n\nThe Swingy Cut\n\nSacai’s swinging paneled tee adds complexity to a typical tee-and-trousers duo. Pinstripe pants and embellished mesh ballerinas are artful additions.\n\nThe Sporty Tee\n\nPlay in contrast by pairing Rabanne’s tie-dye maxi skirt with a sporty, close cut tee from Adidas and a pair of Nike thong sandals.\n\nThe Scarf Detail\n\nLean into the fluid elegance of Lemaire’s scarf-tie tee shirt by adding a pair of soft, tailored trousers and thoughtful accessories.\n\nThe Leather Tee\n\nA leather tee shirt may seem like an unexpected wardrobe essential, but a sharp white version from Stouls is surprisingly versatile. Dress it up with an asymmetric skirt, ladylike kitten heels, and cool-girl silver jewelry.",

However, we may earn affiliate revenue on this article and commission when you buy something.\n\nLocket necklaces are one of the most personal pieces of jewelry a person can own—a delicate, miniature time capsule made to hold cherished memories. With roots tracing back to the Victorian era, romantic amulets would daintily hang from a chain or velvet ribbon—storing everything from tiny hand-painted portraits to small locks of hair to honor a loved one—encasing personal treasures and adorned with gold, metals, gemstones, and intricate engravings.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Locket Necklaces:\n\nToday, the ritual continues, with locket necklaces serving as keepsakes for photos, charms, love letters, and secrets known only to the wearer—solidifying their legacy as timeless heirlooms. Among the most well-known lockets is the one retrieved from The Titanic—not exactly the heart-shaped blue diamond necklace that went by the “Heart of the Ocean” in the famous fictional love story—but that of Virginia Estelle McDowell Clark, a survivor whose husband did not survive the shipwreck. Her 18-karat gold locket was recovered from the ocean decades later—a testament to the piece’s enduring nature, having withstood the ultimate test of time and the elements.\n\nEach locket tells a unique story, inviting you to personalize it with your fondest memories. Whether you prefer modern heart-shaped designs that rest close to your heart, vintage-inspired pieces that echo their Victorian origins, or cleverly disguised chambers—here you’ll find the perfect locket to transform into your own personal treasure chest.\n\nPiece Of My Heart\n\nA heart-shaped locket is intended to be held close to your chest, becoming a memento of your loved ones. Stone and Strand’s Sweetheart locket can be personalized with an engraving on the outer shell, while Loquet London’s option can be home to a unique-to-you mix of cute charms.\n\nCatbird Dollhouse engravable gold heart locket $198 CATBIRD Marc Jacobs Heart Balloon locket $150 REVOLVE\n\nVintage-Inspired\n\nWear a locket with a design that nods to the Victorian era, or feels like a heritage heirloom passed through generations.\n\nThe Incognito Locket\n\nFor a modern take on the locket, consider a necklace whose latch may not be obvious at face value, but holds a secret chamber known only to the wearer. This Monbouquette locket, for example, comes with a tiny love letter inside to be personalized—the perfect gift for a loved one.\n\nMarie Lichtenberg Baby Shining Star Locket 14k gold, cord, diamond and pearl necklace $2,350 NET-A-PORTER Sorellina chrysoprase rondelle bead necklace $2,600 SHOPBOP",

        "content": "Miley Cyrus fans, set your calendar alerts: The singer is releasing her new album, Something Beautiful, on May 30th. Her ninth studio album will feature 13 original new tracks—as well as a visual film directed by Cyrus, Jacob Bixenman, and Brendan Walter, with additional cinematography by Benoît Debie.\n\nWorking with her longtime stylist Bradley Kenneth, Cyrus’s forthcoming visual album will also usher in a new fashion era for the superstar, who has always used clothing as a visual extension of her music. This time around, they wanted to fuse a classic and contemporary aesthetic. “The fashion direction is always inspired by Miley and the music,” Kenneth tells Vogue. “This era has a richness and depth that feels both modern and timeless. The looks reflect that same energy. For me, it was about translating the music through the styling into something visual and elevated.”\n\nIn Thierry Mugler Couture from spring 1997 Photo: Glen Luchford\n\nKenneth says the fashion moodboarding for the visual album began back when Cyrus was still in the recording studio. “I’ll sometimes go with her, just to listen while she’s recording, and that’s when I start imagining and dreaming up the looks,” he says. Something Beautiful had a clear cinematic focus, so Cyrus and Kenneth then zeroed in on archival fashions—pulling vintage designs from labels such as Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Bob Mackie to play up the album’s ethereal and otherworldly feel.\n\n“The looks in this project span such a wide range of fashion history,” says Kenneth. “We pulled from designers who’ve been part of Miley’s style story throughout the decade I’ve been working closely with her. Whether it’s Mackie’s drama or Mugler’s powerful silhouettes, these influences have always been there, just evolving with her.”\n\nA special component of the project was working with the team at Mugler: Cyrus and Kenneth pulled a variety of archival looks from the iconic French designer. “We actually hold the record for the largest collection of Mugler archives ever sent to a single individual, which is still surreal to say,” says Kenneth. On the album cover, for one, Cyrus sports Thierry Mugler’s “Spider” look from his spring 1997 couture “Les Insects” collection. “Manfred was inspired by the way morning dew glistens on a spiderweb,” says Kenneth. “It’s a piece that marries fragility and strength in such a beautiful way, which felt perfect for this project.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "You can always tell what stage you’re at in the dating process, based on how anxious you feel. According to my friend—let’s call her Ursula—it usually peaks somewhere around date five. “That’s the insanity phase,” she recently declared over a glass of chilled Chablis in the spring sunshine. “Because you know there’s a connection, but you’re not sure what it means yet. Like, are you exclusive? Or are you just dating? Are you coming off the apps? Or are you lining them up for 3 a.m. booty calls? And what’s the difference?”\n\nThe trouble is that, at that point, it’s still too early to have the “what are we?” conversation. “You don’t want to scare them off,” Ursula continued, fresh from a fifth date with someone she’d met in a supermarket (yes, really). “You have to do it at the right time, otherwise you could risk ruining the whole thing.”\n\nI asked what happens until the right time comes. Ursula sighed and, after taking a sizeable gulp of wine, replied: “You just go quietly mad.”\n\nIn the good old days, none of this ambiguity existed. Sure, the course of true love never did run smooth, but I’ll bet it was a hell of a lot less wriggly before the internet poisoned our brains. There was a time when dating was a straightforward process, one with clear checkboxes and benchmarks. You meet, go on a few dates, and boom: mortgage, marriage, golden retriever. That’s what my 82-year-old grandmother tells me every time I tell her I’ve met someone, anyway.\n\n“So, you’ve got a boyfriend?” she’ll ask before getting confused when I reply that I do not. “But you have a man you’re going on dates with?” Yes. “Well, why isn’t he your boyfriend?” I always try explaining it doesn’t work that way anymore, but the more I say things like, “we’re just feeling it out,” the more I feel like I’m justifying Ursula’s aforementioned state of quiet madness.\n\nDating is in desperate need of some good PR right now. Everywhere you look, there are single people in states of despair—I’m one of them. We complain about everything from the shortfall of emotionally available men to the surfeit of avoidant ones who lie to their therapists. But rarely do we talk about how dating trajectories have transformed. And according to a new study, that’s where we’ve been going wrong.",

        "title": "9 Delicious High-Protein Foods to Eat Daily",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "I find getting enough protein daily challenging. “Protein is essential for building and repairing every cell in your body,” says Ayla Barmmer, MS, RDN, LDN and founder of FullWell Fertility. “It supports the creation of enzymes and hormones, boosts immune function, and helps transport nutrients.”\n\nI know I'm not alone: Whether or not they know it, much of women in the United States are suffering from a protein deficiency. “Inadequate protein intake can have widespread negative effects on the body, impacting multiple systems and functions,” says Barmmer, listing off a host of symptoms I’m simply not interested in experiencing, including feeling weak, reduced strength, brittle hair and nails, reduced ability to fight infection or illness, and mental fog.\n\nWhen it comes to asking “how much protein do I need?” the nutritionist also shares some simple rules: If you're a sedentary adult, aim for one gram for every kilogram you weigh; if you’re an active adult, 1.6 to 2.2 grams per every kilogram you weigh; and if you’re over the age of 65, 1.2 to 1.5 grams per every kilogram you weigh. So if you weigh 165 pounds, that translates to 72.5 kilograms, so you’re aiming for around 145 grams of protein a day.\n\nPhew, this is even more intimidating than I thought. In an attempt to step up my protein game, Barmmer compiled a list of foods for me to eat as much as possible—and I’m sharing it with you. 2025 is the year of protein.\n\nFish\n\nWhen it comes to eating fish, not all have the same amount of protein. There are more than 36 varieties that the FDA declares as healthy options, and the four that are the highest when it comes to protein are tuna (24.4 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving for ahi tuna), salmon (25.92 grams in a 100-gram serving), cod (19.36 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving), and mackerel (25.45 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving).\n\nHemp Seeds\n\nThese seeds may be tiny, but they are surprisingly mighty. Two tablespoons of hemp seeds have just as much protein as two egg whites—along with all nine essential amino acids (a rarity), omega-3, and omega-6.\n\nEggs\n\n“Eggs should absolutely be part of your weekly rotation, but you want to eat the egg with the yolk,” says Barmmer. In a large egg, you’ll get about six grams of available protein. “Eggs also have a good dose of brain- and liver- and gall-bladder-supporting choline.”\n\nNut butter\n\n“While they can and should be part of your rotation, don’t expect things like peanut butter to be a significant protein source in your diet,” levels Barmmer. “They will give a small boost but it simply requires too much in terms of volume and calories to reach your protein needs with them. For example, it would take 679 calories worth of peanut butter (7 tablespoons) to equal 175 calories of a three-ounce serving of lean beef.\n\nQuinoa\n\nIf you’re gluten-free, plant-based, or on a whole foods diet, quinoa should be a big part of your diet. “This grain-like seed is one of the few complete plant protein sources providing about eight grams per cup,” says Barmmer. “It’s rich in magnesium and fiber as well.”\n\nGreek Yogurt\n\nThicker and creamier than regular yogurt because it’s fermented for longer, Greek yogurt’s health benefits far surpass the OG variety. “From a nutrition perspective, Greek yogurt typically has significantly more protein—often two times as much!—and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt,” says clinical nutritionist Heather Hodson, RDN, CDCES at NYU Langone Health. It’s also a fantastic source of calcium, which helps maintain strong bones and teeth.\n\nCottage Cheese\n\nBig on social media recently, cottage cheese is having a come back. “Just half of a cup of cottage cheese can provide between 12 and 16 grams of protein,” says Barmmer. All you need to do is read the label. “It contains casein, a slow-digesting protein that supports muscle repair and growth. It’s filling and rich in calcium.”\n\nPowders\n\nProtein powders or collagen peptides are a great addition to you diet if you're looking to up your intake. “Collagen peptides are a convenient, bioavailable, and effective way to support your body’s collagen needs, particularly as production naturally declines with age,” says Barmmer. “Adding them to your diet can help maintain youthful skin, strong joints, and overall connective tissue health.”\n\nBeef\n\n“The debate on the sustainability of beef is nuanced and requires a separate discussion, but if you can put that aside and purely look at nutrition quality, it’s really difficult to beat beef,” Barmmer says. “This is one of the most nutrient-dense sources of protein available and is a great idea to include in weekly meal plans.”",

        "content": "Since marrying Pierre Casiraghi, grandson of Grace Kelly, in 2015, Beatrice Borromeo has rarely put a foot wrong when it comes to her royal wardrobe. So it’s no surprise that the Monégasque royal pulled out all the stops for Monaco’s Rose Ball, an annual event in Monte Carlo to support the Princess Grace Foundation.\n\nIn keeping with this year’s sunset theme, Borromeo opted for a red cape dress from Dior’s spring 2020 couture collection, which she paired with Tiffany & Co. diamonds and a braided hairstyle. The gown appeared to subtly pay homage to the red caped dress that Princess Grace wore at the Red Cross Ball in 1976—a fitting tribute, given that the actress-turned-royal first founded the Rose Ball, also known as the Bal de la Rose, back in 1954, in order to raise money for her charitable foundation that supports emerging talent in theater, dance and film.\n\nBeatrice Borromeo and Charlotte Casiraghi at the 2025 Rose Ball. Photo: Getty Images\n\nBorromeo has long been a fan of Dior’s creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri—she wore a dusty-pink dress by the designer, during her and Pierpaolo Piccioli’s joint tenure at Valentino, for her civil wedding ceremony in 2015. Since Chiuri took the helm at Dior, the royal has regularly been seen on the front row at the French fashion house, which has become her go-to couturier for official events—see the scarlet Bar jacket that she wore to mark Monaco’s National Day in 2022.\n\nOf course, Borromeo was not the only member of the Monégasque royal family in attendance at this year’s Rose Ball. She was joined by her sister-in-law, Charlotte Casiraghi, who wore an embellished black dress from Chanel’s fall 2024 couture collection for the occasion.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Fresh off his Oscar win for A Royal Pain, Kieran Culkin is headlining a buzzy Broadway revival of David Mamet’s enduring classic Glengarry Glen Ross. The Pulitzer Prize-winning play, mounted in New York for the third time in 20 years, celebrated its opening night on Monday with an enthralled and star-studded crowd. Culkin, along with Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk and comedian Bill Burr, commanded the stage at the newly restored Palace Theatre playing cutthroat salesmen pushing worthless real-estate properties while dealing with greed, theft, and a general dearth of morality within their workplace.\n\nDespite heavy rain, strong wind, flashes of thunder, and flooding on the streets of Times Square, many of Culkin’s co-stars from Succession gathered to support their former colleague on his special night. Sarah Snook, who starred as Culkin’s sister Siobhan Roy, was among the first guests to arrive on the red carpet. “I really admire Kieran’s spontaneity, his imagination, and his freedom,” said Snook, accompanied by her husband, comedian Dave Lawson. “And he also doesn’t give a fuck. He’s honest and very free. He wears crazy bracelets, which is why I thought I’d wear mine tonight. Mine are from fans of The Picture of Dorian Gray, which I’m doing right now, so I thought I’d pop them on to support Kieran.”\n\nSnook takes on all 26 roles in The Picture of Dorian Gray, which had its own opening night on March 27. Culkin has visited Snook multiple times at her play to show his support, even hanging out the window of an SUV to wave to his Succession co-stars as they posed for a group photo at Dorian Gray’s opening. “When he came to the stage door the other day and said hi, it was a real oasis of calm in a sea of crazy. So of course I had to be here tonight. I didn’t text him today, but I wrote him a note on one of the Broadway faxes. On mine, he told me not to fuck it up, so I wrote a joke one as well.”\n\nDavid Rasche, who played Karl Muller, the chief financial officer of Waystar Royco on the hit HBO series, shared that the one thing he admires the most about Culkin is his side-parted hair and floppy fringe. “His hair—it always seems right,” Rasche joked. “He never has to arrange it.”",

        "title": "Want to Eat More Protein? Add This Vegetarian Food to Your List",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Say what you will, but soy is an impressively versatile vegetable. From tofu to tempeh to edamame to soy milk, the legume forms the basis for a range of foods—and it’s packed-with protein, healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins and minerals, too. It’s no wonder, then, that more and more people are giving soy a second look—regardless of whether they follow a plant-based diet or not.\n\nBut there’s one soy product that you might not know about: textured soy protein, also known as textured vegetable protein or TVP. “Although years ago it was a product intended only for vegetarians, now many people who want to improve their diets or reduce their meat consumption are incorporating it into their diet regularly,” notes nutritionist Laura Parada, who adds that it’s also extremely versatile and easy to cook.\n\nA high-protein meat alternative\n\nTextured soy protein may seem processed, but it’s actually pretty natural—it’s just the soy flour that’s leftover during the process of extracting soybean oil. “It does not contain any chemical additives or coloring,” says Parada. “Furthermore, its taste and smell are practically neutral.”\n\nMuch like tofu, textured soy protein acquires the flavor of whatever you cook it with. Unlike tofu, however, its texture is more akin to meat—which is why it’s often a main ingredient in many meat alternatives like faux chicken nuggets or meat-free burgers. “It is very similar in texture and can be formed into different shapes—crumbles, fillets, strips, and patties,” says Parada, who notes that since it’s often sold in its dehydrated form it’s an excellent item to keep on-hand in the pantry.\n\nIt’s also high in nutritional value: “Textured soy protein offers a high content of high quality protein with less fat than animal products,” says Parada. “Each cup of dehydrated soy protein provides approximately 48 g of protein and 300 calories, making it a light and highly satiating option.”\n\nThe nutritional benefits of textured soy protein\n\nAlthough its high protein content is reason enough to add it to your dietary rotation, textured soy also provides a healthy dose of essential vitamins and minerals, including “calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, and B vitamins,” says Parada. “It is also rich in lecithin, a substance that assists the absorbtion of vitamins in the body.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "We’re all pretty much aware by now that the planes are not all right, but this weekend, I came across an in-flight horror story that genuinely made my jaw drop. Last week, a female CEO sued American Airlines for negligence, discrimination, and intentional infliction of emotional distress after a male passenger seated next to her in first class began masturbating during their eight-hour flight to Milan. Even worse, upon bringing his behavior to the attention of a flight attendant, she was allegedly dismissed and told “men just do stuff like that.” (Yeah, you know men! They’re always brazenly doing sex crimes! It’s totally fine and not a big deal! You’re the one who’s weird for having a problem with it, actually!)\n\nIt sounds about right that the woman was then told by gate staff to simply “call the 1-800 number” once she landed; I’m pretty sure that a serial-murder rampage could take place on a flight, and you’d be given exactly the same guidance. (Delta Airlines, I still hate you so much for sending my bag to the wrong destination, telling me to call the 1-800 number, then YELLING AT ME when I was flying home to a still-on-fire city in January! I’m glad I raised my voice in return!)\n\nObviously, this CEO’s ordeal is a pretty extreme example of just how bad flight etiquette has become over the last decade or so, and especially since the pandemic. But it’s also making me wonder: Are there any rules in the air anymore? I’ll be flying from Los Angeles to New York in May, and even if the plane lands safely and nobody jerks off near me, I know I’ll still have to deal with the kind of noxious plane behavior that seems to have become de rigueur these days, from passengers watching stuff on their iPhones without headphones to grown adults being so rude about the presence of small children on their commercial aircraft that said kids’ parents feel pressured to hand out gift bags. (If you’ve never desperately tried to entertain a small, angry person on what basically amounts to a hissing germ tube, I don’t want to hear your opinion on the kids-on-planes debate!)\n\nI’m not saying that I expect the Don Draper-drinking-martinis-and-kissing-stewardesses treatment when I fly, of course; as a fat person and a longtime devotee of Spirit Airlines, I’m pretty used to being uncomfortable, if not actively humiliated, when traveling by plane. (Did you know that the average amount of legroom on even a non-Spirit airline has been steadily shrinking over the past few decades?)",

        "content": "“What is that?”\n\nIt’s a regular Tuesday night after work, and I am perusing the pasta assortment of my local grocery store while nonchalantly carrying Moschino’s fall 2025 pasta bag. (Well, that is a slight lie: I am trying to be noticed.) “Oh, this?,” I reply to the complete stranger who has approached me about the campy (okay, quite bizarre) accessory that I am toting under my arm. “It’s actually a clutch!” At first glance, it does indeed look like I have a mountain of loose spaghetti coming out of my armpit. So when I reveal that it is actually a luxuriously-made handbag, said stranger proceeds to smile in a slightly horrified way—then slowly rolls their cart away from the crazy man in aisle two.\n\nIf you, like me, love fashion and pasta, then Moschino’s spaghetti bag is sure to delight the senses. (Don’t try eating it, though.) Debuted at the Italian label’s fall show in Milan back in February, the clutch—designed by creative director Adrian Appiolaza—is made of printed leather, punctuated with strands of dynamic, faux-leather noodles. There’s even basil leaves and cherry tomatoes all tangled up in it, too. “I have so much fun with all the bags I design for Moschino, but this pasta bag with cherry tomatoes is a particular favorite,” Appiolaza says of his new creation. “A classic clutch mixed with spaghetti pomodoro is such a playful and cheeky way to wear your favorite dish.”\n\nMoschino’s spaghetti bag wasn’t the only Italian food-themed accessory in the show: There were also Milano lemon cookie bags, and clutches shaped into bottles of Moschino wine. But the stringy pasta version is by far the most intricate and over-the-top offering of the bunch: It will soon retail for $3,250, and becomes available later this summer. Of it, Appiolaza quips, “carbs have never looked so good!”\n\nSure, a wacky runway bag is nothing new for Moschino, given the Italian fashion house’s legacy spans everything from McDonalds-inspired crossbodies to, more recently, the celery-shaped leather Sedano bag. But there is something about the pasta bag that particularly lends itself to a riotous night out. Would fashion set in the image of carbs invigorate some all-night dancing? Would it set the tone for a delicious evening? Feeling inspired, I decided to bravely take the pasta bag on a hot date—to two of New York’s sceniest restaurants, The Corner Store and Cipriani Downtown—as well as my local grocery store.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen people come in, right, with, they come in like this,\n\nI definitely feel like you're gonna get my whole lash\n\nand people have.\n\nAgain, look at the mouth open.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHourglass, baby!\n\nIt's translucent tan.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nAlso, I think I bought 57 of these,\n\n5711 of these from Costco.\n\nSecond to the last, Sakura.\n\nIt's so light, but like hmm,\n\nthat's a ranch [indistinct], like it's so good.\n\nThe last thing and this is my favorite,\n\nwell, one of my favorite products from my line,\n\nit's the Styling Glaze\n\nwhere I could have just done with my finger, but.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\nI hope you learned a little something more about me,\n\nthe products that I use.\n\nAnd I hope you have a great day.\n\nI will.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Paris, 1978. Elaine Sciolino was a 29-year-old cub reporter for Newsweek, the junior member, and only woman, in a bureau staffed by much older men. For assignments, she got the leftovers—“soft” stuff, which in Paris mostly meant food and fashion. Newsweek happened to share an office with The Washington Post, and Sciolino’s first break came when the paper’s legendary fashion editor Nina Hyde took her under her wing. Soon she was attending prêt-à-porter shows, meeting Yves Saint Laurent and his model muses, dining at Karl Lagerfeld’s stunning Left Bank apartment. It was a glamorous introduction to journalism in the City of Light.\n\nThen, her beat changed overnight. An obscure Iranian cleric named Ruhollah Khomeini arrived in the quiet suburb of Neauphle-le-Château in exile, and none of the senior correspondents wanted to make the trek. But Sciolino was game. Armed with charm, persistence, and chutzpah, she became the first woman—and first American—to interview the ayatollah. When the revolution erupted in Tehran, Newsweek chose her to board Khomeini’s chartered flight back to Iran. She took with her $20,000 in cash, a shortwave radio, a portable typewriter in a blue eggshell case, and one change of clothing.\n\n“I was young and foolish and single,” she later told Terry Gross, reflecting on the dangers she brushed off as a woman journalist flying into the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSciolino eventually joined The New York Times, where she built a distinguished career as United Nations bureau chief, CIA correspondent, and the paper’s first female chief diplomatic correspondent, among other roles. She later returned to Paris, this time to lead the Times bureau there during the George W. Bush years—the era of “Freedom Fries.” Yet Paris was no longer just a professional assignment; it would become her permanent home, and the throughline of her next four books.\n\nThe first was 2011’s La Séduction, a sharp analysis of how seduction—not merely romantic but also intellectual, culinary, and political —infuses nearly every aspect of French life. While plenty of Americans have written about what the French can teach us (Bringing Up Bébé, French Women Don’t Get Fat, etc.), Sciolino’s was that rare book written by an American that French people could read to understand themselves. She followed up its success with a bestselling portrait of her own street, the Rue des Martyrs (2015’s The Only Street in Paris), and 2019’s The Seine: The River That Made Paris, tracing the river from its mythical beginnings as a wellspring of Gallic culture to its unlikely future as an Olympic swimming venue.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Once seen as youthful and sickeningly sweet, the best gourmand fragrances have evolved into sophisticated, gender-inclusive scents that appeal to virtually everyone—no matter their age or fragrance style. Modern formulations are layered, sophisticated, and often unexpected. “The trend began over a year ago and we haven’t seen it slow down,” shares Autumne West, Nordstrom’s national beauty director. “We’re also seeing a surge of lavender, which some may view as floral, but it’s also a gourmand when we think of lavender-flavored foods.”\n\nVogue’s Favorite Gourmand Perfumes:\n\nIn This Article:\n\nThe shift toward more complex scents is evident in the way fragrance houses are reinterpreting gourmand notes. The bestselling perfumes today incorporate unconventional ingredients to create a more nuanced, adult take on sweetness. Delphine Jelk, Guerlain’s in-house perfumer, attributes this evolution to a growing desire for more refined compositions. “Gourmands have become more elegant and less childish.” While vanilla remains a staple, she highlights that “honey, nutty, and milk fragrances” are gaining traction with “mouthwatering fruity notes” also on the rise.\n\nYvan Jacqueline, President of Parfums de Marly and Initio Parfums Privés, confirms that today’s gourmand fragrances are increasingly shifting toward unisex or gender-neutral offerings. He says, “There’s a greater push toward unisex or gender-neutral gourmands, which focus on more universal themes of indulgence and comfort rather than leaning into traditionally feminine or masculine qualities.”\n\nIf it seems like everywhere you go—from the office to a stylish art gallery opening to the chic new rooftop bar—smells undeniably delicious, your senses aren’t deceiving you. Indulgent, food-inspired fragrances are here to stay. “Gourmands have surged as fragrance lovers are adding more to their personal collections and not just wearing one signature scent,” notes Linda Levy, president of The Fragrance Foundation. She also attributes their rise to their ability to evoke nostalgia and comfort.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, it's Simone Ashley\n\nand I'm gonna be showing you a little bit of my skincare\n\nand a very simple date night look.\n\nSo I'm just gonna clip my hair away.\n\nI like to use my La Mer cleansing gel.\n\nAs you can see, it's nearly finished.\n\nThat's because I love it so much\n\nand I used just a teeny tiny amount.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI never grew up doing much of a skincare routine.\n\nI always took care of my skin,\n\nbut everything I do, I really like to do it simply.\n\nOtherwise I feel like I'm like overloading my face\n\nand my skin with products.\n\nI had my first skin facial, like back in 2021\n\nand then I was, you know, transitioned to the dark side ll\n\nand I realized how great it is to take care of your skin.\n\nI was very naive and I thought\n\nbecause I have dark skin, I didn't need to use sunscreen,\n\nwhich I think a lot of women with dark skin might feel.\n\nDark skin needs some protection\n\njust as much as any other skin.\n\nI love to use an exfoliator on my face.\n\nThis one is Goldfaden.\n\nI dunno why I say McFaden. [laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nI can't be a Bon Jovi without good Italian food.\n\n[gentle elegant music]\n\nHi, everyone, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand I am with Vogue today\n\nto serve not only a look, but actually a meal.\n\nI'm wearing a Dolce Archive.\n\nWho? Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella. I'm gonna start in the middle.\n\nWhy not?\n\nNow I'm going to put a little bit of parsley.\n\nNot one flake went on there.\n\nA little lemon and voila, that is my paella.\n\nWow. I'm getting hints of saffron.\n\nI'm getting hints of tomato. This is delicious.\n\nGood job me.\n\nIt's all working. It's all giving.\n\nIt's all serving.\n\nMy kitchen at home does not look like this.\n\nAnd it usually has around 10 dogs running around me,\n\neating everything that falls on the ground.\n\nIt's just been a really peaceful, enjoyable experience.\n\nI love limes. You know, and Dakota's like, I love limes.\n\nI would like to take this home in memory\n\nof that amazing video.\n\nThanks so much for watching. Bye.\n\nI have a nephew and I perform popular to him.\n\nHe fully giggles and laughs\n\nat me playing Elphaba and Glinda for him.\n\nHe loves the power of Elphaba.\n\nLike he can really...\n\nHe feels it, but Glinda makes him laugh.\n\n[upbeat bright music]",
