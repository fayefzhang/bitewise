In the self-evident truth that all people are created equal, all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less,\" Judge Reyes wrote.\n\nThe ruling came as part of Talbott vs. Trump, a lawsuit filed on Jan. 28 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by LGBTQ+ advocacy groups Glad Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of six active duty transgender service members.\n\nAnticipating the Trump administration's appeal, Reyes delayed her decision from taking effect until Friday so the Department of Justice could ask a higher court to stay her order.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to appeal the ruling.\n\n\"We are appealing this decision, and we will win,\" he posted.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday morning following the judge's ruling, 2nd Lt. Nicholas Talbott and Maj. Erica Vandal, both plaintiffs in the lawsuit, expressed relief and said they look forward to continuing to serve their country.\n\n\"[This preliminary injunction] has provided immense relief for myself and my family, personally, along with the numerous others impacted,\" Vandal said. \"It's a massive burden lifted knowing that I can continue to provide for my wife and two children, while continuing my career and lifelong passion as a field artillery officer.\"\n\nLt. Talbott, a platoon leader in the U.S. Army Reserve, said that the ruling is a \"tremendous step forward\" and a \"breath of fresh air.\"\n\n\"Transgender service members are just as qualified, competent and dedicated as any other military member, and we are thrilled to be able to continue to put on our uniforms and perform the jobs we have worked so hard for in service of our country,\" Talbott said.\n\nTalbott said he is “confident” that the court will “continue to find that transgender people have no negative bearing on the United States military.”\n\nIn an interview later with ABC News Live, Talbott said, \"For me, it has been like a huge weight is suddenly lifted off my shoulders. Now I can get back to focusing solely on the mission at hand … and continuing to serve my country.\"\n\nA Defense Department memo last month said the Pentagon will be required to form a procedure to identify transgender troops by March 26 and separate them from the military by June 25, unless they receive an exemption. This includes service members receiving some form of treatment or hormones for that diagnosis of gender dysphoria, as well as those who have gone through a gender-affirming surgery.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs two executive orders and speaks to the press in the Oval Office of the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Reyes, the Trump administration failed to justify the policy by articulating its impact on military readiness, harmed thousands of transgender service members, and likely violated the United States Constitution.\n\n\"The President has the power—indeed the obligation—to ensure military readiness. At times, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons the privilege of serving,\" Reyes wrote.\n\n\"[Fill in the blank] is not fully capable and will hinder combat effectiveness; [fill in the blank] will disrupt unit cohesion and so diminish military effectiveness; allowing [fill in the blank] to serve will undermine training, make it impossible to recruit successfully, and disrupt military order,\" she added. \"First minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank. Today, however, our military is stronger and our Nation is safer for the millions of such blanks (and all other persons) who serve.\"\n\nWhile the judge acknowledged that the judiciary should generally defer to military leadership, she said that permitting the policy to be enforced would be her following the Pentagon \"blindly\" after it justified the policy with \"pure conjecture\" during multiple court hearings.\n\n\"The Court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes. We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect. For, as Elmer Davis observed, '[t]his nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.' The Court extends its appreciation to every current servicemember and veteran. Thank you,\" the judge concluded her opinion.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller responded to the judge's order on X Tuesday night, saying, \"District court judges have now decided they are in command of the Armed Forces…is there no end to this madness?\"\n\nJennifer Levi and Shannon Minter, attorneys representing the plaintiffs in Talbott. vs Trump, welcomed the preliminary injunction during the press conference on Wednesday.\n\nMinter said he is hopeful that as the case moves forward, it will result in a \"permanent injunction,\" because the \"legal basis of the decision is so strong.\"\n\nLevi said that while the Trump administration could seek an emergency stay, she is \"hopeful\" that the judge would deny it.\n\n\"We anticipate that [the Trump administration] may appeal this, they may seek an emergency stay to try to get emergency relief. I think I'm hopeful that that won't happen,\" Levi said. \"But I think the easier course, really, for the military at this point, is to continue to preserve these people in active service and let them continue to do their jobs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Talbott and Vandal acknowledged that the fight is not over.\n\n\"Ultimately, the relief I feel at this time is tempered by the knowledge that this fight is far from over,\" Vandal said.\n\n\"We are ready, and we are going to continue to show up every single day, put on our uniforms and do the absolute best that we can,\" Talbott added.\n\nThere are currently 4,240 active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a defense official previously told ABC News.",

        "content": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Two blocks from the Alabama Statehouse, a black wreath hung on the door of Adams Drugs — a symbol to draw attention to the number of neighborhood pharmacies that have closed, or are in danger of closing, across the state.\n\nDozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\n“We’re losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,” Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said.\n\nAlabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.\n\nLegislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.\n\n“The biggest issue is we’re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,” Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.\n\nThe Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing” where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.\n\nGroups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.\n\nHelena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.\n\n“Shifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,” Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Sen. Andrew Jones, a cosponsor of the bill, said Thursday said other states have seen drug prices go down. Jones said it is important to protect neighborhood pharmacies because they play a vital role in communities.\n\n“You are not going to get a big box store to open in the middle of the night to get you the medication you need,” Jones said.",

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump’s shoot-from-the-lip style kept Americans on the edge of their seats during last year's campaign. But now that he's speaking as a president and not as a candidate, his words are being used against him in court in the blizzard of litigation challenging his agenda.\n\nThe spontaneity is complicating his administration's legal positions. Nowhere has this been clearer than in cases involving his adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the driving force in his efforts to downsize and overhaul the federal government.\n\nThe latest example came earlier this week when U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled that Musk had likely violated the Constitution by dismantling the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nThe lawsuit turned on the question of whether the billionaire entrepreneur had overstepped his authority. Justice Department lawyers and White House officials insist that Musk is merely a presidential adviser, not the actual leader of DOGE.\n\nBut Trump has said otherwise — in speeches, interviews and public remarks — and Chuang quoted him extensively in his decision.\n\nTrump most notably boasted of creating DOGE during his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress and said it was “headed by Elon Musk.\" Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation, and he saluted from the gallery above the House chamber.\n\n“Trump’s words were essential, central and indispensable,” said Norm Eisen, one of the lawyers for USAID employees who filed the lawsuit. “His admissions took what would have been a tough case and made it into a straightforward one.”\n\nThe looseness with words is a shift from predecessors like Democratic President Barack Obama, who used to say that he was careful because anything he said could send troops marching or markets tumbling.\n\nTrump has no such feeling of restraint, and neither do other members of his Republican administration such as Musk.\n\nChuang, who is based in Maryland and was nominated by Obama, also cited social media posts from Musk, who writes frequently on X, the platform that he owns.\n\nFor example, Musk posted “we spent the weekend feeding USAID to the woodchipper” on Feb. 3. The agency was being brought to a standstill at that time, with staff furloughed, spending halted and headquarters shut down.\n\n\"Musk’s public statements and posts ... suggest that he has the ability to cause DOGE to act,\" Chuang wrote in his ruling.\n\nHarrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said Trump was fulfilling his campaign promise “to make the federal government more efficient and accountable to taxpayers.”\n\n“Rogue bureaucrats and activist judges attempting to undermine this effort are only subverting the will of the American people and their obstructionist efforts will fail,” he said.\n\nAnthony Coley, who led public affairs at the Justice Department during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, said statements involving civil litigation were always coordinated between his office and the West Wing.\n\n“The words could be used to support what we’re doing or undermine what we’re doing,” he said. “It’s a carefully choreographed effort to make sure there was no daylight between what was said in the court of public opinion and what could ultimately play out in the court of law.”\n\nIn comparison to how things were done in the past, Coley said, Trump has a “ready-fire-aim approach of doing business.”\n\nTrump doesn't usually let legal disputes force him to turn down the volume. During a criminal investigation over his decision to keep classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving the White House in 2021, Trump spoke extensively about the case in an interview with Fox News.\n\nLongtime defense lawyers were startled because defendants are usually encouraged to keep mum while facing an indictment. But the situation panned out for Trump. His legal team delayed the case, and the special counsel's office dropped the charges after Trump won the election last November — presidents can't be prosecuted while in office.\n\nDOGE has been the focus of nearly two dozen lawsuits. It's often prevailed so far in cases involving access to government data, where several plaintiffs have struggled to convince judges to block the organization's actions.\n\nBut it's also run into challenges, such as a lawsuit over whether DOGE must comply with public records requests. The Trump administration asserted in court that DOGE is part of the White House, meaning it's exempt.\n\nJudge Christopher Cooper, also nominated by Obama, disagreed, siding with a government watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.\n\n“Musk and the President’s public statements indicate that USDS\" — the original acronym for the organization that was renamed as DOGE — \"is in fact exercising substantial independent authority,” wrote Cooper, who is based in Washington.\n\nCooper concluded that DOGE can \"identify and terminate federal employees, federal programs, and federal contracts. Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does.”\n\nHe ordered DOGE to start responding to requests about the team’s role in mass firings and disruptions to federal programs. The administration unsuccessfully asked the judge to reconsider, saying the judge “fundamentally misapprehended” the agency's structure.\n\nThe cases are still in their early stages, and the novel legal questions they're raising will take time for the courts to consider, said Michael Fragoso, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and former chief counsel to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n“What Elon does on Twitter is not necessarily what DOGE does,” he said. “My hope would be courts take the time to sift between those two.”\n\nJust because Musk claims credit online for deep agency cuts, that doesn’t necessarily translate to DOGE having authority in the eyes of the law, Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell argued in a recent debate on the issue.\n\nDOGE is recommending changes, he said, but it’s the agency heads who are actually putting them into effect.\n\n“And that’s all that the courts are going to care about as to what the Supreme Court is going to do,” McConnell said at the debate hosted by the National Constitution Center.",

The buyer was not identified.

There were 91 in the first year in 2023 and 251 last year.\n\nWhile the cards have attracted the attention of some young major leaguers and longtime collectors alike, most of the attention has been focused on Skenes' card in particular.\n\nA combination of Skenes’ burgeoning stardom, the considerable reach of his girlfriend, LSU gymnast/influencer Livvy Dunne and a head-turning offer the Pirates made in hopes of securing the card fueled the hype for the one-of-one collectible.\n\nIt was claimed by an 11-year-old in the Los Angeles area after he discovered the redemption code for the Skenes card in a pack he received as part of a Christmas present. He declined the Pirates’ offer and instead turned over the card to Fanatics Collect, which has given it the “white glove” service for the last two months.\n\nSkenes was voted the National League Rookie of the Year after he went 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA in 23 starts for Pittsburgh last year.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.\n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.\n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.\"\n\nBooker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.\n\n\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nThere's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a “Choose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.\n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.”\n\n“I didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video.\n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.\n\nSome of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.\n\n“We want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don’t have Democrats on there,” said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. “The ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that’s not typical for the Democratic base.”\n\nSome House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don’t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.\n\n“I think there’s a fine line before we’re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.\n\n“When it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing ‘get ready with me’ videos. It would look super cringe. But I’m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,” said Jacobs.\n\nSome Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it’s communicated on.\n\n“If you know how to talk to people, it doesn’t matter what medium is going to exist,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. “You could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don’t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn’t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it’s just not going to translate.”",

While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time,\" Met Police said in a statement. \"Given the location of the sub-station and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries.\"\n\nAs many as 290,000 passengers could be impacted by the closure Friday, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company.

It would take 60 \"yes\" votes in the Senate to overcome the filibuster and dismantle the department that Congress created.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an Education event and signs executive orders in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"The Department of Education will be much smaller than it is today,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday, noting the department will not be completely shut down yet and that it will continue to carry out \"critical functions.\"\n\n\"But we don't need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that's clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students,\" she said.\n\nTrump is directing McMahon to take \"all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States,\" the order said, and he added in the ceremony that he hopes she will be the last secretary of the department.\n\nThe order also calls for the \"uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\" It's still unclear how the administration plans to accomplish that. Sources said the administration has been looking into how to move some of the key programs to other agencies.\n\nRepublican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Greg Abbott of Texas, Mike Braun of Indiana, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jeff Landry of Louisiana and Mike DeWine of Ohio were among the state leaders attending the signing ceremony.\n\n\"We want to return our students to the states, where just some of the governors here are so happy about this,\" Trump said. \"They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states, and they're going to do a phenomenal job.\"\n\nHowever, several Democrats and education advocates slammed the order.\n\n\"This is a code red for every public school student, parent and teacher in this country,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said. \"Trump is telling public school kids in America that their futures don't matter. Billionaires like Trump and Musk won't feel the difference when after school programs are slashed, class sizes go up and help for families to pay for school gets cut. But working families, students, and teachers will pay a heavy price.\"\n\n\"Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation's public schools, their families and hardworking teachers,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a Thursday statement. \"Congress created the Department of Education and only an act of Congress can eliminate it. We will stop this malignant Republican scheme in the House of Representatives and in the Courts.\"\n\nHouse Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., said the order will cause \"irreparable harm\" to students and educators.\n\n\"By dismantling ED, President Trump is implementing his own philosophy on education which can be summed up in his own words, 'I love the poorly educated,'\" he added.\n\nThe department took the first steps to downsize last week when it laid off nearly half its employees, and it shrunk significantly in size through a massive reduction in force, deferred resignations and retirement buyouts, according to the department.\n\nCivil servants and supporters of the Department of Education rally outside the department in Washington, Mar. 11, 2025. Jim Lo Scalzo/epa-efe/shuttersto/JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/Shuttersto\n\nTrump is continuing the reforms with his order -- pledging to erase more staff from the department.\n\n\"I expect it will [be shut down entirely],\" Trump said on \"Full Measure\" with Sharyl Attkisson earlier this month. \"You'll have a few people left just to make sure [the states are] teaching English -- you know, you say reading, writing and arithmetic.\"\n\nLinda McMahon, President Trump's nominee to be secretary of Education, testifies before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 13, 2025. Tierney L Cross/Reuters\n\nCritics argue the department is needed for vital financial assistance and grant programs. Education experts suggested that shuttering the Department of Education could gut public education funding and disproportionately affect high-need students across the country who rely on statutorily authorized programs, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title 1, which provides funding for low-income families.\n\nThese programs could be housed in a reformed, shrunken-down Department of Education or other agencies, and McMahon said the department will still administer those statutory programs that students from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on. In an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" McMahon suggested the \"good\" employees who administer the statutorily mandated functions will not be harmed by staff reductions.\n\n\"Legality aside, dismantling ED will exacerbate existing disparities, reduce accountability and put low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities and rural students at risk,\" Scott said.\n\nA statement from the department said it will \"continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\"\n\n\"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them,\" Trump said Thursday. \"But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department.\"\n\nHowever, some critics noted that the department does more than administer funding of key programs.\n\n\"The department does more than disperse funds,\" Agency CEO and public education advocate Debbie Veney said. \"It ensures accountability, enforces civil rights protections and upholds educational standards. Eliminating it would weaken oversight and put millions of students at risk.\"\n\n\"Instead of dismantling a vital institution, leaders should focus on strengthening education policies that support students, families and schools,\" she added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order to shut down the Department of Education, during an event in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nThe National Parents Union also condemned the order as unconstitutional and said students will suffer from a lack of a federal Department of Education.\n\n\"Let's call this what it is: An assault on our kids' future and playing chicken with a constitutional crisis with the willful disregard of Congressional authority,\" it said in a statement. \"This isn't fixing education. It's making sure millions of children never get a fair shot. And we're not about to let that happen without a fight.\"\n\nStill, some school advocates said Trump's order did not go far enough, with American Federation for Children CEO Tommy Schultz saying Trump has \"brought down a failed bureaucratic machine in DC.\"\n\n\"With this executive order, President Trump continues taking steps to fulfill his campaign promises on education, and now it is time for Congress to send school choice legislation to his desk so that he can fulfill his other mandate to the voters,\" he said.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds an executive order after signing it alongside Secretary of Education Linda McMahon (R) in the East Room of the White house in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nIn more than four decades, Trump and Department of Education skeptics have said they believe the agency has had too much spending power without achieving results.\n\nAfter McMahon was sworn in, she underscored that abolishing the department is rooted in allowing families the right to choose a \"quality education\" so America's students aren't \"stuck in failing schools.\"\n\n\"This is also, I would say, a national security issue,\" Leavitt added Thursday morning. \"When you look at how students around the world, particularly in China, are being educated, American students are falling behind. We're not keeping up with our allies or our adversaries, and that's a major problem for our country, and the president is fixing it today.\"\n\nAfter Trump signed the bill, House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg said McMahon \"understands the importance of getting the federal government out of the way.\"\n\n\"Bottom line, the Department of Education has failed to deliver results for America's students and today's actions by the Trump administration will help ensure our nation's youth are put first,\" he added.",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy says the country risks drifting toward authoritarianism if the executive branch isn't brought under control\n\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy received applause at a Thursday town hall in Salt Lake City when she told the crowd she’s concerned about the country drifting toward authoritarianism “if we don’t get the executive branch under control.”\n\nBut the cheers turned to boos when she added those worries weren't specific to Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n“When Biden was president, I had the same concern,\" she said, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nMaloy's comments summed up her careful approach to criticizing Trump throughout the event, which she held with Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Kennedy. The Utah lawmakers are among a handful of Republicans who have held public meetings against the recommendation of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who encouraged them to skip out after others drew protesters.\n\nThe boisterous audience in liberal Salt Lake City repeatedly urged Maloy to denounce Trump’s sweeping federal budget cuts. Maloy wields power over federal funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. She and Kennedy said they opposed some of the administration's cuts, including to the National Park Service. But Maloy also said tough spending decisions are necessary.\n\n“We are not going to get out of the situation we’re in financially without all of us feeling some pain,” she said.\n\nMaloy said she and Kennedy held the town hall because they believed Utah could set an example on how to hold civil discussions about tough issues. Questions were sent in to a message board and attendees could vote for those they were most interested in hearing. The question about authoritarianism came from a man who stood up and shouted it.\n\nTo jeers from the crowd, Kennedy defended Trump’s actions in his first three months in the White House, including the president's move to end foreign aid contracts at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n“We need to make sure that our own house is in order,\" he said. “We’re spending money off in foreign lands on things that may or may not be meritorious. In this case, our grandchildren will be paying back with economic disaster.”\n\nMaloy took a more tepid approach, telling the crowd she sees a need for more checks on the executive branch as Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders.\n\nShe said she called the White House to express concern about an order that directed federal agencies to lay off hundreds of thousands of probationary employees. Judges recently ordered the workers to be rehired. She said she supports broad efforts to shrink the size and scope of the federal government but thinks the mass firing of probationary workers was the wrong approach.\n\nMany questions focused on how federal budget cuts might impact Utah's vast public lands, including its five national parks. Both lawmakers said they opposed the Trump administration's reductions of National Park Service staff, but that they had little power to influence his decisions. Some jobs have been restored.\n\nMaloy, who lives just north of Zion National Park, began her career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, working to conserve natural resources, improve water quality and manage nutrients in the farmlands of southwest Utah. In Congress, she has served on subcommittees focusing on water resources and rural development. Her district includes many rural towns known for outdoor recreation.\n\nKennedy is a family doctor and former state senator. His district spans the entire eastern border of the state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub of Moab.\n\nVoters from both parties said after the town hall they had hoped to hear more about Social Security. Dozens of the program’s offices across the country are slated to close due to actions taken by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nNot everyone in the crowd opposed Trump's actions. Andrew Turner, a 30-year-old Republican and engineering student, said he wished the lawmakers had more time to address the future of Social Security and criticized the audience for talking over Maloy and Kennedy as they tried to answer questions.\n\n“Something will have to be done about Social Security because otherwise it’s going to collapse,” he said. “I know as somebody who’s younger, at the current trajectory, I’m probably not going to be able to use the program. So I support the budget cuts Trump is doing.”",

The SEC had appealed that ruling.\n\nRipple's appeal of the $125 million fine was still pending as of Wednesday.\n\nFollowing Garlinghouse's announcement of the SEC dropping its appeal, the price of XRP surged more than 10% on Wednesday.\n\nIn his video statement on X, Garlinghouse called the case again him \"lawfare\" and praised the change in government.\n\n\"Thankfully, we have new leadership in the executive and legislative branches of our government,\" he said. \"That leadership is actively seeking a rational and constructive way forward on crypto.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)\n\nBEIJING -- U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, is visiting Beijing as the U.S. and China swap tariff threats and harsh words over each others' handling of the illegal trade in fentanyl.\n\nDaines, a Republican from Montana, arrived in the Chinese capital on Thursday after meeting top leaders in Vietnam, according to social media posts by him and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.\n\nHe said on X earlier this week that he would be talking with Chinese officials about curbing the production and distribution of fentanyl and “the need to reduce the trade deficit and ensure fair market access for our Montana farmers, ranchers and producers.”\n\nHis office said ahead of the trip that he is coordinating closely with the White House and will be “carrying President Trump's America First agenda.\"\n\nDaines previously worked as an executive for U.S. companies in China and served as a go-between during Trump's first term in office when tariffs were also a major issue. He is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January.\n\nU.S.-China tensions have spiked as the U.S. imposed 20% duties on Chinese goods, drawing retaliatory tariffs of 15% on U.S. farm goods from China this past week. The U.S. accuses China of doing too little to stop the export of precursor materials for fentanyl, a highly potent opiate blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.\n\nChina responded with a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China, and the foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing’s goodwill with tariffs.\n\nThe report said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nChina is committed to cooperation, the report said, “but firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.”",

(Orbetello Fishermen 's Cooperative via AP, HO)\n\nROME -- Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.\n\nMillions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.\n\nFishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.\n\nOn Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.\n\nA permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to “protect citizens and economic activities in the area,” Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.\n\nLocal residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition “Save the Orbetello Lagoon” had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.\n\n“We cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.\n\nPier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.\n\n“Everything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,” he warned.",

(AP Photo/Morgan Lee, File)\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. -- A bill that would create a “turquoise” safety alert system for missing Native American people in New Mexico has been endorsed by the Legislature.\n\nA vote of the state Senate without opposition Thursday sent the rapid response initiative to New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who supports the proposal.\n\nThe bill responds to a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country — and would allow law enforcement to quickly share information about Native Americans who go missing.\n\nThe “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — would function much like existing “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly. Cellphone alerts would be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American.\n\n“I carry with me countless stories of how our system has failed to respond to the disappearance or murder of Native people in our state,” said Democratic state Sen. Angel Charley of Acoma Pueblo, a co-sponsor of the bill. “We have answered the call.”\n\nCalifornia, Washington and Colorado have similar alert systems, according to the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs. Arizona lawmakers are considering their own alert system as the brutal death of San Carlos Apache teenager Emily Pike reverberates through Native American communities.\n\nNew Mexico has 23 federally recognized tribes, including large portions of the Navajo Nation, as well as land holdings of the Fort Sill Apache.\n\nThe safety and concerns of those communities were on prominent display during a 60-day legislative session that ends Saturday at noon.\n\nA bill signed Wednesday by Lujan Grisham ensures students can wear their own Native American regalia at graduation and other school ceremonies in the spirit of free expression linked to cultural heritage.",

We succeeded in obtaining the release of an American citizen, Georg Glezmann, after two years in detention in Kabul,\" former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad posted on X following his release. \"The Taliban government agreed to free him as a goodwill gesture to @POTUS and the American people. George is on his way home to his family.\"\n\nTaliban foreign affairs office posted on X that U.S. and Taliban officials met in Afghanistan on Thursday and discussed \"bilateral relations\" and \"positive economic relations\" as they negotiated the release of Glezmann.\n\nGlezmann has arrived in Doha, Qatar, per the Qatari government, and is travelling with Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's special envoy for hostage response, and is likely to arrive back in the United States on Friday, according to a U.S. official, though the plans could change.\n\n\"I can't wait to see George and help him on his road to recovery as we rebuild our lives,\" Glezmann's wife told WSB. \"We are forever grateful to President Trump for bringing George home.\"",

Boasberg ordered that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting the alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador. Officials failed to turn those flights around.\n\nThe Trump administration has not yet released the names of the alleged gang members who were deported.\n\nIn this March 16, 2023, file photo, Judge James E.

She had 1,422 hours of flying total, which is below the Federal Aviation Administration minimum to be a commercial pilot.\n\nInvestigators examine the wreckage of a Delta Air Lines plane a day after it crashed on landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario, Feb. 18, 2025.

The first officer, who was flying the plane, pulled back the thrust levers to decrease engine thrust.\n\nThen, 2.6 seconds before touchdown, the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System alert \"sink rate\" went off, indicating a high rate of descent, according to the report.\n\nLess than one second before touchdown, the aircraft's indicated airspeed was 134 knots and its groundspeed was 11 knots, per the report. The bank angle was 7.1 degrees to the right, and the pitch attitude was 1 degree nose up. The rate of descent was recorded as 1,110 feet per minute, according to the report.\n\nWhat happened during touchdown?\n\nThe side stay attached to the aircraft's right main landing gear fractured on landing, according to the report, while the landing gear retracted.\n\nThe wing root fractured between landing gear and fuselage, causing the right wing to release a \"cloud of jet fuel\" when it detached from the fuselage, according to the report, which then caught fire when the aircraft was sliding on the runway.\n\nThe report also revealed the cockpit door was jammed shut and the flight crew exited the plane through the emergency hatch on the ceiling of the cockpit.\n\nInvestigators with Canada's Transportation Safety Board view the wreckage of a Delta Air Lines operated CRJ-900 aircraft lies crashed on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, Feb. 18, 2025.

Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia via Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration expanded the use of the CBP One phone application to allow migrants to submit some background information and schedule appointments with immigration officials at ports of entry. Officials would then determine if the person could be allowed into the country, some in order to submit an asylum claim. President Donald Trump eliminated that feature during his first days in office.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has accused Barrios of having a gang-affiliated tattoo and claimed a photo of him showed him displaying gang signs.\n\nThe tattoo in question showed a crown sitting on top of a soccer ball with a rosary and the word \"Dios\" (God), according to Tobin. A declaration from the tattoo artist confirmed that Barrios chose it because it was similar to the Real Madrid soccer team logo, the attorney said. According to Tobin, those alleged gang signs were the hand symbol for rock and roll and \"I love you\" in sign language.\n\nTobin also said she submitted records from Venezuela that indicated Barrios had no criminal record in his home country and was employed as a professional soccer player and children's soccer coach.\n\nWhen asked about Barrios' sworn declaration, the White House referred to a statement from DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\n“Jerce Reyes Barrios was not only in the United States illegally, but he has tattoos that are consistent with those indicating TdA gang membership,\" she said in a statement. \"His own social media indicates he is a member of the vicious TdA gang. That all said, DHS intelligence assessments go beyond a single tattoo and we are confident in our findings.\"\n\nWhen asked if the administration had additional evidence that Barrio was a member of the gang, an administration official told ABC News he had other tattoos that were TdA-affiliated.\n\nSalvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua recently deported by the U.S. government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center prison, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, obtained March 16, 2025.

How is he doing?' You can imagine the thoughts I have,” she said.\n\nJerce Reyes, a soccer player from Venezuela, was deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Courtesy family of Jerce Reyes Barrio\n\nBarrios' family said that they haven't told his young children that he's imprisoned in El Salvador and facing at least a year of forced labor, but they shared a video they filmed of his daughter speaking about her dad.\n\n“I love him so much…he always tells me fairy tales and we always go to soccer games together” she said in the video. “He loved me so much and always made me my breakfast of bread, eggs, and juice. I love you so much, dad.”\n\nTrump announced on Saturday he had signed a proclamation declaring that the Tren de Aragua gang was \"conducting irregular warfare\" against the United States and therefore would deport its members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act and ordered that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador.\n\nAfter officials failed to turn the flights around, Judge Boasberg demanded they provide more information about the flights, under seal, but Justice Department attorneys refused, citing national security concerns. According to a court filing Wednesday morning, DOJ attorneys said they are considering invoking the state secrets privilege to deny the judge that information.",

Kent Nishimura/Reuters\n\nThe judge's order blocks the agency from granting DOGE access to systems containing personally identifiable information and orders DOGE members to destroy any data in their possession that identifies individual taxpayers. However, the judge's decision allows DOGE to continue to allow access anonymized data from the agency.\n\nAccording to Hollander, the decision to give DOGE \"unlimited access to SSA's entire record system\" endangered the sensitive and private information of millions of Americans, risking information including Social Security numbers, credit card information, medical and mental health records, hospitalization records, marriage and birth certificates, and bank information.\n\n\"The government has not even attempted to explain why a more tailored, measured, titrated approach is not suitable to the task,\" she wrote. \"Instead, the government simply repeats its incantation of a need to modernize the system and uncover fraud. Its method of doing so is tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\"\n\nTwo people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit, March 7, 2025. Jim West/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nThe lawsuit challenging DOGE's access was filed last month by two national unions and an advocacy group who argued DOGE's access violated privacy laws and the Administrative Procedures Act. In a statement to ABC News, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees celebrated the decision as a \"major win for working people and retirees across the country.\"\n\n\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement.\n\nIn her decision, the judge also pointed out the irony that DOGE has accessed the sensitive information of millions of Americans while the identities of the DOGE employees working in the SSA have been concealed for privacy reasons.\n\n\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent,\" she wrote.",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\"From an intelligence and law enforcement perspective, the potential for foreign intelligence forces to recruit government workers is hot,\" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAt the same time, state and local governments could step up to fill in their offices with that talent as President Donald Trump seeks to shift many roles and responsibilities out of the federal government.\n\n\"It would be an easy transition for them and, in the end, benefit the public, which needs their experience now,\" Victor Narro, a professor of labor studies at the Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News.\n\nWorkers ripe for the picking by private sector\n\nNarro, who has worked in Los Angeles city public boards and commissions and on a U.S. Agency for International Development project, said one of the biggest things being overlooked in DOGE's mass firings is the fact that many of these employees had strong training from top colleges and chose to have a career in public office instead of the private sector.\n\n\"A lot of public sector employees give up jobs in the private sector because they care about being a public worker,\" he said. \"They all know they could have made a lot more money and had more benefits.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nWhat federal workers may lack in salary, they can make up in connections with policymakers and organizations, as well as access to government data and knowledge. It is common for federal workers who leave the public sector to take that knowledge to private sector jobs, such as consulting firms that specialize in the environment, national security and healthcare, Cohen said.\n\nThe unprecedented mass firing of federal workers may lead to the creation of new private sector organizations made up of those workers, Cohen said.\n\n\"It would be hard to think that those employees wouldn't be in demand,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, billionaire Mark Cuban pitched an idea in a post on March 1 that those fired workers band together and start their own consulting company.\n\n\"It's just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably created. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I'm happy to invest and/or help,\" the Shark Tank host wrote.\n\nThere have been no public updates about Cuban's proposal since the post as of March 18.\n\nForeign national threat increased\n\nCohen said Cuban's proposal has some merit, but he warned that not everyone offering a helping hand will have altruistic intentions.\n\nIn fact, he warned offers could very well be ruses designed by foreign adversaries.\n\nCohen said counterintelligence operations throughout history have targeted disgruntled federal employees who are left in despair and with no way to pay off their expenses and debts.\n\nEach fired worker, from those at the Social Security Administration, who have knowledge about the U.S. benefits system, to nuclear engineers, could be a perfect asset to intelligence agencies in Russia, China and other nations, Cohen said.\n\nAdditionally, general knowledge about the inner workings of federal offices, personalities of top officials and other information could be appealing to adversaries, he said.\n\n\"It's not just classified information that is valuable,\" he said.\n\nFederal workers terminated by the Department of Government Efficiency organize prior to visiting Senators offices to tell their stories in the Senate Hart Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 25, 2025. Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nCohen said Trump and Musk's belittling of the federal workers as lazy, inefficient and not useful for the government will help make it easier for foreign recruiters to make their case.\n\n\"It's a standard recruitment tool. You find that sense of grievance, you fan the flames and you get them to cooperate because they are angry at what was done to them,\" he said.\n\nThose same operations have also found success through more shady tactics, Cohen said.\n\nHe noted that there have been cases where federal employees have unknowingly worked for foreign governments posing as private U.S. companies or have been closely working with legitimate companies already operating in the U.S., clouding evidence of foreign intervention.\n\n\"It could be something as simple as offering someone to write a research paper and pay a lot for it or give a speech at a conference,\" Cohen said. \"From there, it could lead to something long term.\"\n\nGlobal health workers with USAID weep as they attend a protest in support of their fired colleagues who gathered their things inside, Feb. 28, 2025, at the USAID headquarters in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told reporters at news conferences this week that this is playing out in her state, saying on Wednesday, \"What has happened is you have other governments, from China, from the Middle East, from around the world, coming into this country, coming into campuses in Massachusetts and basically saying, 'Hey the federal government is going to take away your funding and take away your research come to our country. We'll give you a lab. We'll set you up. We'll give you a staff. And you can pioneer the new technologies on our shores.'\"\n\n\"That's not putting America first,\" she added.\n\nTypically, the federal government prompts workers to do their due diligence and refrain from working with anyone appearing to have foreign government ties, but Cohen said it is going to be difficult to self-police this on such a massive scale.\n\n\"The government has to rely on someone's patriotism and their sense of ethics to willingly not support a foreign intelligence service. But very often, a person may not know they are being recruited,\" he said.\n\nState, local governments to the rescue?\n\nThe recruitment efforts, however, aren't limited to foreign entities and private companies. State and local governments are now seeking to fill their offices with the displaced talent.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the \"You're Hired\" campaign, which encourages fired federal workers to go to New York and apply for jobs in various state agencies. The state placed ads in Union Station that redirected them to a website with state job offerings.\n\n\"We're looking for qualified, experienced candidates across a wide variety of fields. I need technologists, I need engineers, I need attorneys, healthcare workers, educators, public policy experts and so many more,\" Hochul told reporters at a news conference on March 3.\n\nAn ad in Union Station in Washington D.C. has been trying to recruit fired federal workers Office of New York Governor, Kathy Hochul\n\n\"I'm in competition for the top attorneys, the top engineers [and] people to work at the Department of Financial Services,\" she added. \"In a place like New York City, there's a lot of higher-paying jobs. So these are special people who walk away from those jobs and those opportunities and come here, and I want to let them know that we will take care of them.\"\n\nAs of March 18, over 200 people have signed up for webinars hosted by the New York State Department of Labor, according to the governor's office.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, have started similar campaigns.\n\nNarro said it is not surprising that local governments would take the opportunity to fill their offices, given that many are now bracing for extra responsibilities following the DOGE cuts.\n\nAt the same time, there is no guarantee that those local governments can take in all of those workers, he said.\n\n\"A lot of it depends on the state. You have a better chance of getting a public job in New York versus Iowa because of the number of offices, departments and ultimately the budget,\" Narro said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the media on the South Lawn of the White House, Mar. 11, 2025, in Washington. Samuel Corum/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nCohen and Narro added that Trump's pledge to give more power to the states, particularly education, but no details on how they would get the funding to do so has also left many states in limbo when it comes to recruitment.\n\n\"It's great that the states are coming up with these programs, but if they can't commit, you're going to have more frustrated federal workers,\" Cohen said.\n\nCan the damage be undone?\n\nNarro noted that the situation with fired federal workers is still fluid as court cases play out and some of the firings have been stopped or reversed.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty alone could be devastating to the future of the federal workforce.\n\nDemonstrators rally in support of federal workers outside of the Department of Health and Human Services, Feb. 14, 2025, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\n\"People's families depend on stability, and if they can not keep up with the changing decisions, they may just quit altogether,\" Narro said. \"I suspect this is what Trump and Musk are seeking to do in their strategy.\"\n\nNarro said that even if Trump's and Musk's policies are reversed by a future administration, there could be long-term damage.\n\n\"In the end of the day, the public loses out the most,\" he said. \"It's going to be harder for anyone to consider giving up a private job and dedicating their talents to serving the public if this is how they will be treated.\"",

Duffy said at the time that the \"scope of this pilot project as approved exceeds the authority authorized by Congress\" under the Federal Highway Administration's Value Pricing Pilot Program while calling it \"backwards and unfair.\"\n\nThe MTA has said it is challenging the Trump administration's reversal in federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the DOT's move is not proper.

Sarah Yenesel/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nLieber said the federal government has not yet responded to the MTA's initial complaint, and that there is still more time for them to do so.\n\n\"The good news is that the program, which has had such amazing benefits for New Yorkers -- faster travel, cleaner air, fewer crashes, less honking, quieter, better environment for all, and also great economic benefits -- all that is going to continue,\" Lieber said.\n\n\"The program is underway now for 10 weeks, and it's been successful by every standard,\" he continued. \"And it's the right thing to do for New York to continue it.\"\n\nThe congestion pricing plan, which launched on Jan. 5, charges passenger vehicles $9 to access Manhattan below 60th Street during peak hours as part of an effort to ease congestion and raise funds for the city's public transit system. During peak hours, small trucks and charter buses are charged $14.40 and large trucks and tour buses pay $21.60.\n\nThe toll generated nearly $50 million in revenue in its first month and is on track to generate $500 million in net revenue by the end of this year, as initially projected, the MTA said.",

Here's what to know\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nIn President Donald Trump's escalating battle with the judiciary, he and his Republican allies have zeroed in on a similar message.\n\nNo single judge, they argue, should be able to use an injunction to block the powers of the country's elected chief executive.\n\n\"That's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\" Trump said on Fox News earlier this week as he railed against a judge who issued a limited injunction to stop deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to other countries after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, peppered with questions after the administration did not turn the planes around, on Wednesday preemptively offered her own rebuke of judges who've recently ordered injunctions taking effect nationwide.\n\n\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she said. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nThe White House argues that's especially the case when it comes to immigration matters, foreign affairs, national security and the president exercising his constitutional powers as commander in chief.\n\nJudges have, so far, temporarily blocked Trump's efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, freeze federal funding and bring an end to birthright citizenship.\n\nSupporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn general, legal experts told ABC News an injunction is meant to preserve the status quo while judges consider the merits of the case. (Judges also issue temporary restraining orders -- with similar impact -- as short-term emergency measures to prevent irreparable harm until a hearing can be held.)\n\n\"Often the nationwide injunction, or universal injunction, is put in place right at the start of a litigation,\" said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\n\"All of these can be appealed, and they are,\" Frost said. \"It's appealed to a three-judge court and then the Supreme Court after that. So, when people say one district court is controlling the law for the nation, well maybe for a few weeks. The system allows for appeals, and the Trump administration has appealed.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said the same in a rare statement after Trump attacked the federal judge in the deportation flight case as a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and called for him to be impeached.\n\nIn fact, Trump was handed a win when an appeals court last week lifted an injunction on his executive orders seeking to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government.\n\nNationwide injunctions are also not new, though scholars agree they've been used far more in recent decades.\n\n\"We saw them with Obama, we saw them with the first Trump administration, and saw them with Biden,\" Frost said. \"And now we're seeing them even more with President Trump but they go in lockstep with the sweeping executive orders that seek to change and upend vast swaths of our legal structure.\"\n\nAccording to a study by the Harvard Law Review, President Barack Obama faced 12 injunctions, the Trump administration faced 64 and President Joe Biden 14 injunctions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is shown Mar. 17, 2025, in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have either urged the judiciary to rein in injunctions or celebrated their outcomes, depending on whether they align with their political goals.\n\nIn 2023, when a federal judge issued an injunction limiting contact between the Biden administration and social media sites, then-candidate Trump called it a \"historic ruling\" and the judge \"brilliant.\" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually sided with the Biden administration on the issue.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to curb injunctions after three different federal judges temporarily blocked the president's birthright citizenship order, saying it likely violated the 14th Amendment.\n\n\"At a minimum, the Court should stay the injunctions to the extent they prohibit agencies from developing and issuing public guidance regarding the implementation of the Order. Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in an application to the high court last week.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said he understands the \"frustration\" that can stem from nationwide injunctions but ultimately \"judges are there to make sure that the government doesn't violate the Constitution.\"\n\n\"Trump is really taking a sledgehammer to everything government related,\" he said. \"These norms have been around for decades, so you have to allow some time for the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to weigh in and say whether this is appropriate or not.\"\n\nThe White House has said Trump will comply with the courts, but his intensifying rebukes of judges and rulings have raised the question: What happens if he doesn't?\n\n\"That would completely undermine the integrity of our system,\" Rahmani said.",

They attribute the gains, in part, to the fact that “Americans are ready to stand up and fight back against the Trump administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular agenda.” In February 2016, following the first full month of Trump’s previous term, the party recorded pulling in less than $5 million in grassroots fundraising.\n\nThe haul also comes amid Ken Martin’s first month as party chair. The DNC cites the Minnesota Democrat’s leadership as another reason they saw a boost in grassroots support. Top-performing fundraising emails, texts and peer-to-peer messages were signed by Martin in the month since his election on Feb. 1, the memo says.\n\nBut the fundraising increase comes as the Democratic Party grapples with low approval ratings and intraparty fighting around their overall direction and response to the Trump administration’s policies.\n\nA few recent polls indicate that the general public does not see any one person as leading the Democratic Party. One, from CNN/SSRS published on Sunday, found no consensus among American adults over which Democratic leader “best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party,” while also showing that the Democratic Party’s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low.\n\nJust last week, a contentious battle brewed on Capitol Hill over whether to pass a GOP-approved government funding bill, hurled the party into discussions over their strategy and about potential changes in their leadership ranks.\n\nThe DNC, however, has recently made plays to carve out its own lane among the larger party as a leading voice in response to Trump and Republicans.\n\nIn the wake of the National Republican Congressional Committee’s recent calls for GOP House members to pull back on hosting in-person town hall events while constituents have become heated about DOGE’s cuts to the federal workforce, the DNC started pairing with other organizations and state parties across the country to host “People’s Town Halls” in competitive districts with vulnerable GOP House incumbents.\n\nAnother bright spot for Democrats in February, according to DNC fundraising data set to be publicly filed with the Federal Elections Commission later Thursday, is that this month marked the DNC’s best fundraising month via digital ads in an off-year, with more than $1 million raised.\n\n“We expect significant return on investment by the 2026 midterms,” the DNC said in the memo.\n\nThe DNC is prioritizing “balancing high-performing fundraising formats” with “new content that educates donors and invites them to volunteer or give the DNC feedback to better understand their priorities in our fight against Donald Trump,” according to the memo.",

An attorney for Suri told ABC News he is currently being held in Louisiana.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security alleges Suri was spreading Hamas propaganda and accused him of having ties to the terror group.\n\n\"This was done pursuant to a policy to retaliate against and punish noncitizens like Mr. Suri solely for their family ties to those who may have either expressed criticism of U.S. foreign policy as it relates to Israel,\" attorneys representing Suri said in the complaint. Suri's wife is a U.S. citizen, his attorneys said.\n\nOn Monday, according to the complaint, law enforcement agents who identified themselves as members of DHS, told Suri that the government had revoked his visa and did not permit Suri's wife to hand over his passport and other documents.\n\nBadar Khan Suri Georgetown University\n\n\"The agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes,\" attorneys said in the complaint.\n\nTwo hours after he was removed, Suri called his wife to let her know he was being transferred to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said.\n\n\"The Rubio Determination and the government's subsequent actions... and plans to whisk him 1,600 miles away in the same manner as the government did in the case of Mr. Mahmoud Khalil, isolating him from his wife, children, community and legal team, are plainly intended as retaliation and punishment for Mr. Suri's protected speech,\" the complaint says, referring to the recent arrest of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nAttorneys for Suri are requesting the court in Alexandria, Virginia, to assume jurisdiction and vacate the Trump administration's \"unlawful policy of targeting noncitizens for removal based on First Amendment-protected speech advocating for Palestinian rights/and or their family relationships.\"\n\nDHS said Suri was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\" according to a statement. The department alleges Suri had close connections to a \"known or suspected terrorist\" who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\n\nOne of the attorneys who represents Suri said his detainment happened because \"President Trump wants to silence anyone he suspects to hold a political opinion contrary to his.\"\n\n\"ICE kidnappings are not new,\" Nermeen Arastu told ABC News. \"This is part of a larger pattern of racially motivated attacks on immigrant communities under the Trump administration. Across the country, people from all political backgrounds are being targeted by U.S. immigration authorities simply because of their opinions or beliefs.\"\n\nThe attorney said Suri's legal team was able to connect with him and he is currently held in Louisiana.\n\nGeorgetown University said Suri is an Indian national who was granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the university said in a statement. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",

        "content": "A jury has convicted a failed political candidate of federal charges in connection with a series of drive-by shootings\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A jury has convicted a failed political candidate of numerous federal charges in connection with a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of state and local lawmakers in Albuquerque in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nFormer Republican candidate Solomon Peña had pleaded not guilty to 13 charges including conspiracy, weapons-related charges and interference with federally protected activities in connection with the shootings in December 2022 and January 2023 on the homes of four Democratic officials, including the current state House speaker.\n\nThe attacks took place as threats and acts of intimidation against election workers and public officials surged across the country after President Donald Trump and his allies called into question the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nProsecutors allege that Peña resorted to violence in the belief that a “rigged” election had robbed him of victory in his bid to serve in the state Legislature.\n\nThe shootings targeted the homes of officials including two county commissioners after their certification of the 2022 election, in which Peña lost by nearly 50 percentage points. No one was injured, but in one case bullets passed through the bedroom of a state senator’s 10-year-old daughter.\n\nDefense attorneys say Peña was not involved in the shootings and that prosecutors were relying on the testimony of two men who bear responsibility and accepted plea agreements in exchange for leniency.\n\nPeña faces a possible sentence of life in prison. His legal team plans to appeal.\n\n“The verdict this evening is a travesty,” attorney Nicholas Hart said in a statement. “The evidence showed that Mr. Peña had nothing to do with these shootings. Solomon Pena was prosecuted because of his political beliefs, and because he advocated that the 2020 election was stolen and rigged.”\n\nJurors listened to more than a week of testimony from elected officials who were targeted, investigators and Peña’s co-conspirators. Demetrio Trujillo and son Jose Trujillo previously pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with the shootings.\n\nPeña was arrested in January 2023 and held since then in state and then federal custody. The weapons charges included allegations that Peña fired a machine gun in relation to a crime of violence.\n\nA sentencing hearing has not been scheduled.",

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nAdministration lawyers took a similar position when judges ordered funding cuts from USAID and other agencies restored or for spending to be unfrozen, according to court documents.\n\n'Dangerously close'\n\nRichard Pildes, the Sudler family professor of constitutional law at NYU Law School, who has been involved in many federal court cases, told ABC News that such defiance of the courts undermines the judicial branch and could have serious consequences.\n\n\"I would say, we are dangerously close to a constitutional crisis. Maybe we're dancing kind of on the edge of a constitutional crisis,\" he told ABC News.\n\nJames Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, who has been involved in federal cases, agreed that the country is on the \"precipice\" of such a crisis, noting that the courts are limited in being able to enforce their rulings.\n\nHowever, he noted, courts are designed to be deliberative with cases.\n\n\"The courts are essentially saying, we need to slow down,\" Sample told ABC News. \"The executive [branch] may ultimately get what it wants. … But if the executive gets what it wants without a process, then not only the individuals lose, but all of us lose justice.\"\n\nWhat constitutes a constitutional crisis?\n\nSample said constitutional scholars have differed on what exactly defines a constitutional crisis.\n\n\"The one thing we can say for certain is that it's not an on-off switch,\" Sample said of constitutional crisis. \"It's not a binary. It's a position on a spectrum.\"\n\nRetired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN this week.\n\n\"No one really knows. People have different views on that,\" he said.\n\nSample said the Trump administration's actions are sliding closer to the concerning part of the spectrum -- a development, he said, that could never have been foreseen by the nation's founders.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is shown Mar. 17, 2025 in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\"What we are experiencing is not a blitzkrieg against [political] adversaries, but rather a blitzkrieg on the part of the executive against the rule of law itself. That is a defining characteristic of a crisis for the rule of law,\" Sample said.\n\nPast crises were isolated\n\nAside from the Confederate states' succession leading to the Civil War, the experts ABC News spoke with said that past examples of constitutional crises ended up blowing over, such as when President Franklin D. Roosevelt threatened to go forward with a military tribunal against a Nazi sympathizer from Long Island during World War II.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ultimately gave the president the power to go forward, according to Pildes.\n\nIn some cases, the executive branch has stepped in to enforce court orders, such as when then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the National Guard to make sure states followed the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education landmark decision ending segregation in public schools.\n\nArkansas National Guard troops escort nine students from Little Rock's Central High School at the end of the day's session, Oct. 3, 1957. Bettmann Archive\n\n\"All of those [past examples] are sort of an individual, discrete issue, not a kind of more pervasive or systemic disregard of the courts and rulings of law by the executive branch,\" Pildes said.\n\nThe Trump administration's actions put courts in uncharted waters\n\nThe Trump administration's actions, in contrast, the experts said, are unprecedented because of the speed both at which the administration is enacting Trump's policies and opponents are challenging the administration's moves in court.\n\n\"The executive has some capacity to change facts on the ground before the courts can act and it can be hard to undo some of those actions, even if the courts end up concluding that they were unlawful,\" Pildes said.\n\nSample, of Hofstra, compared it to a computer being so overloaded it can't process the information.\n\n\"The volume of what is happening, and the speed at which it is being undertaken, is crashing the constitutional hard drive,\" he said.\n\nThe situation has been played out over the last couple of weeks as Trump has claimed that he would abide by court orders that issued temporary restraining orders over his policies, such as deportations, mass firings of federal workers and discharging transgender service members; however, court documents have indicated that those orders were not followed in many cases.\n\nTrump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, have also gone after Judge James Boasberg on social media after he issued from the bench a temporary restraining order against the administration in a case challenging the president's executive orders to deport Venezuelan migrants.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, Feb. 26, 2025.

Their bar licenses could be at stake,\" he said.\n\n\"Then, if there are misrepresentations that lawyers make in court, that can also be sanctioned against the lawyers,\" Pildes added. \"Sometimes that very sanction is enough to get them to comply. But if it's not, the courts can start imposing fines.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is seen in Washington, Mar. 5, 2025. Tierney L Cross/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"As the executive defiance kind of goes on, more and more officials would have to be involved in going down this path with the executive of not complying,\" he said.\n\nSample, however, noted that if a court chose contempt, it could further test the Constitution because the U.S. Marshals Service, which is under the jurisdiction of the executive branch, would be involved with enforcing an order.\n\n\"It's not far-fetched to believe that the Trump administration would, in the face of a contempt order, just simply tell the U.S. Marshals Service not to enforce it,\" he said. \"This goes back to that same principle that the glue that holds the constitutional structure together is not just law, it's norms.\"\n\nThere already has been some pushback from the top level of the judiciary to Trump's rhetoric.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts rebuked calls to impeach judges with a rare statement this week.\n\n\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" he said.\n\nTrump dismissed Roberts' statement in an interview with Fox News, claiming Roberts did not directly mention him by name. Trump and his allies have continued to verbally attack federal judges who have issued temporary restraining orders and injunctions on implementation of his policies and executive orders.\n\nThe public's role is crucial in averting crises\n\nSample and Pildes said that given their actions so far during the last couple of weeks, it is unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress will step up to curb Trump's rhetoric and action and force him to comply with the courts..However, public opinion will play a big part in preventing the country from entering a crisis, they argued.\n\n\"The tool, the arrow in the quiver of the courts is the legitimacy and the public's faith in the legitimacy of the process playing itself out of those rulings. One of the things that is a hallmark of a civilized society is that if the citizens believe that a process was fair,\" Sample said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick delivers remarks at a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26, 2025 in Washington. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPildes noted that as the Watergate scandal unfolded and then-President Richard Nixon was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to release audio tapes that implicated him on impeachable offenses, public opinion had already turned on him and his allies in Congress to the point that he resigned.\n\nPildes added that public opinion can be expressed through economics, which federal leaders watch attentively. Business and stock markets are typically weakened if governments and the rule of law are disrupted and that could force the executive to rethink their resistance to the courts, he said.\n\n\"If we get to [a constitutional crisis], you can imagine easily a lot of turmoil that would actually show up in the market show up in the economy. People will stop wanting to invest here,\" he said.\n\nSample said the country's current polarization will make it harder for a public consensus, but he believed that generally, Americans would be speaking out against anything that leads to a crisis.\n\nDemonstrators rally on the National Mall during the NowDC protest, in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025.

The declarations also allege that many of the migrants do not have ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua or have any criminal records.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged in a sworn declaration earlier this week that \"many\" of the noncitizens deported under the Alien Enemies Act did not have criminal records in the United States.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News about how authorities are determining if migrants are gang members, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that the Trump administration is \"not going to reveal operational details about a counterterrorism operation.\"\n\nMichelle Sarabia Gonzalez, the sister of Anyelo Jose Sarbia, who is believed to be in El Salvador, said in a sworn declaration that when she and her brother went to a routine ICE check-in two months ago as part of the asylum application process, officials did not allow her brother to leave.\n\n\"The officers asked me whether my brother belonged to a gang and about a tattoo that is visible on his hand,\" Gonzalez said. \"The tattoo on his left hand is of a rose with money as petals.\" Gonzalez said in her declaration that her brother is not affiliated with Tren de Aragua.\n\nIn several declarations, attorneys described how their clients were placed on a plane for deportation but were removed because a Temporary Restraining Order was issued before the plane departed.\n\nAttorney Stephanie Quintero said her client was told by an ICE agent, \"You all do not know how lucky you are. You all hit the lottery because you are not getting deported today.\"\n\nA tattoo of a rose is seen on the hand of a Venezuelan migrant. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n\nQuintero said her client and several other detainees were removed from the plane and sent back to El Valle Detention Center.\n\nAttorney also described how authorities brought them by bus to the plane after taking them out of detention centers in Texas over the weekend.\n\n\"They were chained from top to bottom -- wrists, waist, ankles, chains which came up through their backs so they could barely move,\" said Quintero.\n\nOne of the detainees, Quintero said, almost passed out on the bus \"from heat exhaustion and dehydration and started bleeding profusely from his nose.\"\n\n\"The detainees notified the guards, but they did not provide that person with medical attention,\" Quintero said. The incident was also mentioned in a declaration from another immigration attorney.\n\nAustin Thierry, an attorney who represents a Venezuelan migrant named E.V. who is believed to be in El Salvador, said his client did not have removal orders and has a hearing scheduled before an immigration judge in June.\n\nThierry said E.V. has an infant son who is a U.S. citizen. According to Thierry, E.V. was detained after ICE officials showed up to his house looking for another individual.\n\n\"Since E.V.'s detention, his partner and infant son have struggled to meet their expenses and maintain housing,\" Thierry said.\n\nThierry said he believes his client's crown tattoo \"may be why ICE falsely accused him of gang membership.\"\n\n\"This crown is not related to Tren de Aragua, but rather a tribute to his grandmother whose date of death appears at the base of the crown,\" Thierry said.\n\nAttorney Linette Tobin, who represents Jerce Reyes Barrios, a professional soccer player from Venezuela who protested the Maduro regime and was detained and tortured after one of the demonstrations, said his client was falsely accused of having a gang-affiliated tattoo.\n\n\"He chose this tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favorite soccer team Real Madrid,\" said Tobin.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a former DHS official, pushed back on a declaration filed earlier this week by an ICE official who claimed that the alleged gang members were deported because ICE is not prepared to detain members of TdA.\n\n\"ICE detention facilities in the United States are prepared to detain any noncitizen, regardless of their security risk level,\" said Fleischaker in her sworn declaration. \"This includes people with violent criminal histories, as well as members of gangs and Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\"\n\nThe former DHS official said ICE detention facilities are able to manage all levels of detainees and said that ICE could have detained the individuals safely \"for the duration of their removal proceedings.\"\n\nAttorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union said in a filing that the migrants who were sent to El Salvador \"face prison conditions that have been deemed harsh and life threatening due to systemic abuse in the prison.\"\n\nThe ACLU attorneys added that the Alien Enemies Act does not provide a process for individuals to contest that they are members of the TdA or provide individuals with a \"statutory grace period\" to seek judicial review.\n\nAfter Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, lawyers said, \"people with upcoming immigration proceedings started being moved overnight from ICE detention facilities around the country and not allowed to appear at their proceedings, where many were seeking asylum,\" the lawyers said.",

Regional head Ivan Fedorov published photos showing fire fighters extinguishing flames at multiple damaged residential buildings.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 214 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks. It said 114 of them were intercepted and another 81 were jammed.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones, 34 of them over the Volgograd region and others over Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions. The authorities didn’t report any casualties or significant damage.\n\nMeanwhile, a massive blaze at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region has continued to rage since it was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack late Wednesday.\n\nUkraine and Russia agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries’ leaders this week, though it remained to be seen what possible targets would be off limits to attack.\n\nAfter a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that “technical” talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected from attack under the agreement.\n\nThe three sides appeared to hold starkly different views about what the deal covered. While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.\" Zelenskyy said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized Friday that the agreement reached between Trump and Putin referred only to energy facilities, adding that the Russian military is fulfilling Putin's order to halt such attacks for 30 days.\n\n“The Russian military are currently refraining from strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached between Russia and the United States,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.",

        "content": "Hear new interviews from authorities who worked on taking down Matt Baker.\n\nWaco's beloved minister, after nearly 20 years, still claims he isn't guilty of murdering his wife\n\nBaptist minister Matt Baker was once a beloved pastor just outside Waco, Texas. Unbeknownst to his congregation, he was leading a double life that led him to commit the ultimate sin.\n\nBaker is now serving a 65-year sentence after being found guilty in January 2010 of murdering his wife Kari Baker, in 2006.\n\nAn all-new \"20/20\" episode, \"Dirty Little Secret, \"which airs Friday, Mar. 21, at 9 p.m. on ABC and starts streaming the next day on Hulu, features John Quinones' exclusive new interviews with Texas Ranger Matt Cawthon and detective Abdon Rodriguez.\n\nYou can also get more behind-the-scenes of each week's episode by listening to \"20/20: The After Show\" weekly series right on your 20/20 podcast feed on Mondays, hosted by \"20/20\" co-anchor Deborah Roberts.\n\nFifteen years after his conviction, Baker still maintains his innocence, saying that his wife died of an apparent suicide.\n\nTexas Ranger Matt Cawthon speaks with ABC News Correspondent John Quiñones about the Kari Baker murder case. ABC News\n\n\"Kari Baker didn't kill herself. She was murdered. He was a predator,\" Texas Ranger Matt Cawthon -- who was involved in the case -- said in a new interview with \"20/20.\"\n\nIn a 2010 interview with \"20/20,\" Baker admitted to having an affair with Vanessa Bulls, a divorcée who testified at his murder trial that Baker was openly plotting his wife's death.\n\n\"I'm coming clean on the lying about Vanessa,\" Baker told \"20/20.\" \"I made a mistake. I'm human. I made a mistake there. I should not have ever got involved in that. I was having a tough spot in my marriage and I took the chicken way out. But I would never have hurt my wife. I never did. I never laid a hand on her, ever.\"\n\nOn Apr. 7, 2006, 31-year-old Kari was found dead seemingly due to an overdose of sleeping pills. There was a typed, unsigned suicide note, but her family suspected foul play.\n\n\"She wouldn't have done this, she would not have left her girls,\" Nancy Lanham, Kari's aunt, told \"20/20.\" The couple had two young daughters at the time.\n\n\"20/20\" interviewed Matt Baker from prison in 2010. ABC News\n\nBaker told ABC News in 2008 that his wife's alleged downward spiral began with the tragic loss of another daughter years earlier. She was only one year old when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died four months later, leaving Kari devastated.\n\n\"She had been taking sleeping pills to go to sleep since Kassidy passed away,\" Baker said. \"And started taking more and more of them. And we had discussions that 'you've got to stop doing this, this is too many, this can be dangerous.'\"\n\nThe police investigation initially concluded that Kari's death was a suicide. However, her family began investigating on their own and urged police to further question her husband.\n\nBaker passed a polygraph test arranged by his attorney. Frustrated that the police had ruled Kari's death a suicide, her mother Linda Dulin sought out an investigative team of her own.\n\nKari Baker’s family, including her mother Linda Dulin, are seen in an ABC News “20/20” interview. The family gathered to start their own investigation into Baker’s death. ABC News\n\nDulin reached out to Bill Johnston, a former federal prosecutor who was part of the team that prosecuted the 11 surviving Branch Davidians in 1993. Dulin explained to Johnston that she didn't believe her daughter took her own life.\n\nShe said she had been working on Kari's case with what she called her \"Angels\" -- her sisters and niece who were determined to find out the truth about what happened to Kari.\n\n\"What Charlie's Angels were bringing to us was invaluable,\" Johnston said. \"They were this group of strong women who were not going to just let this go. They brought a series of stories about Matt's conduct at different points in his life.\"\n\nKari's family believed that Baker's affair with Vanessa Bulls was the motive behind what they believed was Kari's murder.\n\nIn September 2006, Cawthon -- in collaboration with police -- was able to get Kari's body exhumed, and an autopsy was conducted. There was still no clear cause of death, but the generic form of Ambien was discovered in her muscle tissue. The team working with Dulin discovered that Baker searched for the drug online.\n\nThe findings made it crucial to keep investigating.\n\n\"During this investigation, we got a clue from a woman who worked in a jewelry store,\" Cawthon said. \"And said within a couple of weeks after Kari's death, Matt Baker comes into the jewelry store with a woman, and they're looking at engagement rings.\"\n\nBaker denied this in his interview with \"20/20,\" saying they had gone to the store to look at earrings for one of his daughters.\n\nHowever, during the trial, Bulls testified that Baker stated that his daughters wanted to look at wedding rings for her.\n\nKari Baker, a beloved Texas mom, was murdered in April 2006. ABC News\n\nAlthough she had been previously interviewed, she had never admitted to having an affair with Baker or that she knew anything about Kari's death. Prosecutors then decided to subpoena her to testify in front a grand jury and give her testimonial immunity, hoping she would cooperate.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone in the room, she admitted on the stand that Baker had told her he had killed Kari. It was enough for prosecutors to indict Baker for his wife's murder that same day.\n\nAt trial, Bulls said she felt controlled by Baker: \"He was a complete and still is a manipulative liar who took me at my vulnerable state.\" Bulls also testified that she felt intimidated by Baker to keep quiet: \"Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret\"\n\nThe prosecutors' theory was that Baker had drugged Kari and then suffocated her. The testimony from Bulls corroborated that theory.\n\n\"She did explain that after he thought that he had killed her, that she'd been suffocated, that when he removed the pillow, she gave one huge gasp,\" prosecutor Susan Shafer said. \"She was still alive, and that he immediately put the pillow back on her face and held it until he was sure that she was dead.\"\n\nIn January 2010, Baker went on trial for his wife's murder. After several days of testimony, it took the jury only seven hours to decide Baker's fate: guilty. It was a verdict that seemed to stun him. The next day, Baker was sentenced to 65 years in prison.\n\n\"I believe the jury made a mistake in this,\" Baker said in court after he was sentenced.\n\nWhile Kari's family finds some relief in knowing Baker is incarcerated, they say that the guilty verdict didn't alleviate the sadness and pain he has caused them.\n\n\"She was an amazing mother and cousin,\" Lindsey Pick, Kari's cousin, told 20/20. \"And she would fight for any of us. And, I just wanted everyone to know the truth.\"",

Like the efforts to save the Inari Sámi language, practices like this help keep Indigenous knowledge alive.\n\nIn 1996, linguist Marja-Liisa Olthuis had a difficult decision to make. Should she speak to her newborn daughter in Finnish or Inari Sámi, the endangered language of her Indigenous community?\n\nWith only a few hundred speakers left, Inari Sámi was rarely heard outside a handful of families. Finnish, spoken by millions, would have been the easier choice—especially since Olthuis had moved away from Lapland. But she knew that if her daughter didn’t learn Inari Sámi at home, she might never learn it at all.\n\n“I decided that I would speak to Sofia, my daughter, in Inari Sámi,” Olthuis said. “And that’s how it all started.”\n\nThis choice helped spark a decades-long movement to revive a language at the edge of extinction.\n\nThe importance of language\n\nFor the Sámi, language is more than communication—it’s central to identity. Inari is part of Sápmi, the historic Sámi homeland spanning northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Among its Indigenous communities, the Inari Sámi (Aanaar Sámi) have lived in what is now Finland the longest.\n\n“As many as nine Sámi languages are spoken across Scandinavia, Finland, and Russia,” says Taija Aikio, a spokesperson for Inari’s Siida Museum. “Three of these languages are spoken in Finland—Northern Sámi, Skolt Sámi, and Inari Sámi. All are endangered, and in the 1990s, Inari Sámi was almost gone.”\n\nTuula Airamo carries on the herding traditions of her Sámi ancestors at her reindeer farm by Muttus Lake in Inari, Finland. As the Inari Sámi language experiences a revival, cultural practices like reindeer husbandry remain a vital link to the past. Photograph by Nano Calvo, VWPics/Redux\n\nThe decline began in the 17th century when Swedish colonial rule imposed taxation and Christianization on the Sámi. By the 1920s, newly independent Finland introduced compulsory education policies discouraging Sámi languages.\n\n“Children were sent to boarding schools and often not allowed to speak Sámi even amongst themselves,” says Aikio. “They could get punished, even beaten sometimes.”\n\nWorld War II delivered another devastating blow. During the Lapland War of 1944, Nazi forces, retreating from Finland, razed nearly every building in the region. Most of Lapland’s civilian population, including the Sámi, were evacuated to central Finland or Sweden.\n\n“When the Sámi people came back from evacuation, they realized that a lot of their history was lost. We needed a place to store what we had left and recover items that had traveled beyond Sápmi’s borders to bring them back home and preserve them for future generations,” says Aikio. The Siida Museum was founded in 1963 for this purpose.\n\nHowever, while artifacts, traditional clothing, and archaeological findings can be preserved under glass, language requires speakers to survive.\n\nOnce the dominant group in the region, Inari Sámi speakers saw their numbers decline as migration and Finnish influence grew. After the war, many families returned, adopting Finnish as their primary language and passing it on to their children. By the 1990s, the number of speakers had dropped to just 350, most of them over 70 years old.\n\nWhat you lose when a language disappears\n\n“In 1986, there were only four children left speaking Inari Sámi,” says Olthuis. “We have to thank Matti Morottaja and Ilmari Mattus for teaching the language to their children and starting the Anarâškielâ servi, the Inari Sámi Association.” The organization became the foundation of the language revival movement.\n\nIn 1997, the association launched Finland’s first Sámi language nest in Inari, inspired by a Māori model from New Zealand. These full-immersion kindergartens surrounded children with the language from an early age.\n\nBut a single language nest wasn’t enough. “With so few people speaking Inari Sámi, who was going to teach the children and speak to them outside the nest?,” says Olthuis.\n\nThe first language nest created about 40 new speakers in its first decade, but with just two teachers, expansion was difficult. The association realized that saving Inari Sámi required adult learners—not just children.\n\nReclaiming a lost generation of speakers\n\nIn 2007, Olthuis became the first person to defend a doctoral thesis in Inari Sámi. Instead of stopping there, she developed a language education program at the Research Institute for Languages of Finland to rebuild the lost generation of adult speakers. Her Complementary Aanaar Saami Language Education (CASLE) program took an innovative approach. Rather than focusing on the few remaining native speakers, it trained non-native professionals willing to use the language daily and teach it after completing the program.\n\nThe program brought tangible results: CASLE graduates allowed two more language nests to open—one in Inari and one in Ivalo—helping create a stable new base of young speakers.\n\n“We’ve seen a reversal of sorts. Until not long ago we didn’t have speakers; now we even have foreigners coming to us to learn. I like working with these language learners. I value every person who learns the language and works with it,” says Olthuis.\n\nToday, Olthuis estimates that about 500 people can speak Inari Sámi, and the number continues to grow. In 2013, she published the book Revitalising Indigenous Languages: How to Recreate a Lost Generation to share the details of the revitalization project with other Indigenous communities worldwide.\n\nThe future of Inari Sámi\n\nWhen Fabrizio Brecciaroli first moved to Finland from Italy, he knew little about the Sámi languages. “I had never even been to Inari when I started studying Inari Sámi. I’d never met a Sámi person in my life.”\n\nLittle did he know that 20 years later, he would become one of the leading figures in the Inari Sámi revitalization movement.\n\nHe originally planned to spend a semester in Tampere, then return home to finish his engineering studies. But after meeting his husband, he stayed in Finland, became fluent in Finnish, and transitioned into freelance translation.\n\nA decade later, he discovered a five-year online course in Inari Sámi offered by the University of Oulu. “I became the first Italian to learn Inari Sámi and one of the few foreigners to get a master’s degree in the language,” says Brecciaroli.\n\nBy 2019, Brecciaroli was working with Marja-Liisa Olthuis, taking over publishing activities for Anarâškielâ servi, which had shifted its focus from language nests to books, newspapers, and digital tools. He is now the editor of Anarâš Aavis, the only daily newspaper in Inari Sámi, launched in 2023. The publication releases at least five issues per week, alongside a print magazine for association members. Additionally, they translate a variety of books for both children and adults.\n\nTechnology is also playing a growing role. “We are now developing a digital spell-checker and a grammar checker in collaboration with the Arctic University in Norway,” says Olthuis. “It’s a slow process, but it works. This job is not for pessimists. You just keep going.”\n\nBrecciaroli also leads efforts to expand Wikipedia content in Inari Sámi, which launched in 2020. “We now have 6,050 articles published in Inari Sámi,” he says.\n\nSome help is coming from the outside as well. The University of Tartu in Estonia created the first digital translation software to translate 23 Uralic languages, including Inari Sámi (and Estonian).\n\n“A lot of culture depends on language. It’s an important piece of identity. But we don’t worry about losing Inari Sámi anymore,” says Olthuis. “We now have voices on the radio and in the media. We won’t lose this language. My friends and I work for it.”",

It was one of the most extraordinary sightings of a leopard I’ve ever had.”\n\nIn 25 years of wildlife storytelling, National Geographic Explorer Sandesh Kadur has seen and documented more rare wildlife than most people experience in a lifetime.\n\n“Then, the leopard goes to the tree next to us and puts its paws up. It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.\n\nHe was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett . Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.\n\n“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”\n\nAs an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats. He shares them with the world through his visual storytelling, which offers his audiences first-time glimpses into rarely-seen phenomena in the natural world, and urges viewers to protect its vulnerable inhabitants.",

        "content": "The river flows vast and soundless. It’s December in southern Kazakhstan, and the landscape near the Syr Darya River is smudged in shades of brown and taupe—dormant grasses, silted floodplains, leafless trees. This is not the most picturesque stretch of riverbank, strewn as it is with food wrappers, bottles, a decomposing sedan. Overhead, the sun is obscured by a haze of coal- and woodsmoke. But when it comes to what Bernie Kuhajda is searching for, the spot feels perfect.\n\n“This is the habitat we need,” says Kuhajda, an aquatic conservation biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. He’s hoping to find a species of sturgeon—the Syr Darya—that’s native to these waters but hasn’t been seen since the 1960s, after a series of Soviet dams was built throughout the river system. Those projects blocked access to the fish’s spawning grounds and forever changed the flow of the Syr Darya, which drains from the high peaks of Kyrgyzstan into what is now the remnants of the Aral Sea. If the sturgeon somehow still exists, Kuhajda thinks this silty, shallow expanse of river is where it can be found.\n\n(Critically endangered sturgeons threatened by proposed dams in Caucasus.)\n\nSome months earlier, Kuhajda had been contacted by the conservation organization Re:Wild, which administers a program to search for what it calls lost species—creatures that haven’t been seen for at least a decade and could be extinct, but there’s not enough data to be conclusive. The officials at Re:Wild reached out to Kuhajda knowing that he was one of a very small collection of scientists who have ever laid eyes on the Syr Darya sturgeon. As a graduate student in the 1990s, he visited museums in London, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and videotaped 27 spindled specimens, bleached white from years of storage. “They said, ‘You’re the expert,’ ” Kuhajda says, remembering the call with Re:Wild. “And I said, ‘Well, I’ve seen them dead in a jar.’ ”",

        "title": "8 of Europe's best beginner hikes",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nTempted by the idea of hiking holidays but worry they’ll be too gruelling? Here are eight beginner-friendly hikes that are less about endurance and more about the simple pleasures of the Great Outdoors. Some will take you just a few hours, others last several days. But regardless of which you choose to tackle, each has been chosen for their combination of easy terrain, well-maintained paths and spectacular surroundings. Just be sure you’re properly shod before you start. A pair of well-fitted walking boots, appropriate for your hike and chosen with the help of an experienced shop assistant, will save you a world of pain once you get going.\n\n(Essential day-hiking gear, from trail clothing to clever backpacks.)\n\n1. Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Italy\n\nLength: 5.5 miles\n\nTime: 3-4 hours\n\nIn the mountains, hikers have a simple rule of thumb: the best views come on the biggest walks. Unless, that is, you’re walking the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit in the Italian Dolomites. It girdles three of the most gobsmacking walls of shattered rock you’ll ever clap eyes on — and yet the path is broad and steady throughout, with each ascent carefully paced. It begins and ends at a series of car parks by the Rifugio Auronzo (access is controlled and there’s a fee to pay as well) — and from there you can walk either way. It’s also served by bus from Auronzo. Hike it in June or September to avoid the high-summer crowds and bring a pair of telescopic hiking poles if you’re tackling it in June, in case there’s still snow on the path. You don’t want to slip as you stare, slack-jawed, at the extraordinary scenery.\n\nWhen the right weather conditions prevail, the route to Riomaggiore can be a scenic trip with heavenly views.

Sentiero Azzurro, Italy\n\nLength: 8 miles\n\nTime: 2-3 days\n\nMost hikers could complete the whole coast-hugging length of the Sentiero Azzurro — from Monterosso to Riomaggiore — in one short but intense day of walking. But why would you want to chew through such a magnificent route in a few hours? Linking the five villages of Liguria’s famous Cinque Terre, this narrow path is a route to savour, getting the walking done early in the day to avoid any crowds, then taking your time over lunch, boat trips and sea swims during the rest of the day. July and August are best avoided on account of both the heat and the overtourism. But that’s no bother, because the weather is already balmy in April and can stay warm till October. On a sunny day, the sense of height and space is so intense, you’ll think you’re peering over the edge of a cloud. Bring walking poles if you’re at all unsteady on your feet, check beforehand if your chosen sections of path are open (landslides can close them) and don’t forget to buy a path permit. You can catch a train from any the five villages when you’re done.\n\n3. The Chemin de Puy, France\n\nLength: 40 miles\n\nTime: 4 days\n\nDon’t worry, we’re not suggesting you hike the full 457 miles of this pilgrim’s trail, which links the French town of Puy-en-Velay with the Camino de Santiago in Spain. We’ve cherry-picked a short section through rural Gascony, starting in Éauze, where the land is rich and green, the gentle hills easily tackled and the food and wine always tempting. You do, however, need to walk it the wrong way — against the flow of hikers — so that your final goal is the loveliest town on the route. For three miles before you reach it, hilltop Lectoure beckons you along leafy lanes and between rolling wheat fields. Once there, expect to be greeted by an ensemble of cafes, boulangeries and medieval walls. The other stops — Montréal-du-Gers, Condom, La Romieu — are all ancient and lovely, too, and, because the route is covered by France’s GR65 long-distance footpath, it’s served by excellent online mapping. Agen is the key railway station — linked by bus or taxi to both Éauze and Lectoure.\n\nWalking along Hadrian's Wall is a treat for history buffs, passing ancient ruins and archeological sites. Photograph by Roy James Shakespeare, Getty Images\n\n4. Hadrian’s Wall, England\n\nLength: 21 miles\n\nTime: 4-5 days\n\nFor hikers with a penchant for history, the central section of Hadrian’s Wall, from Birdoswald to Chollerford is a long and continuous treat, packed with evocative ruins, mind-expanding archaeology and an ever-present sense of communion with the people who garrisoned the frontier. It is also, by upland standards, easy-going. The long-distance trail that follows the wall is well-maintained and is shadowed by a lower, flatter route when the ridge line dips and rolls too steeply. Peppered with B & Bs, the path offers plenty of places to break the journey while the 681 and AD122 bus services connect you to railway stations on the Carlisle to Newcastle line. Just remember to keep each day’s walking short. That way you’ll have time to explore key sites and museums, as well as diverting south to the fort at Vindolanda — Britain’s richest trove of Roman remains, it’s still producing extraordinary evidence after nearly 60 years of excavations.\n\n5. Stockholm Archipelago Trail, Sweden\n\nLength: 6 miles\n\nTime: 2 days\n\nAll told, this extraordinary island-hopping trail covers 168 miles across 21 islands in the Stockholm Archipelago. But thanks to excellent ferry services it’s easy to pick out a section or two from the list and add an outdoorsy extension to a Stockholm city break. The island of Grinda is the obvious choice. About 90 minutes from the city's quay at Strömkajen, it’s far enough out to deter most day-trippers, but also home to the Wärdshuset, a pretty guesthouse and restaurant for anyone who needs a longer escape. So, if you book far enough in advance, you'll enjoy understated, Scandi-style comfort after your walk. Come in June or July, avoid the weekends and bring your bathers. The footpath around the island serves up forested bluffs, smooth, half-submerged boulders and sheltered little bays perfect for swimming. Boats putter, seabirds swoop and you’ll wish you could stay a whole week.\n\n6. Heidschnuckenweg, Germany\n\nLength: 30 miles\n\nTime: 3 days\n\nVoted Germany’s most beautiful hike in 2014, this ‘Trail of the Heath Sheep’ is also one of its easiest. For 136 miles it explores the long, north-south strip of the Lüneburg and Southern Heaths — with no hill higher than 555ft and the path broad and sandy for most of its length. Hike it in mid to late August when the heather blooms and turns the landscape into a sea of lilac, but don’t feel obliged to go the full distance. The three-day stretch provided by stages 3 to 5, from Handeloh to Bispingen, offers a lovely taster — with rail access at either end and some serene villages en route for overnight stops. None, however, are quite as soothing as car-free Wilsede. You’ll probably stop for lunch here on day two and, for a brief and blissful moment, it’ll seem like you’ve hiked out of the 21st century altogether.\n\n'Heischnuckenweg' is known as one of Germany's most scenic hikes. Photograph by Markus Gebauer, Getty Images\n\n7. Lechweg, Austria\n\nLength: 77 miles\n\nTimes: 8-10 days\n\nHow do you have a multi-day hiking holiday in the Alps that doesn’t strain every sinew? Simple: you follow a river downstream. And not just any river. This 77-mile trail follows the Lech — one of the wildest watercourses in central Europe, which floods with snowmelt every spring and has carved out a landscape of gravel banks and floodplains that look more Canadian than Austrian. On your hike, two magnificent walls of mountain will be your companions as you descend the valley, through forests, meadows and over dramatic suspension bridges. A combination of train and bus will get you from Zurich or Innsbruck airports to the mountain town of Lech, while Reutte’s railway station is a good place to catch a train to Munich for the journey home.\n\n8. Hallin Fell, England\n\nLength: one mile\n\nTime: one hour\n\nFor a family-friendly hike, try Hallin Fell. Set halfway along Ullswater in the Lake District National Park, it’s all but a mound compared with Helvellyn’s glowering massif nearby. You can drive a third of the way up it, too, but that just adds to the sense of drama. It begins with the switchback road up to the car park, continues with a short but breathtakingly steep ascent through 500 vertical feet and finishes with a dizzy, 360-degree view of open water, round-topped fells and busy Cumbrian skies. And even with the obligatory snack stops, you’ll all be at the top in half an hour. The smooth grassy path means it can be tackled in wellies or grippy trainers, too. For those without a car, the Ullswater Steamer service from Pooley Bridge to Howtown offers even more exciting access, though it does double the length of the walk.",

        "content": "Why the Congo Basin appears to be more resilient than the Amazon remains an incredibly complex question, and researchers are looking for answers in the trees. Back at Yangambi, Yakusu leads me down a trail through the surrounding forest and then signals that we should head deeper into the underbrush. As we leave the path, the texture of the ground suddenly changes, crackling softly as dried branches snap beneath our feet and then grow squishy as we step over the soft husk of a decomposing tree trunk. We finally stop in front of a huge tree with a wide, smooth trunk that juts high into the canopy. Part of the mahogany family of trees, it belongs to a particular native species called Entandrophragma utile.\n\nThe tree is part of another long-term survey that’s been happening at the station. To inspect it properly, Yakusu unslings his backpack and produces a wood borer shaped a bit like an oversize corkscrew, placing it against the trunk a few feet above the ground. When he turns the handle, the hardwood seems to resist at first, creaking under the pressure being applied. After a few minutes, Yakusu extracts a long, thin core sample of wood from the inner layers, which he carefully inserts into a protective sleeve. “You have to be careful to not let it break,” he says.\n\nInside the station’s modern wood biology lab—another first in the DRC—researchers would be able to compare the tree’s height and trunk diameter with visible rings from the core sample to determine changes in its growth over time in relation to the climate. “As we’ve demonstrated, the rainforest is warming,” Yakusu says. “This means that the environment in which these trees grow is changing and the conditions for growth are no longer optimal.” In the long run, decreased tree growth could lead to higher tree mortality in the region, one factor responsible for the Amazon’s diminishing capacity to store carbon.\n\nAlready some tree species are disappearing. In the research station’s archives, detailed records on a tree from the same genus, Entandrophragma palustre, show that it was once the most studied species at Yangambi. “But in this forest, you won’t find a single palustre today,” says Yakusu. At the same time, some trees are proving more resistant to extreme climate shifts, which could hold the key to helping the forest adapt. Chadrack Kafuti and Brice Djiofack, two tropical ecologists working at Yangambi’s wood lab, have been closely studying the adaptations of Pericopsis elata, a large-leaved hardwood with the surprising capacity to pause its growth during periods of drought or when sunlight is scarce. That kind of resilience could help direct replanting in areas where the forest has been logged for lumber or affected by wildfires, which are increasingly common.\n\n(Our report on when the Congo Basin reopened to large-scale logging.)",

It’s the scent. A thick, mineral-rich fog clings to the air, an unmistakable reminder that the earth here is very much alive.\n\nWelcome to Owakudani, one of the most otherworldly destinations in Japan. Here the ground exhales plumes of sulfur, the rocky terrain is tinged in shades of ochre and gray, and the region’s most famous culinary delicacy — black eggs, or kuro-tamago — are said to add seven years to your life.\n\nThe journey to Owakudani\n\nTo embark on the quest for these enigmatic eggs, one must venture to Owakudani, which translates to \"Great Boiling Valley.\" This geothermal hot spot was forged some 3,000 years ago during Mount Hakone's last eruption.\n\nToday it’s another kind of hot spot for tourists seeking a whiff of the mineral-rich air and a taste of its famed black eggs. The landscape is a spectacle of nature’s raw energy, with fumaroles hissing, sulfur-stained rocks glowing in eerie shades of yellow, and steaming pools bubbling like a witch’s cauldron.\n\nSharp-eyed visitors will also notice the network of pipes running alongside the mountain, funneling Owakudani’s prized hot spring water to nearby ryokans (traditional inns), a testament to the region’s long history as an onsen retreat.\n\nReaching this volcanic wonderland is an adventure in itself. Visitors can take a bus from Hakone-Yumoto or Gora, winding their way up the mountain roads. But the most thrilling approach is by air.\n\nThe Hakone Ropeway carries passengers high above the rugged terrain, offering a dramatic ascent through swirling plumes of steam and sweeping views of Hakone’s mountains. As the gondola nears the summit, the lush greenery below gives way to an unforgettable preview of the raw volcanic forces at work.\n\nFor chef and food writer Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook, her first visit to Owakudani with her family was nothing short of surreal.\n\n\"As the gondola ascended from Sōunzan Station, we were greeted by the lush mountain scenery of Hakone and the breathtaking sight of Mount Fuji,” she says. “But as we crossed the first peak, the scenery changed dramatically—suddenly, we were hovering over a stark, sulfuric volcanic terrain, which caught us completely off guard.\"\n\nIf there were ever a dramatic setting for a snack break, this would be it.\n\nOwakudani's volcanic valley has active sulphur vents and hot springs. Photograph By Olga Kashubin / Alamy\n\nThe culinary alchemy\n\nThe process of creating kuro-tamago is a blend of science and a dash of culinary magic. Fresh eggs are placed in wire baskets and submerged into the bubbling hot springs, rich in sulfur and iron. As the eggs cook, a chemical reaction occurs: The iron in the water reacts with the hydrogen sulfide gas, resulting in iron sulfide, which imparts the eggshells with their distinctive black hue.\n\nAfter about an hour, the eggs are retrieved, moved to a steam pot, and steamed for 15 minutes to finish the process.\n\nDespite its dark exterior, the inside of the black egg is surprisingly tender, smooth and white. The flavor is, well, eggy. And though the aroma is strong, the taste offers only a slight hint of sulfur.\n\n“Most people are shocked by the huge contrast between the appearance and taste,” says Mamoru Sato, director of the Hakone Tourism Association.\n\nThe real flavor is in the experience — the act of peeling away the inky shell to reveal the familiar comfort of a hard-boiled egg, all while standing on an active volcanic vent.\n\n“Our kids were initially hesitant to try them,” Chen says. “Our daughter even pinched her nose to avoid the distinct sulfuric aroma! But after cracking the shells and sprinkling a little salt, we all took a bite — hoping to extend our lives by seven years, as the legend goes.”\n\nOutside the souvenir shop, glossy black egg-shaped stools are scattered across the landscape, offering the perfect perch to snack and soak in the scene. On a clear day, Mount Fuji looms against the backdrop of Owakudani’s steaming, sulfur-streaked terrain. Standing there, time itself seems to hesitate, as if granting you the extra years legend has promised.\n\nThe seven-year legend\n\nThe belief that eating black eggs grants an extra seven years of life has captivated visitors for decades. So where did this tradition begin? The commercial production of boiling black eggs in Owakudani’s hot springs started in 1955 with the Okuhakone Kanko Company, but the roots of the longevity legend stretch much further back.\n\nOwakudani is home to Enmei Jizo, a statue thought to have been carved by the Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi about 1,200 years ago. According to Sato, this Jizo is said to grant longevity and protect children, a belief that evolved into the idea that consuming black eggs could extend one’s lifespan.\n\nAnd why seven years? The number isn’t random; it’s deeply tied to Japan’s cultural beliefs, since the number seven is considered lucky.\n\nSato cautioned that there’s no scientific evidence behind the longevity myth, but that hasn’t stopped the story from enticing tourists and locals alike. “Talking about living seven years longer while eating black eggs is an essential part of the Owakudani experience,” he says.\n\nWhether you take the legend to heart or simply enjoy the eggs for their unique origin, the ritual of peeling back an obsidian shell while gazing over the steaming valley has become as much a part of Hakone’s identity as its hot springs themselves. But before you attempt to immortalize yourself through mass egg consumption, be forewarned: The life-extension benefits are said to max out after two eggs.\n\nA word to the wise\n\nWhile the allure of kuro-tamago is undeniable, it's essential to approach Owakudani with respect. The area is subject to volcanic activity, and access can be restricted due to elevated gas emissions. Visitors are advised to check current conditions before planning their trip and to heed all safety warnings.\n\nAfter all, no egg — no matter how life-extending — is worth a rendezvous with danger. And for those with respiratory issues, the sulfuric fumes might be a bit overwhelming, so be prepared to duck inside if necessary.\n\nHere's where you can taste it\n\nThe black eggs are available at Owakudani Kurotamagokan, which sells eggs that have been freshly prepared that day. To get there, take the Hakone Tozan Cable Car from Gora Station to Sōunzan Station (about a 10-minute ride). At Sounzan Station, take the Hakone Ropeway to Owakudani Station, another 10-minute ride. The shop is located on the second floor of the Owakudani Kurotamagokan building and is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.",

The lady and her entourage were trained to use a dagger for self-defense and, if all was lost, to maintain their honor at all costs.\n\n(FX’s Shogun is streaming now on Hulu.)\n\nMartial arts training for samurai women depended greatly on the individual family.

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "‘It’s the curvy path’\n\nThis whole journey started because Roberts’ took a leap of faith.\n\nAs a media professional, Roberts has worked for CosmoGirl, Essence, Ebony and Heart & Soul magazines. She eventually started her own entrepreneurial publishing nonprofit endeavors, sharing stories of women changemakers around the world. She followed a job to D.C. in 2016, and visited the newly-inaugurated National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n“That’s how I saw the photograph that changed everything.”\n\nHad she not moved to D.C., she says she may not have visited the museum. And had she visited as tourist and not a resident, she may not have meandered the museum’s halls with such leisure, and she may not have taken notice of the details of one portrait in particular.\n\n“I think all of those things were leading me to this moment. It’s all connected, it’s the curvy path,” says Roberts.\n\nThe photo of a crew of Black women in wet suits aboard a boat was her first encounter with DWP. It beckoned her to follow. She phoned the co-founder, Kenneth Steward. She pledged to join them.\n\n“The universe works in strange ways,” says Roberts, reflecting on how she grew up nowhere near an ocean.\n\n“I imagined the divers. And then I imagined myself as one of them. I didn’t know it would lead anywhere, I just knew I wanted to know more.”\n\nSo she quit her job to follow the divers and help tell their stories.\n\nA way of honoring ancestors\n\nThe March, 2022 issue of National Geographic magazine featured Roberts, making her the first Black woman Explorer to grace the cover of the publication. Photograph by Wayne Lawrence\n\nRoberts’ path shows a nuanced story as she ricochets from peaks and valleys toward a calling. It’s the detail and complexity she aims for in the narratives she uncovers in her work.\n\n“Think about the Clotilda shipwreck… that’s a story that no one would know if the Clotilda descendants hadn’t been like ‘oh, we have saved artifacts and the stories of our ancestors, we’re not going to let anyone forget them.’”\n\nThe Clotilda , Roberts reflects, represents a uniquely complete story. The vessel sailed in 1860, illegally transporting captive Africans from present-day Benin to Mobile, Alabama. It is said a wealthy landowner by the name of Timothy Meaher challenged Northern businessmen with a thousand-dollar wager, claiming he could slip African people past federal officials and into Mobile Bay.\n\nThe ship itself is remarkably well-preserved in the muddy freshwater of Alabama’s Mobile River, compared to other wrecks, which are often shattered on the sea floor, coalesced into the marine ecosystem, or dissolved over time. And the Clotilda’s African survivors, who were removed from the ship as the captain burned it to hide evidence, established the community of Africatown in Mobile once they were freed from enslavement after the Civil War. They neighborhood they established eventually grew into a community of tens of thousands, including their descendants. It still exists today and which continues to honor the stories of those ancestors from the nation’s last known slave ship.\n\n“That's often not what you get around stories that involve African Americans,\" Roberts says. \"Most of us cannot trace our histories all the way back to a slave ship or to a particular country in Africa because the records of the enslaved were not recorded in detail. So it’s incredible and very powerful that these descendants know the actual stories of their ancestors that came from Africa.\"\n\nFor the podcast Roberts interviewed not only the descendants of those on slave ships, but close to 100 other historians, archaeologists and community members about their unique relationships to this history. “By the end of it, I realized that these weren’t just stories of death, that these were stories of life, too,” Roberts recalls.\n\n“It’s a complicated history, but that’s the way history is supposed to be.”\n\nThe Christianus Quintus and Federicus Quartus wreck site were the first dive Roberts recalls leaving an impression on her, “I felt more than anything a sense of agency and power,” she says.\n\nIn 1710 two Danish slave ships, the Christianus Quintus and Fredericus Quartus went down in the Atlantic. Some 40,000 Danish bricks signaled the wreckage to experts in the 1970s, despite their considerable decomposition. A cannon and large anchor are still laid out as artifacts on the seabed. After quashing a revolt, the two vessels veered off course, missing their St. Thomas destinations by over a thousand miles, the crews mutinied, freed approximately 650 captive people due to dwindling resources, and scuttled the vessels which now lie in the ocean sands of present-day Costa Rica.\n\nAs the site came into view for Roberts, “I felt, ‘I see you and I’m going to help bring this story back to human memory. We are going to help make sure you are honored, not forgotten.’”",

        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nPoint to any part of America’s vast 50-state map and there’s an adventure to be had. Always experimenting, forever innovating — there’s never a dull moment in the US and this year brings a host of new tours, anniversaries, relaunched trains and overlooked regions to explore. From the surf-lashed West Coast to the vast forests of New York State — and all the canyons, vineyards and honky-tonks in between — travellers are guaranteed to find their perfect slice of Americana in this list of experiences for the year ahead.\n\n1. Ride the revived Gulf Coast train\n\nAmtrak’s Southern Gulf coast train is set to become one of the USA’s great rail routes when it reopens in spring 2025, following a 20-year hiatus thanks to the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina. The train will link the Mardi Gras capital of New Orleans in Louisiana and the waterfront city of Mobile in Alabama. Following the southern US shoreline for most of its three-hour journey, it will pass through Louisiana’s Cajun country — known for its miles of bayous, traditional festivals and hearty gumbos (spicy chicken and seafood soups) — and coastal Mississippi. The latter is a less-visited area with white-sand beaches, fresh crawfish and walkable seaside towns, all easily accessible from stations along the line. The train will run twice a day and will also have a dining car serving Southern food for on-board meals. ES\n\n(After 20 years, Amtrak's Gulf Coast train line is back—here’s what to expect.)\n\n2. Check out art in Pittsburgh’s POP District\n\nSix blocks in the blue-collar city of Pittsburgh are being transformed into an arts district as a homage to one-time resident Andy Warhol — and the final phase is opening this year. Few know that the 20th-century artist was born in Pittsburgh; his life’s work is documented in the seven-storey Andy Warhol Museum, which provided the impetus for the POP District, its name standing for People of Pittsburgh. In 2025, the final phase will see the opening of the Factory Creative Arts Center, with over 32,000sq ft of interdisciplinary arts space, including a theatre for concerts, screenings and events. LH\n\nFollowing the Black Heritage Trail, visitors will pass by Acorn Street in Beacon Hill. Photograph by Susanne Kremer, AWL Images\n\n3. Trace Malcolm X’s legacy in Boston\n\nIt’s 100 years since the civil rights activist was born, and starting this May, Malcolm X’s birthday is to become an annual holiday in Boston. Though born in Nebraska in 1925, he lived in the Massachusetts city on and off for 12 years during a pivotal — if controversial — era in the fight for African American rights in the US. The formative years he spent in Boston have left a lasting legacy that can still be seen in the city’s monuments and thriving Black neighbourhoods. Malcolm X lived in Roxbury during his time in Boston, but to learn about the city’s Black history that paved the way for the civil rights movement, travellers can also follow the 1.6-mile Black Heritage Trail through the historic Beacon Hill neighbourhood, home to the Museum of African-American History. Plans are underway to extend the Black Heritage Trail to Roxbury, too. RF\n\n(Follow the civil rights history tour in Boston.)\n\nNew York City is resurrecting the Roaring Twenties from art deco classics to clandestine bars that pair cocktails with jazz.

Get in the spirit of Gatsby’s New York\n\nA hundred years after F Scott Fitzgerald’s cult-classic novel The Great Gatsby shone a light on extravagant Long Island mansions and secret speakeasies in New York City, the spirit of the Roaring Twenties is returning to the Big Apple. Take a tour of the city’s hopping jazz joints, art deco temples and ritzy hotels that are channelling this glamorous bygone era; at The Plaza hotel, there’s even a Gatsby-themed suite. And on a trip out to Long Island, travellers will find mansions like Oheka Castle, said to have been one of the main sources of inspiration for Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby; many are now open to the public with museums and fountain-sprinkled gardens to stroll through. ZG\n\n(From extravagant mansions to speakeasies, New York is ready to party, old sport.)\n\nThe most spectacular view of White Face Mountain can be caught from Lake Placid in New York state.

Return to the wild in the Adirondacks\n\nA 9,375sq-mile patchwork of state-owned and private land, the Adirondack Park, four hours north of New York City, is bigger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks combined. Yet, with no gates or fees to enter, it retains a sense of wildness that can feel missing in those other parks. Home to Indigenous groups including the Mohawk and Mahican for millennia, the Adirondacks became more widely known with the 1869 publication of William Henry Harrison Murray’s Adventures in the Wilderness. This influential book encouraged camping for recreation rather than survival and inspired thousands of New Yorkers to ‘vacate’ their apartments and flee to the Adirondacks. The region lost its lustre during the 20th century as international travel became more accessible and the area’s Great Camps fell into disrepair, but today the region’s hiking trails and lakes are experiencing a revival thanks to a local commitment to sustainable tourism. KG\n\n(The birthplace of the American vacation is in the midst of a revival—here's why.)\n\nNew Mexico's many wine-tasting rooms offer samples from the nearby vineyards. Photograph by Chris Putnam, Alamy (Top) (Left) and Photograph by Maguey Images, Getty Images (Bottom) (Right)\n\n6. Taste New Mexico’s wine\n\nFramed by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the north and the Chihuahuan Desert in the south, the US’s fifth-largest state is a land of rolling sand dunes, prehistoric petroglyphs, fairytale caves and dormant volcanoes. Equally as diverse as the topography is the culture, which reflects the history of the Indigenous, Hispanic and Anglo-American peoples who have coexisted in New Mexico for centuries. Winemakers here take great pride in their history, reflected in the cellar door experiences at local vineyards, where travellers can sample wines crafted by Native American, female and Hispanic producers. Very few of New Mexico’s wineries export overseas, meaning they’re little known outside the state – which makes tasting New Mexico’s wines an experience worth travelling for. The southern grape-growing regions of the Middle Rio Grande Valley and Mimbres Valley are home to 85% of the state’s wineries, but one of the most interesting winemaking regions is set around the high-altitude town of Taos in the north. AH\n\n(A guide to the unexpected wine country you need to visit: New Mexico)\n\nMia Reona is one of the many female rappers creating a new sound based on Nashville's country music heritage.

Listen to the new sounds of Nashville\n\nIn America’s country music capital, a new generation of trailblazing female rappers is stepping out from the shadows of Nashville’s beloved honky-tonk bars, bringing a different sound to the city’s music venues. While country music made it famous, Nashville has been a nerve centre of America’s music industry since the late 19th century, home to major songwriting publishing houses and recording studios. The National Museum of African American Music, which opened on Nashville’s Broadway in 2021, is an acknowledgement of the city’s rich Black music legacy; local artists like female rappers Sweet Poison and Meme Jenkins are some of this music scene’s pioneers, and travellers can follow in their footsteps on a tour of the city’s alternative side, from a hip-hop-themed pizzeria to vintage fashion stores and music stages hidden above the honky-tonks. ZG\n\n(Meet the female rappers carving out a home in Nashville, America's Music City)\n\nChicao celebrates the 250th anniversary of the modern skyscraper this year.

Explore a fresh take on Chicago\n\nNew pedestrian tours are offering a glimpse into the usually off-limits interiors of some of the city’s most celebrated buildings. Having launched in time for the 140th anniversary of the Home Insurance Building, the world’s first skyscraper, in 2025, the Inside Chicago team takes travellers on a whirlwind walking tour of the Loop. A visit of this downtown district provides access to five famous spaces that give context to the architectural marvels visitors see on the streets of the city. Stops range from the streamlined and futuristic art deco Chicago Board of Trade building to the postmodern architecture of Federal Plaza. KV\n\n(How to get an insider tour of Chicago and its celebrated architecture.)\n\n9. Find Frank Lloyd Wright in the Hudson Valley\n\nConsidered one of America’s greatest architects and a pioneer of 20th-century US modernism, Frank Lloyd Wright’s progressive designs can be seen from Arizona to Pennsylvania. In June last year, a new building opened for private tours on an island in New York State’s Hudson Valley. Although Massaro House on Lake Mahopac was only inspired by Wright’s original drawings, the building features the architect’s signature terraced levels and incorporates the natural surroundings, with a giant boulder doubling as a kitchen and bathroom wall. KV\n\n10. Stay on a sci-fi set\n\nTo feel like you’ve wandered onto a film set, book into Outpost X — an architectural oddity in Utah, around 1.5-hour’s drive from Zion National Park. Opened late last year, it’s a wellness resort designed to mimic a dystopian sci-fi fantasy. Upon arrival, guests embark on an extensive onboarding process that immerses them in the post-apocalyptic planet’s history. Guests can stay in cave houses, Viking tents or geodesic domes, and even rent costumes. The off-grid sci-fi vibe is only enhanced by the desert-like Utah setting; there’s a day-pass option, too. KV\n\n11. Catch a glittering new perspective on Times Square\n\nBuilt as the headquarters of The New York Times, now home to the famous New Year’s Eve glitter ball, the 121-year-old One Times Square building is getting a facelift in 2025. Previously inaccessible to visitors, it will undergo works to become a museum recounting its place in the history of Times Square, complete with a viewing deck overlooking the screen-lit intersection, an augmented-reality entertainment experience and a closer look at the New Year’s Eve Ball. This way, developers aim to bring New Year’s Eve to Times Square every day of the year. It’s hoped the revamped building will be unveiled by summer.

Unravel Miami’s Black roots\n\nFamed for its glossy bar scene, Hispanic-led culture and Floridian beaches, Miami is a city synonymous with sunshine and parties. Yet beneath this veneer lie a number of historic Black neighbourhoods that have helped shape the city’s soul. For a window into Miami’s origins, take a tour of its thriving communities, from Coconut Grove, a laid-back area on Biscayne Bay, to the 1896-founded Overtown – once dubbed the ‘Harlem of the South’. The latter is home to The Historic Lyric Theater, built in 1913, whose stage was graced by the likes of Josephine Baker and Billie Holiday; it’s now owned by the Black Archives History & Research Foundation of South Florida, and hosts history exhibitions focused on the city’s Black heritage. VD\n\n13. Follow Motown to Detroit\n\nOnce nicknamed ‘Motor City’ due to its automotive factories and now in the throes of a cultural renaissance, Michigan’s largest city is also a cornerstone of Black history. Many of the entertainers that passed through the city would have relied on The Negro Motorist Green Book from 1936, advising African American travellers where to safely rest, dine and find entertainment at a time of racial segregation in the US. The city’s Black cultural legacy can be explored at The Motown Museum and at the namesake Charles H Wright Museum of African American History, founded by the pioneering Black Detroit physician. VD\n\n14. Learn about Gullah heritage in South Carolina\n\nThe Gullah Geechee people have lived in South Carolina’s Lowcountry and Sea Islands since the 1600s, and their language, cuisine and traditions continue to define the region today. Descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah people’s legacy is protected in the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, a 12,000sq-mile federal National Heritage Area where traditional sweetgrass basket-weaving and Lowcountry cuisine keep heritage alive. Two-hour Gullah Heritage Trail Tours are led by descendants of the first Gullah settlers, who guide visitors through their family campgrounds and one-room schoolhouses, sharing their community history. VD\n\n15. Take the Civil Rights Trail in Atlanta\n\nGeorgia’s state capital is known as the cradle of the American civil rights movement and a visit to the city is a chance to explore the forces – like political visionary Martin Luther King Jr. – that challenged segregation in the 1950s and 1960s. Visit his birth home before heading to The King Center, where the activist’s gravesite is found and his legacy is honoured. Stop by the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was a member, before exploring the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. Beyond this, don’t miss the Madame CJ Walker Museum, celebrating America’s first female self-made millionaire.

Explore America’s Indigenous heart on a Southwest road trip\n\nA new road trip of the Southwest’s Indigenous heartlands offers travellers a greater understanding of the past, present and future of the country’s original inhabitants, who have called these landscapes home for thousands of years. Along the way, culturally sensitive tours with Native American guides explore ancestral towns and villages – such as Zuni Pueblo, the first place Europeans made contact with Native Americans in the Southwest – and ancient valleys like Canyon de Chelly, which sits inside a Navajo reservation that’s been inhabited for almost 5,000 years. It’s an epic journey encompassing parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, where scorched red earth morphs into cactus-studded desert and back again, passing landmarks like Horseshoe Bend and Monument Valley.

Feast like a Floridian in Tampa\n\nCuban immigrants laid the foundations for Tampa’s original fusion cuisine. Now a new generation of chefs is taking innovation to the next level, fusing Floridian ingredients with influences from as far afield as Germany and Italy. On a tour of the city’s flourishing food scene, travellers should start in the historic neighbourhood of Ybor City, which in the 1880s and 1890s was part of the cigar-making capital of the world. Today, Ybor’s red-brick factories have been reincarnated as shops and restaurants where the legacy of Tampa’s immigrant communities is alive and well, not least in its food scene. The Cuban sandwich is Tampa’s most renowned speciality, but in other areas of the city including Downtown, Tampa Heights and Hyde Park, contemporary restaurants also lean on the city’s multicultural heritage in new ways. EF\n\n(Discover how waves of immigration have created culinary magic in Tampa.)\n\n18. Eat like a king — at a gas station in Louisiana\n\nThis Southern state officially celebrates a Year of Food in 2025. In an homage to the dishes that define Louisiana’s rich and complex food culture, The Louisiana Office of Tourism has conceived eight food trails, which act as roadmaps to the finest regional flavours. The No Man’s Land Gas Station Eats route highlights unexpected Southern hospitality, showing off its Cajun-French specialities. Follow the trail through western Louisiana’s scenic byways to discover Mesoamerican-style tamales in Zwolle and indulgent desserts baked by the Mennonite religious community. The state’s calendar of food festivals showcases everything from shrimp to watermelon via Croatian heritage cuisine. ZG\n\nIn Kansas city, Barbacoa expertly mixes Mexican influences with classic American barbecue. Photograph by Roman Raya\n\n19. Visit the world’s first barbecue museum in Kansas City\n\nKansas City’s first barbecue restaurant began smoking meats over pits in 1908, and there are now more than 100 barbecue joints in this Midwestern city. It’s built a reputation for its slow-cooked, lean-sliced brisket and burnt ends caramelised over fire, all anointed with a sweet and spicy sauce. So, it’s entirely fitting that Kansas City will house the world’s first Museum of BBQ, opening in March 2025. This hands-on venue will take visitors through ten exhibits of the country’s defining barbecue regions. While there, don’t miss Joe’s Kansas City, housed in a revamped gas station and renowned for fall-off-the bone ribs. ZG\n\nThe busy Las Vegas strip is a world-renowned mecca for entertainment and pleasure. Photograph by Alan Copson, AWL Images\n\n20. Hit the jackpot with a tableside show in Las Vegas\n\nAlways synonymous with glamour and spectacle, Sin City is taking its dinner-and-a-show tradition to new heights, with immersive experiences where fine dining and theatre collide at your table. At Papi Steak, 55oz of Wagyu tomahawk emerge from a bejewelled ‘beef case’, ushered in with fog machines and a resident DJ’s thumping beats for the princely sum of $1,000 (£795). Over at Superfrico restaurant, meals are accompanied by performances from the Spiegelworld circus troupe, including pirouetting acrobats in hot-pink wigs and a beatboxing clown. Extra culinary magic is conjured tableside, as chefs transform curds into gleaming mozzarella spheres. ZG\n\n21. Tuck into Santa Fe’s Indigenous food truck scene\n\nIn New Mexico’s capital Santa Fe, a new generation of Indigenous chefs has embraced Native American cuisine delivered in food trucks. The owners of Good as Feast are of Picuris and Cochiti Pueblo heritage and are renowned for their classic Pueblo taco piled high on crispy fry bread. Meanwhile, chef Raymond Naranjo’s Manko food truck pulls up curb-side across the state. His menu of Native American fusion food is inspired by both ancient Pueblo trade routes and his grandmother’s treasured recipes. The Santa Fe School of Cooking offers a more interactive deep dive into Indigenous culinary traditions with three-hour workshops. ZG\n\nAlaska's natural beauty is marked by its diverse landscapes, from the Prince William glacier to lush forests. Photograph by Marisa Marulli\n\n22. Reach the end of the road in Alaska\n\nOften described as the US’s final frontier, travelling in Alaska can feel like jumping through a wormhole. Time here is marked not by the clock, but by the changing of the seasons. Though cruising is a popular way to explore, travelling by land allows more exposure to the wild landscapes of south-central Alaska. From the glaciers of Prince William Sound, where residents offer boat trips through scenic passages, to close hiking encounters with grizzly bears in Lake Clark National Park, and epic, cloud-shrouded mountain exploration in Denali National Park, this remote state offers many incredible experiences. Only 20% of Alaska is accessible by road, yet visitors keep finding ways to explore further. MM\n\n(In pictures: overlanding in Alaska, where glaciers meet bear country)\n\nLake Clark National Park is a rare place where travellers can get relatively close to grizzlies in the wild.

Raise a glass in Fishtown\n\nOriginally settled by fishermen, this ex-industrial neighbourhood is now one of Philadelphia’s best days out. Many come to Fishtown solely for the restaurants — try Suraya for contemporary Lebanese in a garden, Picnic for happy-hour oysters or Bastia for dinner. Traditional pubs, breweries and cocktail dens are all found in the city’s narrow streets, while thrift stores, book shops and specialist outlets are what Fishtown excels at. Try Philadelphia Record Exchange, a mainstay since 1985, for everything from folk, soul and gospel to R & B and rock, and round out the night at Johnny Brenda’s for pool and indie bands.

Photograph by Edmund Lowe\n\n24. Ride into the West\n\nRunning from Washington State to Washington, DC, the 3,700-mile Great American Rail-Trail moves from Pacific waves and old-growth forests at its western end to the White House and the Capitol in the east. This east-west spine is made up of abandoned rail corridors that morph into urban greenways, national parks, forested canyons and prairie lands. Due for completion in 2028, the rail-trail is still a work in progress, however, with its varied terrain, Washington offers an epic taster. Start with natural highs along the Olympic Discovery Trail, before entering Seattle on the 20-mile Burke-Gilman Trail. The Great American Rail-Trail then passes through Snoqualmie Valley before reaching the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.

Party in Palm Springs\n\nThis liberal, Californian desert town has a reputation as one of America’s greatest LGBTQ+ destinations – which has been further cemented by the recent opening of Trixie Motel, a 1950s-style high-camp wonderland launched by drag queen and former RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant, Trixie Mattel. Just two hours from Los Angeles, the city has cultivated a spirit of freedom and acceptance since the 1920s, when it became a hang-out for Hollywood stars. Travellers today come for decadent drag brunches, kitsch pool parties, retro-fabulous interiors stores and bars that riff on old Hollywood legends and gay icons who have loved the city. Palm Springs is also home to the annual ‘lesbian spring break’, Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend – the world’s largest queer women and non-binary festival, which has been welcoming all comers to Palm Springs for more than a century.

        "content": "On winter evenings throughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands of starlings gather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.\n\nHow could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.\n\n(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)",

        "title": "Why ancient pilgrimages are back in vogue in the UK",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nAs the sun begins to set, the choristers file down St John’s Walk, just as they have for the past 500 years. Their cassocks swish softly, their feet tap the worn flagstones and their murmured voices rise towards rafters adorned with angels and griffins. From my room in the medieval cloisters, I follow them along the ancient passage into the cathedral and take a seat in the stalls. The aged wood creaks beneath me, prayer books shuffle quietly in hand and then, evensong begins.\n\nHereford Cathedral has been a site of pilgrimage since 1320, when Thomas Cantilupe, a former Bishop of Hereford, was canonised. Pilgrimages fell out of favour after the Reformation, and for centuries, no travellers have spent the night here or at any other cathedral in Britain. But times have changed, which is how, after a spine-tingling evensong with voices as pure as mountain air, I find myself with the rare privilege of returning to the cathedral after dark.\n\nI’m here to take on the Golden Valley Pilgrim Way, a 60-mile loop winding through the scenic heart of southwest Herefordshire. It’s a land of striking natural drama, where lush, green farmlands merge with the rugged silhouette of Wales’s Black Mountains. It’s also a region rich in history, prehistory and fine food and drink, plus a scattering of churches that, alongside Hereford Cathedral, offer sanctuary to pilgrims after dark.\n\nAnd I’m not alone with this new interest. Walking is experiencing something of a renaissance, having surged in popularity post-Covid when it was one of the few activities we could enjoy. Since then, it has taken the younger generation and TikTok by storm with jovial hashtags like #hotgirlwalks and #softhiking. But the appeal goes far beyond day hikes. Pilgrimages, which traditionally have been spiritual walks to holy places, are making a comeback, but the purpose has changed and they are now undertaken as journeys of personal transformation. Just look at the Camino de Santiago, Europe’s most famous route: in 1984, only 423 pilgrims received completion certificates in Santiago de Compostela, yet, by 2024, that number soared to more than 500,000 people.\n\nIt’s not just historic routes that are drawing people to pilgrimage. The UK is at the forefront of creating new trails, with the Golden Valley Pilgrim Way standing out as a prime example. This inspiring route was brought to life by Simon Lockett, a pioneering rural priest from Abbeydore Deanery, who conceived the idea after undertaking a transformative pilgrimage in Italy.\n\n“The way the path connects with spirituality is very current,” he said when I met him earlier in the day. “Today’s pilgrims may not be religious, but they’re soul-seekers: they’re hungry for the mystical and the contemplative, and they know they can find that in nature. In many ways, we’re going backwards to go forwards,” he explained.\n\nHis words ring true; in an age of increasing complexity, more and more of us seem to drawn to the simplicity of the past.\n\nHereford Cathedral marks the start and end of the Golden Valley Pilgrim Way. Photograph by Paul Thompson Images, Alamy\n\nTo be a pilgrim\n\nThe Golden Valley Pilgrim Way is refreshingly simple. Setting off from Hereford Cathedral, I cross the River Wye and head west towards Wales to begin the four-day self-guided circuit. Almost immediately, life strips back to the essentials: walk, eat, sleep, repeat. I rise with the sun, navigate between ancient landmarks using modern digital maps and restock supplies at local butchers and bakeries. There’s a pleasing rhythm to it all — one that feels both grounding and restorative.\n\nAt first, the sun shines brightly and I walk with the eager spring of a new pilgrim, meandering down country lanes and across muddy fields with bleating sheep. But as the miles pass, the sky begins to darken, and by the time the quaint village of Madley appears, the sun has faded.\n\nMadley is the only stop on this new route with historic pilgrim credentials. In the sixth century, St Dubricius was born here and founded a Christian community that drew many followers. In the first instance, however, the shelter and warmth of the vicarage stables beckons, where I sit down and pull on my waterproofs.\n\n“Do you want to come in?” asks a lady behind a door, ushering me into a room filled with people, tea and biscuits. This is social Saturday and it’s not long before I have a steaming mug in hand and am sitting with the locals. It seems that walking in a circle and sleeping in churches makes for an excellent conversation starter.\n\nAccording to Simon, the Golden Valley Pilgrim Way is as much about these people as it is the pilgrims. “It’s interesting to see how walks like this can help maintain communities,” he’d explained to me before my journey began. “Often, when industries struggle, young people move away, yet this route has already raised morale in the churches and beyond.”\n\nMy own morale has certainly been lifted by this moment of serendipity, the kindness of these strangers and Madley church itself. The structure is grander than one would expect for such a small village, but its atmospheric crypt is the highlight. According to the locals, this crypt was once home to a statue of the Virgin Mary, which was believed to possess special powers.\n\nDespite the rain, I continue contentedly, taking a path through the weathered oaks of Moccas Park, some of which have stood for 800 years, and past Arthur’s Stone, a hilltop tomb that’s watched over the valley for five millennia. With centuries slipping beneath my feet, I finally arrive at St Faith’s church in Dorstone, my home for the second night.\n\nSleeping in a church is like camping in a five-star hotel: immense, spectacular and basic. In Dorstone, that means a wood-clad portaloo in the graveyard, a modest kitchen in the bell tower and a fold-out bed behind the choir. There’s a sense of being briefly part of a place that’s existed since around 1256. I shiver, both at this thought and at the temperature. It seems that old, cold stone and wooden pews are calming but not overly cosy, and I’m certainly grateful for the pile of blankets. I’m more grateful still for Dorstone’s Pandy Inn, where a woodburner blazes beneath the low beams and a hearty pile of chilli beef warms me from within.\n\nThe intricately carved Kilpeck Door is a striking example of Norman craftsmanship.

Photograph by Derrick Golland, Alamy\n\nAfter dinner, I make my way back through the graveyard in the inky darkness, turn the heavy key in the lock and sink into the thick-walled silence for the night. I can feel the walk already settling in — there’s a satisfying physical hum, a mental quietening. Unfortunately, neither of these will dry my boots. So, with damp feet, I set off again the next morning, resuming my rhythm and venturing deeper into the Golden Valley. My wet footsteps carry me past countless bleating sheep and towards the increasingly brooding hills — the sort of untouched countryside that offers Mother Nature’s finest medicine.\n\nI’m carrying a pilgrim passport in my pocket, which I stamp at every church. It’s a mark of progress and encourages travellers to explore every one along this designated route. At St Michael’s church, a vast medieval wall painting depicts Christ surrounded by tools — a warning to Sabbath breakers. Since today is Sunday, I can’t help but wonder if the artist would have approved of my long walk. Meanwhile, in the tiny St Mary’s in Craswall, the hooks in the Norman walls conjure images of children in thick woollen coats; they’re remnants from when the church also served as the village school.\n\nThe treasure-stuffed nave at St Clydawg’s in Clodock has a rare three-decker pulpit, a mysterious ninth-century stone tablet and idyllic views of the Welsh ridges, so close they feel within reach. This is where I’ll be staying for my third evening and I set up my camp bed beside a plaque listing tithes from 1805 (two pence for eggs, sixpence for fruit and vegetables), before preparing a simple dinner in the kitchen and gazing down on my temporary dominion from the minstrel’s gallery. Though my feet remain damp, spirits are high. It’s hard to believe that, after an invigorating day’s walk, travellers are allowed to rest in these rich repositories of history.\n\nIf a church represents the history of a place, writ in wood and stone, then a pub connects you to its present. In Clodock, these two institutions are closely connected: the Cornewall Arms stands right against the church wall. Inside it feels less like I’ve entered a pub and more like I’m in a sitting room: unmatched chairs line the walls, which are adorned with black-and-white photos of fetes and football teams, while a skittles set occupies the centre of the room. There’s no bar, just a hatch. I take a seat by the fireplace and strike up a conversation with Alan Williams, the landlady’s brother, who grew up in the pub. He reminisces about how a proportion of the profits from local farms were once spent here. “It was good times back then,” he says reflectively.\n\nThe rest of the evening’s patrons are a mixed bunch, including sheep farmers, a former TV presenter and, of course, this pilgrim. I feel the warmth of being welcomed, but also a slight wistfulness: pubs like the Cornewall Arms are a dying breed. Talk turns to more outsiders buying holiday homes. “It changes,” says Alan, “but quietly.”\n\nAs I complete the remaining 24 miles of the loop over the next two days, taking in the Golden Valley’s hillsides and holy places, it’s hard to imagine this place unfolding any other way. Quietly. Slowly. Much like the walk itself. When I’d asked Simon about the idea of a circular pilgrimage, he spoke of returning to your starting point with a new perspective. Yet, as I stand by a slab engraved with a scallop shell — the traditional symbol of a pilgrim — at Hereford Cathedral, I don’t experience a grand epiphany. I haven’t found God, or even myself. But I do feel... different. Tired, yes, but clearer and lighter. A small, quiet change.\n\nHow to do it The self-guided Golden Valley Pilgrim Way in southwest Herefordshire is managed by Abbeydore Deanery . Accommodation is available at the nine churches along the route, as well as at the cloisters of Hereford Cathedral. Bookings can be made through the deanery and a donation of £20 per person per night is requested. Digital GPX files of the route are available for download.",

Driven by curiosity and fueled by optimism, he brought back many plants and fruits now taken for granted, such as mangoes from India, peaches from China, and avocados from Chile.\n\nIn 1902 Fairchild first encountered sakura, the flowering cherry trees of Japan. Enchanted by their beauty, Fairchild wanted to bring the trees back home and ordered 125 sakura trees for his own front yard in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n\nThe nursery owner in Yokohama was so pleased to have an American customer that they charged Fairchild just 10 cents per tree. In the spring of 1906 Fairchild’s imported trees bloomed for the first time, and word of the pink blossoms brought so many onlookers to their home that Fairchild ordered 300 more as a gift to the city of Chevy Chase.\n\n1:46\n\nEliza Scidmore, National Geographic’s first official female writer, photographer, and board member, was also an advocate of the cherry blossoms in D.C. After spending time living and reporting from Japan, she returned to Washington with photographs of cherry blossom trees— “the most beautiful thing in the world” —and began petitioning President Grover Cleveland’s administration to plant them along the Tidal Basin.\n\n(Read about the life and times of Eliza Scidmore.)",

In one corner, there was a breathing chamber, where they were sheltered from the rain and the wind.\n\n“Very quickly, they shifted from surfacing in the swimming pool to choosing to breathe inside the chamber,” he recalls. The breathing chamber was surrounded by panels that prevented surface swimming, yet swimming below the surface for about 200 feet would give the seal access to a feeder where it could eat as much fish as it liked, McKnight explains. “Usually a lot of it.”\n\nOnce the seals were familiar with the setup, the researchers started to very gradually change the composition of the air in the breathing chamber, increasing or reducing the levels of oxygen and CO 2 . “We did this very carefully, and just enough to see an effect on their behavior,” McKnight adds. And sure enough: the higher the level of oxygen, the longer the seals stayed at the feeder.\n\nUnlimited Access for Less Subscribe now and save $10 SUBSCRIBE\n\n“This suggests to us that seals don’t just physically respond to oxygen levels by changing their heart rate or respiration, but that they are sufficiently aware of them to change their behavior,” says McKnight. Other, older experiments have sometimes shown that animals try to get away from very low oxygen environments or show signs of stress. “The seals don’t do that,” says McKnight, yet since it affects the length of their dives, they do seem somehow aware of their blood oxygen levels.\n\nFree-diving\n\nThis ability would put seals in a class beyond any land mammals that have been tested. Since oxygen levels on land are pretty constant, humans and other terrestrial animals don’t seem to have evolved to notice low oxygen levels in their blood, sometimes not even when they’re about to pass out.",

For one, they suggest the U.S. urgently needs to pour resources into growing its caregiving workforce to meet future needs. But paradoxically, this number also tells a success story.\n\nToday, thanks to decades of social and medical progress, more Americans than ever are living long enough to get dementia; in the past, more people would have died of cardiovascular disease or cancer at earlier ages. These health advances have also delayed the condition’s onset for many people.\n\nPerhaps the most hopeful news about dementia is that there’s a lot people can do to lower their chances of developing it, says Michael Fang, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead author of the recent study.\n\nThe new study hints at the potential disruption to families, caregivers, and the economy if nothing changes to reduce dementia risk, he says. “But if we do do something, there is an opportunity and a potential to bend the curve a little bit.”",

We went to find out.)\n\nThese cards and card trimmer belonged to Harry Houdini, a lifelong collector of effects, props, and locking devices that he learned how to pick. Alamy/Cordon Press\n\nHis desire for success grew stronger when his father fell sick. In 1883 Ehrich set up an improvised circus along with boys from his neighborhood and performed as a trapeze artist. In a glimpse of his future flair for self-styling, the nine-year-old crowned himself Prince of the Air.\n\nUnlimited Access for Less Subscribe now and save $10 SUBSCRIBE\n\nHaving tried and failed to work as a rabbi, Ehrich’s father moved the Weisses to a New York slum. The young boy’s early love for illusionism and tricks offered the chance of freedom from the fate that awaited so many young immigrants at that time: the lifelong drudgery of the garment trade. As if in preparation for the feats ahead, the stocky Ehrich trained by lifting weights, swimming, and boxing while taking on a variety of manual-labor jobs to make ends meet.\n\nA friend introduced Ehrich to the memoirs of 19th-century French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, considered the father of modern conjuring. In the 1890s, Ehrich added an i to Houdin to make his new last name, and his career, \"like Houdin.\" He also gave himself a new first name in homage to American magician Harry Kellar. Under this stage name, Harry Houdini set up a traveling circus with his younger brother, whose stage name was Theodore “Dash” Hardeen. The brothers featured high-wire acts, snake charmers, and belly dancers.\n\nThe duo reached their long-sought acclaim with what became their signature act, Metamorphosis, first performed at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. Dash tied Houdini up and put him in a sack, which was placed inside a chest. Once the curtain was pulled, Dash was revealed to have replaced Houdini, the speed of which astonished the crowds.\n\nUnrestrained One of Houdini's most iconic stunts was his straitjacket escape. First performed in Kansas City in 1915 in front of thousands, and always staged near newspaper offices, it involved Houdini dangling from a crane by his feet. Wriggling himself free from the straitjacket, shown here, he then\n\nspread his arms wide to the frenzy of the crowd. Bridgeman/ACI\n\nWithin a year, Dash was superseded by young singer and dancer Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner, or Bess, who Houdini had married within three weeks of meeting and made his new partner in magic. They went by the Houdinis, and Bess became his stage assistant for the rest of his life. Although their performances, also consisting of traditional magic tricks, were popular, earnings were scant. Houdini knew he had to maximize the sensationalism to pull in the crowds.\n\nThe handcuff king\n\nExperience as an apprentice locksmith gave Houdini the founding idea of his career. Arriving in a town, he’d alert the press. He would then call a police station and ask to be handcuffed and locked in a cell. Within minutes, he’d walk free.\n\nHarry Houdini moments before being lowered into his water torture cell in 1913. Bridgeman/ACI\n\nThe media coverage from these stunts helped promote the Houdinis’ shows. In 1899 entrepreneur Martin Beck offered Houdini a contract to perform in his theaters. Houdini now had a substantial income, and new horizons suddenly opened. He was performing in Britain in 1900 and Russia in 1903.\n\nHis popularity led to an avalanche of copycats and doubters, forcing him to push his limits and defend his name, even winning a lawsuit in 1902 against a German newspaper that called him a fraud.\n\nStarting in 1908, his signature act was being locked in a milk can full of water. In 1912 he replaced the milk can with the water torture cell, where he was bound in chains and padlocks and submerged upside down. Public fascination with his daredevilry won Houdini star roles in early cinema. The plot of the 1919 movie The Grim Game centers on an escapologist played by Houdini.\n\nPublic fascination with his daredevilry won Houdini star roles in early cinema, like the 1919 movie The Grim Game, shown in this poster. Alamy/ACI\n\nThe shadow of death\n\n“My chief task is to conquer fear,” Houdini said of his acts. He made himself undergo “tortuous self-training” to avoid panic. Biographers have wondered what drove Houdini to such extreme acts. Some suggest it was to resolve the trauma of being a poor outsider. A target of anti-Semitic insults, Houdini seemed to have aligned himself with the emerging idea of the muscular Jew to counter the prevalent stereotype that Jewish men were physically weak.\n\n(Harry Houdini’s unlikely last act? Taking on the occult.)\n\nHoudini was fiercely critical of spiritualism, a hugely popular practice at the time. He regarded it as fraudulent. One reading of his career is as extreme rationalism in the face of death. Yet for a man always prepared to die, the nature of his demise took his admirers, and the country, by surprise.\n\nDuring the height of his career, in October 1926, Houdini was in Montréal to perform at McGill University. A student asked about his abdominal strength and whether he could withstand punches. When Houdini replied he could, the student punched him in the stomach. Houdini seemed to have been unprepared for the blow, which caused him a great deal of pain. Days later, on October 31, 1926, he died in Detroit at age 52. The cause of death was peritonitis, caused by appendicitis.\n\nFrench poster of the 1918 movie The Master Mystery, starring Harry Houdini. Alamy/Cordon Press\n\nDebate continues to rage over whether the punch had indeed been fatal, or if Houdini succumbed to an unrelated intestinal condition caused by his ruptured appendix. In his will, he left his effects and props to Dash, requesting they be burned upon Dash’s death.",

And with the big blowout birthday coming up in 2026, they’re getting ready to show off, including at historic inns where George Washington really did spend the night.\n\nIn some places, festivities have already been planned. But stay tuned, there’s a lot more red, white, and blue to be announced; check America250 and the state links included below for ongoing updates.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia is for history lovers, and they’re starting the celebrations early. The 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry's famous \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" speech in 1775 will be marked this year by filmmaker Ken Burns, a Patrick Henry descendant, in a reenactment ceremony on March 23 in Richmond. “It marks the 250th anniversary — a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the speech in the same church, on the same day, and same time it was delivered, or as close as historians can determine,” says Mike Frontiero, chief communications officer, VA250 Commission.\n\n“Virginia’s Semiquincentennial is not simply about our past,” says Frontiero. “How we commemorate our founding also impacts our present and our future. This is why we have chosen ‘To Form a More Perfect Union’ as our theme. Our founders knew there was more work required 250 years ago, and work remains to be done.”\n\nAnd the Historic Triangle (Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown) is known as the birthplace of America. In summer 2026, the largest living history museum, Colonial Williamsburg, will have a grand display of live reenactments and a Lights of Freedom concert with fireworks.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nThe party’s also starting early in Concord and Lexington. That’s because 2025 marks the beginning of the American Revolution when the \"shot heard ‘round the world\" was fired and the battles began. To commemorate, on April 19, Patriot’s Day, activities will include reenactments at Concord’s Minute Man National Historical Park and Lexington’s Battle Green. The Inn at Hastings Park has several tie-in packages.\n\nAnd Boston, home to iconic sites that flank the Freedom Trail, will be celebrating\n\nbig — and boldly. “This is not your father’s Freedom Trail,” says Nikki Stewart, executive director of Old North Illuminated. “For decades, the 2.5-mile path — a vital landmark attracting four million visitors annually — has predominantly focused on the contributions of ‘elite white men,’” she says. “But with the 250th anniversary approaching, Boston is taking bold steps to reshape the narrative. The story of America’s fight for independence is being reimagined to include the pivotal roles of women, people of color, and other often-overlooked figures, ensuring that their contributions are recognized in the historical fabric of the Revolution.” Expect an unprecedented celebration with an inclusive perspective on the Revolution’s legacy, says Stewart.\n\nThere are also many citywide celebrations planned that will include the iconic Hatch Shell’s Fourth of July concert and fireworks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia will be the liberty belle of the ball. And Philly has also scored a major feat — the FIFA World Cup match on July 4, 2026. Philly is also hosting America’s favorite pastime — the MLB All-Star Game next summer.\n\n“Our most historic inns and all our hotels in Philadelphia are ready to welcome visitors in 2026,” says Jennifer Nagle, vice president, special projects, Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nGettysburg also witnessed pivotal moments in American history, from the bloodiest battle of the Civil War to President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. “We're looking forward to a year-long America 250 celebration in Gettysburg,” says Mary Grace Kauffman, media relations manager, Destination Gettysburg. The 2026 re-enactment in Gettysburg is set for July 3 through 5 at the Daniel Lady Farm. “As for historic taverns, one of the most popular places to dine in Gettysburg, Dobbin House Tavern, is as old as this country and will also be celebrating its 250th in 2026.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City played a significant role in the nation’s birth and Alexander Hamilton was a leading man. Hamilton is the hip-hop Broadway musical about America's founding story and plans are in the works for something special next summer.\n\nThe New York Historical on Central Park West will debut its Democracy Wing in 2026. And in spring 2026, The New York Public Library, a steward of important founding documents, will host a system-wide initiative.\n\nOther New York destinations with pivotal roles in the American Revolution, including Saratoga and Fort Ticonderoga, will also be in a party mood.\n\nBranson, Missouri\n\nBranson has flagged the country’s birthday with a hopeful designation as having the most American flags in one destination. Branson plans to purchase enough American flags for every household in the destination to hang, should they choose to do so, and have the Guinness Book of World Records available to make it an official record, says Heather Hermen, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, Explore Branson.\n\n“We consider ourselves unique with our honoring and celebrating veterans year-round every year, but 2026 will be extra special,” says Hermen. “We have a position on our team, Veterans Initiatives Manager, working with Veterans groups, organizations, and individuals to invite them to Branson to be honored, celebrated, and recognized.”\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe nation’s capital is the icing on the birthday cake. The National Mall will be center stage for celebrations, a year-long event hosted by the National Park Service, Smithsonian, and the National Archives. Expect fireworks, a parade, a two-day celebration on Pennsylvania Avenue, and an entire month-long festival on the National Mall. The National Archives in D.C. is the only place to see the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThere are several historic hotels, including The Hay-Adams, which will be coveted spots to stay.\n\n(Related: America declared independence on July 2—so why is the 4th a holiday?)\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoute 66 is considered America’s Mother Road. The 2,400-mile road was born in 1926, connecting roads from Chicago through New Mexico to Los Angeles.\n\nNext year, visitors can be among the first to celebrate 100 years of cruising America’s Mother Road in the state that boasts the most iconic stretch of the historic highway dotted with neon signs. With more than 450 miles, the Land of Enchantment hosts more of the historic route than any other state.\n\nHistoric Hotels of America\n\n“Many towns and cities that played a role in the Revolutionary-era have fantastic historic hotels and inns,” says Katherin Orr, director, marketing strategy and communications, Historic Hotels of America/Historic Hotels Worldwide. “These are places where history is not a fad or hook, but what hospitality professionals do for guests all the time.”\n\nSome of the oldest: The John Rutledge House Inn in Charleston, South Carolina (1763); Beekman Arms & Delamater Inn in Rhinebeck, New York (1766, George Washington really did sleep here); and Boston’s Omni Parker House (1855).\n\n“Now is the time to start planning where you want to go and what you want to experience during the 250th anniversary celebrations,” says Orr.\n\nTwo if by sea\n\nSail250 will be celebrated with a fleet of tall ships and military vessels in ports around the country next summer. New York will celebrate at the Port of New York and New Jersey on July 4. New Orleans Sail250 will take place at the Port of New Orleans and Norfolk will serve as the host city in Virginia.\n\nGo With Nat Geo: Learn more about where to go in Learn more about where to go in America the Beautiful: A Story in Photographs",

        "content": "The cause of last year’s deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, has been revealed. The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\n\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\n\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\n\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\n\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "A group of Canadian firefighters are feeling the heat after their ill-fated Halloween bash. During the North Sydney Firefighters Club’s Halloween dance, a group of four people dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan joined in on the festivities.\n\nIn video obtained by CBC News, four people are seen entering the Nova Scotia party wearing white robes and pointed hoods. One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\n\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\n\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\n\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\n\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\n\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\n\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion. We spend all of our time trying to do right by the community and are here to do all we can for anyone.”\n\nGouthro added that being “referred to as racists hurts bad.”\n\nWhy KKK-Dressed Attendees Were Admitted to the Party\n\nWhile Gouthro was not working the party in question, he noted that he’s worked the annual event many times in the past.\n\n“When we have Halloween dances you never know what you are going to see come through the door,” he wrote. “Most times we think, ‘Ah it is a costume’ without really thinking of the big picture or the past it represents.”\n\n“So when you folks comment that they shouldn’t have gotten in and that we need to do better, you are right, and we will,” Gouthro continued. “… I will assure you that we are all hurting in our hearts today that we have disappointed a community that we work so hard to make better and protect.”\n\nHe concluded his post by “once again apologizing on behalf of myself and our membership and also a sincere promise to do better in the future.”",

        "title": "For Every Three Great Steps Forward, ‘Atomfall’ Takes One Ugly Step Backward (Review)",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "Going into Atomfall completely blind may have been the best way to experience the game. I’ve seen countless folks refer to this as “British Fallout,” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. If an arbitrary comparison to another game needs to be made here, Atomfall would be compared to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., due to its approach to non-linear storytelling and the need to scavenge to survive.\n\nScreenshot: Shaun CIchacki\n\nThe WOrld of ‘Atomfall’ Is Gorgeous, Confusing, And Full of Intrigue\n\nTypically, Rebellion games always look nice. Games in the Sniper Elite franchise, for example, tend to look good while also running great. Atomfall, on the other hand, is just plain gorgeous. The fantastic lighting, good texture work, and expansive level of design made me stop to look around in awe quite often. While character models are your typical AA fare, the environments here are simply breathtaking. It didn’t matter if I was exploring the outside world, or found myself in a bunker or salt mine, everything looked stellar.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nLighting is also used extremely well here. As I explored through bunkers and other confined areas, I found myself aimlessly wandering in the blackness. Unless I had a torch on hand that I could use to cut a light through the inky dark. Needing to prioritize my line of vision over the ability to use weapons was terrifying, but stealth was on my side more often than not. That is, if the AI didn’t decide to bug out on me randomly. Sometimes, AI wouldn’t spot me if I was a few feet in front of them. Other times, they would turn into an eagle-eyed sniper and take me out from halfway across the map.\n\nThere are some genuinely cool moments here; the first time I held up a gun, loaded or not, at an NPC outlaw with no weapon. They backed off. Instead of instigating the fight, they ran away. I felt like such a badass for doing that, only to get spotted by someone who was half the map away. Even though I may have met my end here, it was still a moment that helped Atomfall feel like a step in the right direction. Frustrating? Yes, absolutely. But thankfully, the game does load very quickly.\n\nScreenshot: Shaun Cichacki\n\nIf ‘Atomfall’ Were A Song, It Would Be “Land of Confusion”. Take That How You Will.\n\nThe worldbuilding of Atomfall is extremely non-linear, allowing me to tackle missions in any order. If I found a piece of paper while exploring, there’s a high chance it’ll be a “Lead” — another mission to add to my list. At any time, I could have anywhere from 1 to 5 missions I’d randomly discover. Atomfall tells me which ones I should prioritize, however, with a massive “Main Story” note off to the side. That way, those who want to focus on the important things can do just that.\n\nBut I wouldn’t suggest slacking on the side quests. Sure, many of them are the same; find a specific spot on the map, explore it, and find the loot at the end. But that loot can be a massive improvement over the nasty gear out in the wild. And pay attention to when the phone rings. You’ll understand when you finally step foot in the world for the first time. Atomfall is also a pretty heavily combat/stealth-oriented game. Make sure you’re always swapping out your gear for better items. Most guns I encountered are rusty, with a tendency to jam at the worst possible time. But this makes firefights feel like a genuine battle of life and death, unlike many other FPS games.\n\nThankfully, I’ve got a fair number of hours in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, so this came as a second nature. Hiding out in the tall grass makes it nearly impossible for enemies to see me, so I can pop shots off and retreat. The main character of Atomfall is fragile, and a well-placed shot can bring me down quickly. Firefights are easily the most exhilarating part of the game, especially once you factor in larger enemies. It’s just a shame the melee combat is quite janky in comparison.\n\nScreenshot: Shaun Cichacki\n\nFirefights Are a Thrill, but Melee Combat Feels Like a Chore in ‘Atomfall’\n\nRunning out of bullets in the middle of a firefight is a common occurrence. A properly placed headshot is enough to bring down most Outlaws, Druids, or any other common enemy I come across. But some were much smarter than I thought, donning a form of head armor that made my one power much more ineffective. That’s where the melee combat would come into play. But Atomfall doesn’t have a great grasp on the concept of melee combat, making up-close encounters much more clumsy and cumbersome than they should be.\n\nEven in the shoes of an everyman hero, the basic human instinct of being able to block an attack should be in my repertoire. But not here. There is no block button, leaving me defenseless as I’m swarmed by multiple enemies. I can kick them back, but as my heart rate continues to climb, these become much more inaccurate and less powerful. There’s also no way to just dodge out of the way of these attacks either, with the motion of the main character going into 0.5 speed when I press backward. It makes many of these combat experiences much more frustrating than they need to be, especially if blasting my way through is not an option.\n\nWhen the melee combat works? It works well enough. But when it starts to slow down, due to either my heart rate going through the roof after a few swipes with a weapon, or just getting surrounded? I know it’s time to prepare to load another save.\n\nScreenshot: Shaun Cichacki\n\nSlow and Steady Wins the Race Here, so Take Your Time and Don’t Rush Through To Get the Best Experience\n\nAtomfall is one of those games that bites off a little more than it can properly chew. For every few steps forward with greatness, a glaring flaw pokes its head out, eager for the sniper to take their shot. But even with the jank, even with the frustrations, I had a good time with Atomfall. It’s one of those games that’s either going to click with you, or it won’t. It’s frustrating in both the best and worst ways. But see it through, and you’ll find one of the most interesting and intriguing games released so far this year.\n\nI’ve got a laundry list of things that I’d love to see Rebellion fix once Atomfall is properly released, with melee combat being the biggest offender here. But if you’re willing to deal with some frustrations, you’ll see that Atomfall is an ambitious game, unlike many other FPS games available on the market. The world feels great to explore, and the firefights are some of the most exciting I’ve ever had in a video game. I just wish that some of the other parts were up to snuff compared to the graphical presentation.\n\nIf you jump into Atomfall, take it slow. There’s no reason to rush toward the ending here. Absorb the atmosphere, lose yourself in the ebb and flow of the game. Examine everything you possibly can, and just enjoy the ride. But as a word of advice, prepare yourself for frustrations along the way. If you think you’ve got what it takes, you’ll find a unique and intriguing world before you. But it’s not a world for everyone to enjoy.\n\nVerdict: Recommended\n\nAtomfall will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on March 27, 2025. A code was provided by the publisher for the sake of review. Reviewed on base PlayStation 5.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "For ten years, the latest interviewee on Informer—our series amplifying the voices of insiders and whistleblowers—consulted as a health and safety officer for the petroleum giant Shell, dealing with the psychological fallout of its voracious global expansion.\n\nTheir job was to listen to thousands of oil and gas workers airing their concerns about the professional hazards and mental and physical toll of working on the frontlines for a company like Shell. Some days, the job meant hearing from contracted workers in the Global South complaining that they hadn’t been paid. Other times, it would be counseling those driven into a state of extreme mental disrepair by allegedly working 31 days straight to keep the pipeline running.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“There’d be times I would close my eyes to go to bed at night and I would just picture burning bodies bobbing around in a water that was on fire,” our Informer says at one point during the interview. “That was basically the nightmare they were talking about that could come true.”\n\nThink your job is stressful? In our Informer’s first week at Shell, the company had to deal with a spill that created an oil slick the size of Belgium just off the Nigerian coast.\n\nHeavy shit indeed. You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\n\nPlay video\n\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\n\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\n\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\n\nI can’t really disclose that.\n\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\n\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\n\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\n\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\n\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\n\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\n\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\n\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\n\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\n\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\n\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\n\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\n\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\n\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\n\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\n\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\n\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\n\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\n\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\n\nPredator hunter as in like…?\n\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\n\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\n\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\n\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\n\nI felt that going in.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are.

        "content": "Green Day might be a trio of wacky-haired rock stars in their 50s, but the Gen X punk band still has some solid trolling in the tank.\n\nThis week, Green Day was in attendance at the iHeartRadio Awards 2025, which was held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The band was nominated for Alternative Artist Of The Year, ultimately topping their fellow nominees: Cage The Elephant, Linkin Park, Sum 41, and Twenty One Pilots.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nUpon taking the stage to accept their award, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong stepped up to the mic and began reciting Mark Wahlberg’s acceptance speech from the 1997 film Boogie Nights, when his character Dirk Diggler won an adult film award. Check it out below:\n\n“Wow. I don’t know what to say,” Armstrong said, clutching the award, as his bandmates ré Cool (drums) and Mike Dirnt (bass) giggled behind him. “I guess the only thing I can say is, I’ll keep rocking and rolling to keep making music and better songs.”\n\n“You know it seems we make these records and sometimes they’re considered filthy by some people. But I don’t think that’s true,” he continued. “This music we make can make people feel better. They can help, they really can, and I really believe that. So we can always do better, so I’m going to keep trying if you guys keep trying. Let’s keep rocking and rolling.”\n\nGreen Is Making A Movie…?\n\nThe choice to quote Boogie Nights might have been more calculated than presumed, as Green Day subsequently announced that they are “making a movie” and are looking for extras to attend a free concert that be featured in said movie.\n\n“We’re making a movie… but more on that later,” the band wrote in an Instagram post. “Right now, we need some extras. Live in LA? Over 18? Free on March 25th?” Come hang with us at The Palladium and be part of a New Year’s Eve concert scene for New Years Rev (said movie)!”\n\nGreen Day went on to explain: “We’ll be playing a few songs—a LOT of times (and maybe a few others). Movies take time, so plan to stay for 10-11 hours. But don’t worry, we’ve got sandwiches and drinks covered.”\n\nFinally, the band wrote: “Sound good? Hit the link in our bio to sign up and get all the details. See you there!” It seems that the free tickets for the show are already gone, so the rest of us will just have to wait until the movie comes out to see it.",

        "content": "Normal iPad too big for ya? Try out the iPad Mini. Its 8.3″-screen reduces the overall dimensions so that most people can more comfortably stash it into a pocketbook or prop it up with one hand for long periods of time spent reading compared to the 11″-screen iPad.\n\nIt also happens to be on a rather nice sale right now at $100 off its normal price, ahead of Amazon’s Spring Sale, which begins on Tuesday, March 25. You don’t have to wait until then, though. It’s live right now.\n\nsmall ipad, smaller price, not small performance\n\nThe iPad Mini may seem, thanks to Apple’s somewhat convoluted naming system, like it’s just a smaller version of their entry-level iPad, but it straddles the line between it and the mid-range iPad Air.\n\nLike the iPad Air, it has P3 color space for a wider range of color than the base-level iPad’s sRGB color space, plus an anti-reflective screen coating. The two also share Wi-Fi 6E, a more reliably faster Wi-Fi protocol than the iPad’s Wi-Fi 6, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nThe iPad Mini’s chip splits the difference between the iPad and iPad Air M3. The 11th-generation iPad, which just came out this month, packs the Apple A16 chip, with five CPU cores and four GPU cores. The iPad Air M3, which also just came out, uses Apple’s M3 chip, and is frankly a value monster.\n\nThe iPad Mini packs an Apple A17 Pro, with one more CPU and one more GPU core than the iPad’s A16, so the diminutive iPad Mini should be not just smaller than the iPad but faster, too.\n\nLots of competing websites have claimed this deal is the lowest price ever on the 7th-generation iPad Mini. It’s correct, in a way, but for full disclosure I’d like to clarify that it’s tied for its lowest price ever. It’s been on sale for $399 several times since this past mid-January.\n\nThat said, it’s bounced back up to about $480 consistently between then and now, so it’s not a given that when you’re ready to buy an iPad Mini that it’ll be on sale for this price.\n\nThe 7th-generation iPad Mini is the latest and greatest in the iPad Mini lineup. It was just released on October 23, 2024, so it’s a fairly new machine. Finding a deal like this is likely close to as good as it’ll get, since Apple still has to make money on these things down the line.\n\nIf you’ve been holding out but are drooling over the latest iPad Mini, now’s as good a time as any to pull the trigger.",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has suffered through plenty of painful courtroom defeats during his lengthy career as one of America’s most litigious businessmen.\n\nThis time looks different. He’s now officially overdue to receive a downright brutal judicial ruling in a case that threatens to dismember his business empire, drain his cash reserves and drive him out of New York State as a businessman forever.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Aurthur Engoron blew through a self-imposed soft end-of-the-month deadline on Wednesday to deliver a judgment in the sweeping multi-million fraud lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\n\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\n\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\n\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\n\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\n\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\n\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\n\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\n\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\n\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\n\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\n\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\n\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\n\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\n\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\n\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\n\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\n\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\n\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\n\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\n\nPlay video\n\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\n\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\n\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\n\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\n\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\n\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\n\n“I spend too much time\n\nOn Twitter, following\n\nThe war—probably\n\nOn the wrong side—\n\nNothing is in me to care”\n\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\n\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\n\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\n\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\n\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\n\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\n\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\n\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\n\nJohan Floderus in a sup\n\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\n\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\n\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\n\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\n\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\n\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\n\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\n\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\n\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\n\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\n\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\n\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\n\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\n\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "A California prison is being placed under a microscope following a possible death by mail. The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\n\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\n\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage. A bill to mandate digital mail-scanning in prisons passed the Senate last year, but it stalled in the House.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "More infants died in the U.S. after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas study found increased infant mortality rates in the 18 months after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2021.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe latest study, which was penned by Parvati Singh and Dr. Maria Gallo and published in JAMA Pediatrics, built on that research. It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThe study found that infant mortality was up to seven percent higher than normal in certain months, which is equivalent to an average of 247 more deaths.\n\nThe jump was most pronounced—a 10 percent rise—among infants with congenital anomalies. That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\n\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\n\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\n\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\n\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\n\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”",

        "content": "A special court martial handed down a reprimand to an Army lieutenant colonel who was caught putting cameras in the dressing room of a clothing store by a 16-year-old girl. The Lt. Col., who fled from police when caught, pleaded guilty but will serve no jail time.\n\nThe slap on the wrist comes after civilian prosecutors initially attempted to pursue a criminal conviction. The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\n\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\n\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\n\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\n\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\n\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\n\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\n\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\n\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\n\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\n\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\n\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\n\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\n\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\n\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\n\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.",

        "content": "Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\n\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\n\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\n\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\n\nHow the Protest Was Handled\n\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\n\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\n\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\n\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\n\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\n\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\n\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\n\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\n\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\n\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\n\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.",

Allegedly, Finn’s boss at the British Bung Company had referred to him as a “stupid bald cunt.”\n\nMaybe this is my American sensibilities, but I’m thinking maybe the C-word is more of an issue here—but I digress.\n\nAccording to the panel of judges, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, the term “bald” is “inherently related to gender,” so using it against a man could breach equality laws. In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\n\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\n\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\n\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\n\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\n\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\n\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent. If people cannot joke about something a woman cannot control, then why should they be able to joke about something a man cannot control?”\n\nShrugs.",

        "content": "Does the time of the month that a baby is conceived affect if it’s a boy or a girl?\n\nIt’s possible, says British mathematician Hannah Fry.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“The chances of a woman conceiving a male or female child actually very subtly changes depending on when in her cycle she conceives,” Fry explained in a video on her Instagram page. “So slightly earlier, ever so slightly more likely that she’ll have a baby boy.”\n\nHowever, Fry said the odds are “way too small” for couples to use that as a predictor.\n\nThe larger point of her investigation was analyzing gender trends over time. With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\n\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\n\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\n\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\n\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\n\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”",

President Donald Trump has an affinity for Diet Coke—yes, you read that right—and it’s an affinity that’s so strong he built a damn button on the Oval Office desk to notify White House staffers to fill his cup up.\n\nNow, this is technically not a new thing. When he first took office in 2017 through 2021, he installed a red button—I’m imagining it looks like the ‘That Was Easy’ Staples’ button—on the desk. With him returning to the office this week, he didn’t waste any time in bringing the button back. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\n\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\n\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\n\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\n\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.",

        "content": "If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\n\nConscripted In Copenhagen\n\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\n\nNot so fast, Grandpa\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.",

To NHL.com, she added: “The year ahead is going to be a lot of fun. To carry that torch every day and keep my focus on being a coach, it definitely puts meaning into the work.”\n\nWhat is Jessica Campbell’s Background?\n\nAssistant coach Jessica Campbell of the Seattle Kraken (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nCampbell was a renowned hockey player before joining the Kraken as an assistant coach. She starred at Cornell University, where she was a team captain and hit the 100-point mark for the University.\n\nShe turned pro and spent time with the Calgary Inferno before playing internationally in Sweden.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a trailblazer in the American Hockey League as the first female coach with the Kraken’s minor league team, the Coachella Valley Firebuds. She was there from 2022 to 2024 before moving to the NHL.\n\nHow Many Women Coach in other leagues?\n\nWhile Campbell broke down the walls at the NHL level, the other three major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA) have already done so.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 season, 15 women held full-time coaching positions in the NFL.\n\nIn 2023, MLB had 43 women coaching.\n\nBecky Hammon was the first woman to serve as an acting head coach, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020.

        "content": "Another day, another creative— though failed—attempt at smuggling drugs. Colombian officials at Rafael Nunez International Airport were in for a surprise when they discovered someone attempting to get one by them through a disguise. A man was departing on an Amsterdam flight when he was footsteps away from stepping onto his plane when authorities pulled him aside because they were suspicious of… his hair.\n\nExcept it wasn’t his hair, it was a wig. While he made it through the security checkpoints and presumably thought he was in the clear, the 40-year-old dealer was monitored leading up to the boarding process. Eventually, the suspicion grew to a point where they had to step in and investigate what they suspected was a unique smuggling vessel.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nA Drug Dealer Tried to Conceal Cocaine in His Wig—And Failed\n\nPhotos from the scene showed the man’s wig being cut into and beneath it was nine cocaine capsules, according to TMZ. The black wig was able to conceal them initially before the security scanner uncovered the secret.\n\nWhen the wig was fully cut off, it showed the pods engrained in the inner part of the wig. I can’t imagine it was comfortable at all, but it nearly worked. Props to security for suspecting that something was off about the hairdo. The BBC reports that the street value of the drugs, which weighed in at 220 grams, would have equated to $10,450 U.S. dollars.\n\nColumbia is known to be the most prevalent cocaine exporter in the country, so it’s no wonder that airport security has its guard up for anything that seems out of place. Clearly, the wig set off enough alarms with officials that they tracked him throughout the airport before concluding that they needed to intervene before he headed to Amsterdam.\n\nIt’s been a busy month for wild drug dealing stories. The wig-concealing-cocaine tactic is the most interesting, but perhaps the most intricate was what came out of the Morocco and Spain border. That’s where a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered, connecting the two countries between the only land border.",

He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\n\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\n\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\n\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\n\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\n\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.",

        "content": "Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) head, Lee Zeldin announced 31 actions aimed at rolling back a number of significant environmental regulations—including reconsidering restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, rolling back vehicle emission standards aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs, and pushing to challenge a 2009 “endangerment finding” that determined greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are a threat to public health.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe agency called it the “greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Legal experts say it's a marked departure from the agency’s historic purpose to protect human health and the environment. “It's an all out assault on climate regulation and environmental and public health protections,” says Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. However, the announcement does not mean that the EPA has legal authority to institute the proposed rollbacks, experts say. “It is not within the authority of an agency to take action or to push through decisions that are directly and diametrically opposed to its mandate and the reason it was created,” says Nikki Reisch, director of Climate and Energy at the Center for International Environmental Law. While each administration has flexibility in how they enforce agency regulations, the process of outright repealing regulations is more complicated, Reisch notes. “Merely making these pronouncements from up high does not change the law,” she says. “It doesn't change the statutes that exist to protect clean air and clean water, and to protect the health of people throughout this country.”\n\nRead more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action In order to roll back a rule or regulation, the EPA would have to go through a process defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to publish notices of proposed and final rules, and provide plenty of opportunity for the public to comment on those proposed changes. “One of the signature and most important features of the process is that the agency has to make clear what it intends or proposes to do and why,” says Reisch. “It can't just disregard these and steamroll ahead with what it intended, without explaining how it has considered and addressed those comments and why it is or isn't taking them into account. And that can be a really important opportunity for the public to send a strong signal to an agency that something matters.” As part of the process, the agency would have to back its proposal with scientific evidence. Among the most significant changes the agency has proposed is a reconsideration of a 2009 finding that determined greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health—a finding that laid the foundation for much of the work the EPA has been able to do in the last 15 years.\n\nTo undo the finding, the agency would have to show that the scientific evidence is incorrect—disproving a globally accepted fact. Pollutants from greenhouse gasses reduce air quality, which increases individual risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. “They have to [prove] the previous determination, that greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change and endanger public health and welfare, was wrong or was not based on sufficient scientific evidence. And there's no basis for that. The science is quite clear, and the consensus is global,” says Burger.

But the process could take time. Meanwhile, the door is open for the administration—or corporate allies—to act in their own self interests.\n\n“It might take some months or even a year or two to get this litigated, and maybe that's what they're counting on,” says Daniel Esty, an environmental law professor at Yale University. “By ignoring [prior regulations] during the time that there's a challenge underway, they can get most of what they want.”\n\nCorrection, March 17\n\nThe original version of this story mischaracterized the power of federal agencies. They are able to roll back rules and regulations, but not statutes.",

        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "title": "Can Trump Void Biden’s Presidential Pardons?",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "On Monday, President Donald Trump signaled that he intends to nullify the presidential pardons—issued to those on the House Jan. 6 committee that investigated Trump—executed by President Joe Biden because, he said, they were signed via autopen. “The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” the President shared on his social media platform Truth Social. “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut according to the U.S. Constitution, the President has no such authority to overturn his predecessor’s pardons, especially not based on the type of signature, legal experts say. “The Constitution doesn't even require that the pardon be written, so the idea that the signature is by autopen rather than by handwritten signature seems not relevant to the constitutionality because Article II just says that the President has the power to pardon,” says Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor and constitutional law expert. Autopen is an electronic signature that allows individuals to sign a document without physically being there. The signature mimics a handwritten signature, but is done by a computer. A vast number of statutes and other documents have been signed by autopen, experts say. For instance, former President Barack Obama signed a national security measure via autopen while he was in France. Meyler says that if presidential pardons were to be invalidated because of an autopen signature, that could bring into question other policies that were signed by such measures. “When so much is being automated and put online, requiring some literalness in the signature really would be a step backwards,\" she says.\n\nA 2005 guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) noted that a President does not need to “personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.” Jeffrey Crouch, a professor at American University, told Axios that pardons are final so long as they are valid. But aside from criticizing the use of the autopen, Trump also appears to be undermining President Biden’s cognitive ability at the time such pardons were issued. “He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden,” Trump wrote on Monday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed this position during a White House briefing on Monday, when she questioned whether Biden knew his signature was on such pardons. When asked if the White House had any evidence to support such a claim, Leavitt responded, “You're a reporter, you should find out.”\n\nThese concerns were previously flagged by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who called on the DOJ to investigate Biden’s actions on March 5. “I am demanding the DOJ investigate whether President Biden’s cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval,” Bailey posted on X.\n\nIf Trump were to try to prosecute someone who received a presidential pardon, experts say the case would likely go to courts, where Trump’s actions are unlikely to stand. “I can't imagine the court saying that it wasn't a valid pardon because of the autopen issue,” says Meyler. “Biden made statements regarding these pardons, so it would be hard to show that they weren't a decision of the President.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Why is it that one high school student aces her SAT verbal section while another barely finishes the exam, scoring near the bottom of the heap? Some would say that the teenager with the high score probably benefited from an advantageous environment, parents who could afford books and who read to her as a young child, instilling a lifelong passion for all things literary. The low-scoring adolescent may not have enjoyed those same advantages and may have experienced stress due to poverty. Those who subscribe to this theory–many of whom lean left–might go so far as to say that gaps like this one are why we need more policies like universal preschool and a stronger safety net for children.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOthers, meanwhile, would say that regardless of those environmental differences, the test-score gap between the two students was probably already baked into their genes. The top scorer just had natural talents from birth, and while it may not be fair, there’s not much we can do about it. For decades, scientists have argued over whether our genes (nature) or our environment (nurture) shapes who we are. It’s one of the longest-running debates in human sciences. Are we born with certain abilities, personalities, and destinies already programmed in? Or do our experiences—the schools we attend, the books we read, the people we meet—mold us into who we become? Which one matters more? Psychologists have spent over 50 years studying this, tracking twins raised apart, adoptees, and half-siblings to estimate how much of various traits are genetic. The big takeaway? On average, human traits are about half genetic and half environmental. Height, for example, is about 80% genetic in developed countries. Personality traits are on the lower end: Around 20% heritable. Educational attainment? About 40% inherited. And when it comes to reading ability—i.e. verbal test scores—it turns out that by age 18, it’s over 80% heritable.\n\nIt would seem like the hereditarians won the debate with respect to the case of the verbal SAT section and that differences in the population are mostly due to genetics. But that framing—the idea of nature versus nurture—is all wrong. Just because some trait—like reading—is highly heritable doesn’t mean the environment doesn’t matter, it just means the environment matters in a certain way. That’s one of the insights of a new field called sociogenomics. Instead of nature competing with nurture, sociogenomics shows how genes and environment interact in ways we never fully appreciated before. Your DNA isn’t a rigid blueprint dictating your fate, and your environment isn’t just some separate force shaping you independently. Instead, genes work through the environment. Scientists have long known that nature and nurture mutually reinforce each other. But what’s new here—in the past decade, when the genomics revolution has brought oodles of data to human scientists—is that we can now study exactly how the genes for, say, reading ability, are distributed across society and how they work their magic by creating or evoking environmental conditions and responses.\n\nIt’s common sense that kids who get read to a lot tend to have better verbal skills. But why do some kids get more bedtime stories than others? Is it just luck—having parents who love books? Not quite. Kids with an innate genetic tendency toward high verbal ability naturally receive more words. They may beg for “one more story” before bed, show an early fascination with books, and develop a hunger for language. In turn, their parents—whether consciously or not—respond to this interest by reading to them more. Over time, this extra exposure leads to even better verbal skills. It’s a cycle: genes create tendencies, which shape experiences, which reinforce those same genetic tendencies. This cycle starts very early. A study that Asta Breinholt and I conducted showed that parents unknowingly invest more time and resources in kids who show early academic promise. If two average parents (say, both at the 50th percentile for genetic educational potential) happen to have a child who scores in the 60th percentile for genetic educational potential, they notice. That child, compared to a sibling who might be in the 40th percentile, gets more attention, more books, more educational experiences—as early as 18 months of age, long before any report cards have come home informing mom and dad about their kid’s talents or deficits. And then what happens? The child who was already slightly above average genetically likely ends up doing even better in school (and on the SATs)—not because the genes alone dictated success, but because those genes nudged the environment in their favor.\n\nThis means that much of what we think of as environmental is partly genes in action. A child’s genetic potential influences how parents treat them before they can even speak. And the effects can snowball—small genetic advantages may turn into big differences over time, thanks to the way the environment reacts. But that also means that genes are not destiny: If the environment niches they carve out are an important step from DNA to SAT verbal scores, then we can act on those environments for those with advantageous or disadvantageous genes. We can, for example, make sure that a kid with a high genetic risk for addiction stays away from opioids for pain management. In short, if we gain an understanding of someone’s genetic propensities, we may be able to adjust the environment in the way that most benefits them. Of course it’s not always so simple. Genes need certain environmental inputs that they seek out in order to have their effects. If that environmental feedback is blocked, due to poverty, racism, or other forces outside the control of, for instance, an individual parent, then genetic tendencies cannot be reinforced. So, even if a child has a high genetic propensity for reading ability, without the environmental element, that 80% heritability figure for verbal skills is moot.\n\nOne of the best ways to think about how all this works is to move beyond the outdated “blueprint” analogy for DNA, in which DNA is a rigid set of instructions dictating who we become. Instead imagine your brain as a machine-learning model. Your genes set the parameters—how quickly you learn, what interests you, what behaviors you’re inclined toward. But just like an algorithm, you need training data. Your experiences, social interactions, and education all feed into this system. The more exposure you have to different ideas, the more refined your \"model\" becomes. Someone who’s genetically inclined toward curiosity will seek out more information, explore new ideas, and continuously refine their worldview. Meanwhile, a genetically cautious person might be more selective about new experiences, filtering their environment differently. Over time, these genetic tendencies get reinforced by the environments we shape for ourselves. The curious kid seeks out books and interesting conversations, further sharpening their mind. The risk-averse person builds a life with stability and routine. As Joyce Carol Oates once said: “I don’t change; I become more myself.”\n\nWe can see Oates’ insight in the data. When we measure something like intelligence, we find that the genetic component becomes more predictive as we age into adulthood. At age 5, the genetic component is 45%, but by age 35, it has ballooned to 80%. As for verbal ability, the heritability rises from 48% at age 5 to over 70% by the time a kid takes the SAT. We can see a similar pattern with political views. Indeed, many, but not all, social and behavioral traits work this way. It’s like a fuzzy picture coming into focus—but that’s only made possible by “training” with our environmental interlocutors. What’s amazing is that the more we are exposed to the environment by living longer, the less the random aspects of the environment matter–the noise, so to speak–and the more our genes matter, picking and choosing the specific environmental information they incorporate into our brains. This perspective fundamentally changes how we think about human development. It’s no longer about whether nature or nurture \"wins\"—because they’re not actually in competition. Instead, genetics and environment work in a dynamic loop, each shaping the other in constant, invisible, and powerful ways that ripple across our lives.\n\nConley is the author of The Social Genome: The New Science of Nature and Nurture",

        "content": "Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

        "content": "Have you ever lost a loved one who left important words unsaid? Did you wonder if they really loved you, or did you have an argument with them right before they died? As a hospice nurse and the founder of Doulagivers Institute, and as someone who has been at the bedside of over 1,000 dying patients, I know how important it is to say everything you need to say at the end of life. That’s why I recommend that everyone, young and old, sick or healthy, write their own eulogy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday, many are rethinking what a funeral service needs to look like. Some are looking back to older traditions by readopting the practice of home wakes and funerals. Others are creating new traditions, showing that there are so many more ways to celebrate a life well-lived than the conventional options. Turning the traditional eulogy into a personally written goodbye can be an empowering and beautiful way to say “I love you” one more time. A eulogy is usually a heartfelt tribute that someone else delivers at the funeral or memorial service. Sometimes, it’s a family member or close friend, but often, it’s a clergy member who may not even know us well. As a death doula, I’ve attended many funerals. But I have never felt more love and healing at one than when a first-person eulogy is read. It’s powerful. Everyone in the room feels they get to have one last conversation with the person they’ve lost. When that conversation is filled with love, it’s the best possible salve for grief. It doesn’t mean others can’t say their own eulogies, but there’s something special about hearing directly from the person everyone misses so much.\n\nRead More: What a Hospice Nurse Wants You to Know About Death When you write your own eulogy to be read after you’re gone, it’s wonderful to know that you’ve left behind a message for everyone you love to help them get through the loss. Even if you aren’t ill and even if you’re still young, you will feel a sense of relief in knowing your eulogy is ready just in case. Of course, none of us wants to think about our death. It can be scary. But I've learned that we can release some of that fear by taking back our control—when we take care of our final plans in advance, we can feel more at ease and at peace, rather than afraid of the unknown. It can also be an opportunity to communicate life lessons you’ve amassed along the way, especially if you’re leaving behind young children or grandchildren. I know someone who wrote about working too much in his younger days before he finally learned that it was more important to spend valuable time with his family. He talked about this in his eulogy, recounting some of the memories he had with his children, wife, and parents that he wouldn’t have had if he’d been working overtime. It meant less money for exotic vacations, but as he put it, “seeing the Great Wall of China will never compare to watching my five-year-old perform in a kindergarten play.”\n\nA first-person eulogy is the perfect place to say apologies you’ve never been able to say face-to-face and bury the hatchet on any arguments before your death. For estranged relationships or those that ended in conflict, a pre-written eulogy can offer comforting closure. It can turn a sad occasion into a powerful, healing experience. Read More: Let’s Talk About Our Grief Some people use their eulogy as a chance to apologize for their very human shortcomings, assuring their loved ones that they did their best even when they fell short and that they hope the people left behind will be able to remember the good times more often than the painful ones. Most importantly, your eulogy is your occasion to express your caring and appreciation for the people you love. You can let them know how important they have been to you, what you admire about them, and what they’ve done for you that has been enormously valuable in your life. Even if you’ve already said it to them directly, saying it to them one more time after you’re gone will be enormously meaningful to them.\n\nIf you have children, telling them how proud you are will stay with them forever. I recommend being specific about it. Speak to each child about their individual strengths that you admire, and provide encouragement and confidence that they can take with them. It’s your opportunity to tell them how much you believe in them and the life they can create, despite whatever challenges they might have experienced. If your child is struggling, this can be a remarkable boost for them as they grieve.\n\nYou can’t always count on being able to say goodbye to those you love. Even in the case of a prolonged illness, you might be unconscious or too weak to do it. By writing your own first-person eulogy ahead of time, you get to say goodbye to everyone who has had an impact on you—not just family members and close friends, but also coworkers, mentors, and community members you want to remember and convey your feelings about. When you write while you’re still feeling healthy, you’ll be less likely to forget anyone, and you can always add to the list as necessary. Doing this in advance is an incredibly empowering and comforting experience that will allow you to leave nothing unsaid.",

        "content": "From December 2024 to February 2025, the effects of human-induced climate change were evident in nearly all regions of the world, new analysis from Climate Central has found. The report, which examined how climate change influenced temperatures around the world over the past three months, found that about one in five people globally—or 1.8 billion people—experienced temperatures that were strongly influenced by climate change every single day. And in half of the analyzed countries, and 287 cities around the world, the average person experienced temperatures strongly influenced by climate change for at least one-third of the three-months. The findings come as the planet breached 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures last year—a critical threshold that nations were striving to avoid under the Paris Agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We found that there were warmer than normal temperatures caused by climate change almost everywhere around the planet,” says Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central. This January ranked as the warmest in the 176-year global climate record, according to data from the U.S. National Oceanic and and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Temperatures in Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, and much of Australia and Antarctica were above average, according to data from Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Within the same three-month period analyzed, about 394 million people experienced 30 or more “risky heat days.” These are defined as days where the local temperature was hotter than 90% of daily temperatures observed between 1991-2020. Read more: Why Extreme Heat Is So Bad for the Human Body Risky heat days are “associated with a temperature threshold that carries additional risks for human health,” says Dahl. “Above that temperature, you start to see increased heat related mortality.” In February, parts of Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania all saw temperatures soar during a heat wave. Hospitals in Uganda reported an increase in heat-related illnesses, including dehydration and heat stroke, according to local news sources.\n\nThe research showed that a high number of risky heat days is far more common in the Global South: 74% of people who experienced 30 or more days of risky heat lived in Africa, while those living in Brazil, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea also saw 30 or more risky heat days.\n\n“[It] really reinforces something that we see consistently with climate change, [which] is that the people who have contributed the least to the problem are often disproportionately exposed and impacted,” says Dahl.\n\nIn the U.S., around 45% of cities analyzed experienced average temperatures that were normal or warmer-than-normal, while 14 cities, mostly in the west, experienced at least three weeks’ worth of days where average temperatures were twice as likely to be impacted by climate change.\n\n“These [findings] are just the latest reminders that climate change is happening here and now it's not something of the future,” says Dahl. “People are experiencing it every day in their lives around the world.”",

        "content": "There’s no question that the wildly popular injectable weight-loss drugs help people drop pounds, lower heart-disease risk, manage obstructive sleep apnea, and more. But as more people use these drugs, which target hormones including GLP-1, doctors are learning more about the potential downsides, as well. In the latest study published on MedRxiv—a site that hosts early research not yet peer reviewed by experts—scientists in Canada report that using GLP-1 drugs can contribute to a higher risk of hair loss, especially among women.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDr. Mohit Sodhi, a resident in emergency medicine at University of British Columbia, and his colleagues analyzed data from just over 1,900 people who were prescribed semaglutide and 1,300 who were prescribed bupropion-naltrexone—an older obesity treatment known as Contrave. Semaglutide is the compound in the drugs Ozempic, which treats diabetes, and Wegovy, which treats obesity. Sodhi focused only on people taking Wegovy to treat overweight or obesity to avoid any potential confounding effects of diabetes on hair loss. He and his team then compared the diagnoses for hair loss in these patients’ medical records and found that those prescribed semaglutide had a 50% higher risk of being diagnosed with a hair-loss condition compared to those prescribed Contrave. That risk was twice as high for women as for men. Read More: The Health Risks and Benefits of Weight-Loss Drugs\n\nHow Weight Loss Drugs Work\n\nWhile it’s not clear why semaglutide is linked to greater hair loss than older weight-loss drugs, Sodhi says scientists have some theories. The first relates to the physiological stress that the body goes through under the influence of semaglutide. The drug contributes to a higher percentage of body-mass weight loss compared to previous weight-loss medications, and accomplishes this more quickly. “Because semaglutide causes greater weight loss and more rapid weight loss than Contrave, there is more physiologic stress on the body and therefore more hair loss,” he says. Second, because the drug suppresses appetite, people who take it eat less and take in fewer nutrients, particularly protein, which is essential for hair growth. The gastrointestinal side effects associated with the drugs, which lead to nausea and vomiting, can further diminish people’s desire to eat and get the nourishment they—and their hair cells—need.\n\nIs the risk enough to discourage people from using these drugs to lose weight? That depends on why they are taking the medications—whether to treat diabetes or obesity—and how much of a health risk those health conditions pose. If you're trying to manage diabetes, “you may be more willing to accept the potential risk of hair loss than someone who may be using semaglutide to lose a few pounds to look good for an event,” Sodhi says.\n\nResults like this, and additional studies on the longer terms effects of GLP-1 drugs, are important to helping people balance the risks and benefits of these medications. “If people don’t know the potential side effects,\" says Sodhi, \"then they may be getting into something they didn’t sign up for.”",

        "content": "When I first told my friends I was spending a year improving my personality, many of them were appalled. I shouldn’t focus on changing myself, they argued. I should focus instead on changing society—or, as one friend argued, I should focus on fighting the patriarchy, the real source of all our problems. I agree that the patriarchy is bad, and that it now seems more virulent than ever, along with a slew of other problems. Every time I look at my phone, I see numerous issues that merit urgent attention: climate change, the creep of authoritarianism, income inequality, and the erosion of reproductive rights, to name just a few. But despite all of these issues, I believe people can and should still prioritize self-improvement and personal growth. It’s a good time to change yourself, even if you feel like the world is on fire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nI was pursuing personality change because, according to research, doing so can make you happier— people who rank higher in traits like conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are more successful and content. The reality is that most of us have much more control over our own lives and behaviors than we do over the actions of policymakers or the president. While it’s good to get involved politically, frustrating and disappointing things will probably continue to occur. “Things happen that you don’t like” was my meditation teacher’s refrain. Of course, this isn’t the first time that, in the face of overwhelming global events, it’s felt tempting to do nothing. A few years ago, it became fashionable to argue that it’s impossible to function “under capitalism.” But as the writer Clare Coffey pointed out, “any serious attempt to topple capitalism would require more discipline, more courage, more endurance, more capability, not less.”\n\nThe same applies for those attempting to resist Trumpism now. Changing the way you respond to adversity can both improve your life and make you more effective when you do try to take on systemic change. Read More: Why I’m Replacing Doomscrolling With Poetry Living through a time of tariffs, deportations, and government layoffs is anxiety-inducing, but shifting the way you react to these types of stressors can make you less anxious and better able to adapt when misfortune inevitably comes for you. Some of the techniques to become less neurotic involve thinking about looming threats more realistically, savoring the good things about life, and acknowledging that positive outcomes are still possible. These kinds of mindset changes can help loosen the grip of anxiety so that you can better take action. And what will those actions be? Perhaps, if you’re a laid-off federal worker, it will mean looking for a job in a new industry or sector. Maybe it will be calling your representatives, attending peaceful protests, or organizing in your community. But all of those steps first require mental health and fortitude.\n\nVolumes of research have shown that people who have higher well-being—who are happier, or less anxious—are better at whatever it is they set out to do. One 2021 study that followed nearly a million U.S. Army soldiers over five years found that the happiest among them won four times as many awards for performance or heroism as the unhappiest, even when controlling for a range of demographic characteristics. They were more effective because they felt better. Those who oppose Trump are facing a long four years. But we can’t fight for the changes we want if we’re falling apart. Now is the right time to strengthen our inner resolve as much as our outer determination. Psychological research suggests that agency—the sense that you can create a positive difference in the world, or at least in your life—is linked to reduced levels of depression and helplessness. “Agency causes progress,” the positive-psychology pioneer Martin Seligman has said, while “lack of agency causes stagnation.” Agency imbues you with the sense that you can do something about your problems.\n\nI noticed the invigorating nature of agency while conducting my own personality experiment. As I became more comfortable with outgoing activities like improv class, I started to fear them less, and I even relished them a little. I grew less intimidated by work assignments that required me to speak publicly or to perform in front of crowds. I started to believe that I could handle most things. I grew so confident and hopeful, in fact, that after years of indecision, I finally decided to try to have a baby (and did so.) I would have preferred to give him a perfect world—but instead, I gave him this one.\n\nThings will happen that we don’t like, but we can still live in a way that we do like—and tackle whatever it is we deem most important. In all likelihood, Gandhi never actually said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.” The closest he came was to argue that, “As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. ... We need not wait to see what others do.” For those seeking to change their own natures, you need not wait for a better world.",

        "title": "Every Disney Live-Action Remake, Ranked",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Some things in life are inevitable: death, taxes, and Disney remaking their animated studio classics into live-action films. It’s no surprise why the studio has been so willing to remake so many of its originals: money talks. Despite being largely dismissed by critics, pretty much every film has raked in the big bucks. Four of the remakes—The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland, and Aladdin—have eclipsed $1 billion at the worldwide box office, with most of the other theatrical releases grossing well over $500 million. That could explain why Disney has so many more remakes in the pipeline, including Lilo & Stitch, Moana Hercules, Bambi, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, to name a few.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe’re only ranking the films that are direct remakes of the Disney classics, so sequels including Mufasa: The Lion King and spin-offs like Cruella are not included here. Perhaps the biggest factor in ranking these 16 films is how they deal with the source material. How well do these stories translate to live-action? Are they mere carbon copies, or do they use their animated inspiration to expand on stories audiences have loved for decades? As Snow White, based on Disney’s first-ever animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, releases in cinemas this weekend, we’ve ranked every Disney live-action remake to see which one’s got the most pixie dust. 16. The Lion King (2019)\n\nDirected by Jon Favreau, The Lion King is hyperrealistic to a fault—while the animal cast looks great, they’re incapable of emoting. That renders every emotional moment (what made the original Lion King so terrific) utterly lifeless. Turning one of the studio’s all-time classics into a complete bore is remarkable. Disney doesn’t even know how to classify this oddity, calling it live-action, despite only one of the 1,600-plus shots being non-computer generated. And though it feels like a (bad) copy of the original, it inexplicably adds an extra half an hour. (The sequel, Mufasa: The Lion King improves slightly on the emoting issue, but it's still not much better). The single most pointless remake in the Disney canon. 15. Pinocchio (2022)\n\nThere’s plenty of pedigree behind the remake of Pinocchio, with director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo and Luke Evans starring. In reality, it’s got straight-to-video (or Disney+) written all over it. Accents are wildly inconsistent, everyone seems bored, and the effects were dated the moment this premiered in 2022. The new songs are forgettable, and there’s a host of new characters (including a talking seagull and a puppeteer) that do nothing but weigh things down. 14. Mulan (2020)\n\nMulan is a fascinating study of removing everything that gave the original film its excitement—the rousing musical numbers, the lively supporting cast—transforming it into a pale Wuxia imitation. Credit where it’s due: 2020’s Mulan does do something new with the story, harkening back to the original folklore (granted, it does this poorly). Unfortunately, that does not stop it from being extremely boring.\n\n13. Peter Pan & Wendy (2023)\n\nDavid Lowery’s dreamlike filmmaking style makes him a smart candidate to retell the timeless tale of Peter Pan in Peter Pan & Wendy. But this is by some distance Lowery’s biggest miss. Performances range from bad to worse (Jude Law as Captain Hook is permanently running on fumes), Neverland is a dreary landscape of muted greens and browns, and the story becomes an insipid take on an adventurous classic. 12. Alice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nTim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland is endlessly exhausting, with the cast coming off as unbearable and obnoxious as possible. It does have a unique visual style, but it's an exceptionally ugly one; effectively turning the Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter) into a bobblehead is just one of the many baffling decisions made within. This is a film that takes the quirky absurdism of Lewis Carrol’s book and the 1951 Disney film and drives it off a cliff. The sequel, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is more of the same. At least it’s bright and colorful! 11. The Little Mermaid (2023)\n\nHalle Bailey makes a sensational Ariel. Her inquisitive instincts and powerhouse vocals breathe new life into the wonderful “Part of Your World.” Everything else around Bailey, sadly, is a mess. The underwater visuals are frustrating and sterile—comparing the 1989 version of “Under the Sea” to this one, for example, is depressing. The new songs leave a lot to be desired, especially “Scuttlebutt,” a strong contender for the worst Disney song ever. The scenes on land, surprisingly, are much livelier. But this is a shockingly bloated version of the Disney classic. At 135 minutes, it's nearly an hour longer than the original, and you feel every minute of that excess.\n\n10. Lady and the Tramp (2019)\n\nThe best part of Lady and the Tramp is its use of real dogs instead of rendering them into CG horrors. They add plenty of personality to a film sorely lacking in it. It’s weirdly slight, like the whole thing was an afterthought, a shame since the dogs deliver plenty of charm. There’s a reason the 1955 version is a perfectly paced 75 minutes long; it’s a straightforward story, and the choice to add an entire half an hour without adding anything of substance makes this challenging to get through. 9. Beauty and the Beast (2017)\n\nEmma Watson does make a charming Belle, even if she’s not a particularly gifted singer.\n\nGarish, over-the-top, and bloated, 2017’s Beauty and the Beast feels particularly pointless, staying incredibly close to the original while still managing to weigh it down in unnecessary music and unwelcome character developments (why is the Beast so unlikeable this time around?) and an overreliance on computer-generated characters. 8. Aladdin (2019)\n\nGuy Ritchie was the right person to helm the Aladdin remake, and the film captures some of the original’s giddy, irreverent sense of humor. That’s not to say it’s a particularly good film. It’s forgettable, and the performances leave plenty to be desired (save for Naomi Scott, who adds a nice fire to Jasmine). The musical numbers are stilted too, with characters just kind of hanging around while singing—a massive step down from the exuberant, layered choreography of the 1992 classic.\n\n7. Maleficent (2014)\n\nSwitching the perspective of 1959’s Sleeping Beauty from Princess Aurora (she only had 18 spoken lines) to the beloved villain Maleficent is a great idea. Angelina Jolie makes a great villain, but the film's efforts to over-explain the source of her evil is frustrating. Even worse is the reason: she’s evil because a boy betrayed her. Some people are just bad, and that’s okay! The film turns a legendary screen icon and makes her rather generic, thanks to flat dialogue and heavy plotting. Still, it looks great and Anna B. Sheppard’s costumes are wonderfully detailed. (The 2019 sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, is tough to get through.)\n\n6. The Jungle Book (2016)\n\nOne of cinema’s best examples of blending live-action and computer-generated imagery, The Jungle Book, looks fantastic. The lush, immersive jungle is made with computers, and the film was filmed entirely in Los Angeles. It’s no wonder the film won the Oscar for visual effects. But the story is great too, expanding on the 1967 version in interesting ways while bringing some fun new characters into the mix. It’s not always cohesive and the world-building is messy, but the fantastic creature design and ingenious casting of Idris Elba as Shere Khan and Bill Murray as the carefree Baloo more than makes up for it.\n\n5. Snow White (2025)\n\nMarc Webb’s Snow White forges its own path from Disney’s first feature-length animated film, making the titular princess (Rachel Zegler) far more assertive rather than reactive. The new songs are mostly decent, and Zegler’s big solo number “Waiting For A Wish” is a terrific new “I Want” classic. It’s not all bright red apples: Gadot makes for an uninspiring Evil Queen, and the CG dwarfs, a choice which drew complaints even before the movie premiered, are badly rendered and unpleasant to look at. But Zegler’s sensitive, effective performance as Snow White gives new life to the classic princess. Thankfully, Snow White more than justifies its existence, and when it comes to these live-action remakes, that’s a pretty big deal.\n\n4. 101 Dalmatians (1996)\n\nThe first of Disney’s live-action remakes before Alice in Wonderland started another wave, 101 Dalmatians is tons of cheesy fun. This is a film that exists entirely to support a brilliant, go-for-broke performance from Glenn Close, who channels a fabulous manic energy as Cruella De Vil. In pure high camp glory, Close vamps around, and every moment with her on screen is a blast. She’s terrifying, yet accessible to young audiences. The main romance is dull, but there’s plenty of fun slapstick and creative set-pieces in John Hughes’ script to make up for it. There’s plenty of silly family fun to enjoy in 101 Dalmatians. (The less said about the misguided sequel, 102 Dalmatians, the better, though it's miles better than Cruella).\n\n3. Dumbo (2019)\n\nTim Burton’s second outing in the Disney live-action remakes is a far better fit for his talents. Dumbo often feels like an entirely different movie than the 1941 animated masterpiece, and that’s a very good thing indeed. The human cast is impressive; Michael Keaton shines as a ruthless amusement park owner who exploits Dumbo, and Danny DeVito is spirited as a circus ringmaster with a heart of gold. The titular elephant looks fantastic and is almost unbearably adorable, and the excellent production design brings the world of the circus to haunting life. 2. Cinderella (2015)\n\nDirector Kenneth Branagh brings an epic scale to the intimate story of Cinderella in the welcome 2015 remake. It’s one of the best-cast live-action remakes; Cate Blanchett makes for a menacing evil stepmother in Lady Tremaine, and Lily James channels Cinderella’s longing and optimism beautifully. It looks and feels expensive—the sets are grand and wondrous, and the costumes immaculately detailed. But it’s the little things in Chris Weitz’s script that make Cinderella so worthwhile, like the expansion of the King (Derek Jacobi), whose backstory adds a poignant touch to the proceedings.\n\n1. Pete’s Dragon (2016)\n\nPete’s Dragon is a perfect candidate for remake opportunities, which is to say the original 1977 film isn’t particularly good. David Lowery takes the few elements that worked—mainly the special kinship between a boy and a dragon—and injects his own unique vision into the proceedings. The result is something that feels like a complete departure from the original: a touching ‘80s throwback and an effective coming-of-age drama about Pete (Oakes Fegley), a lonely boy who inhabits the forest with his dragon named Elliot. Compassionate, tender, and dreamlike, this is the one Disney remake that stands head-and-shoulders above the material that inspired it.",

        "title": "Deportations Put US ‘Beyond’ Constitutional Crisis: Expert",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration appeared to openly defy multiple court orders over the weekend, deepening concerns among Democrats and legal experts that the constitutional crisis many feared when President Donald Trump was elected has now arrived. On Saturday, federal officials ignored an order from Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who had directed the government to turn around deportation flights carrying Venezuelan detainees. Instead, the planes continued on their course to El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally, boasted that the 238 detainees would be held for at least a year in the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center. “Oopsie … Too late,” Bukele wrote on social media, a post later amplified by White House officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed gratitude to the Salvadoran president, pointedly ignoring the judge’s ruling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA day earlier, in Boston, a similar scenario played out. A federal judge had issued a restraining order to block the deportation of Rasha Alawieh, a Brown University medical professor with a valid visa returning from a family visit to Lebanon. Despite the order, she was deported anyway. Taken together, the incidents suggest that the Trump Administration is increasingly willing to brush aside judicial authority in pursuit of its policy goals. It follows a pattern in which Trump and his allies have sought to test the limits of judicial power, sometimes circumventing rulings, other times attacking judges outright. The country is “far beyond” a constitutional crisis, says Kim Wehle, a law professor at the University of Baltimore and a former assistant U.S. attorney. “A constitutional crisis is the accumulation of unchecked power in one branch. We’ve seen now for weeks the Trump Administration ignoring acts of Congress,” says Wehle, noting that the President has ignored Congress’ constitutional power of the purse by withholding federal funds and by terminating federal employees and senior officials without cause.\n\nOther legal scholars, while alarmed, hesitate to label the administration’s actions as an outright crisis. Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia, describes the administration as challenging the courts thus far up to a point. “I don’t want to call it a constitutional crisis because I’m waiting to see them say in their own words, ‘We will not comply with court orders anymore,’” says Frost, who is the director of UVA’s Immigration, Migration, and Human Rights Program. “They have yet to say that. And while they’ve done some things to violate corners of the margins, they have so far followed along.” She adds, “I’m very concerned and think they’re being very disingenuous…but I would not say that they have yet crossed the line of suggesting they no longer feel that they need to abide by the rule of law.” Yet signs of open defiance are emerging. White House officials have said the judge’s order came after planes carrying the Venezuelan migrants had already left the U.S. Tom Homan, Trump’s White House “border czar,” dismissed the weekend’s rulings, telling Fox News on Monday that the court orders had come too late to make a difference.\n\n“We’re not stopping,” Homan said. “I don’t care what the judges think.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked to clarify those comments Monday afternoon, insisted that the Administration is complying with the court order, even though the planes with Venezuelan deportees landed in El Salvador hours after the judge gave verbal instructions to Justice Department attorneys that the flights must return to the U.S. “We are quite confident in that, and we are wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court,” Leavitt told reporters. She also said there are “questions about whether a verbal order carries the same weight as a … written order.” Federal judges are now weighing how to respond to cases that may end up before the Supreme Court. Judge Boasberg scheduled a Monday evening hearing to determine whether the administration defied his ruling. In Massachusetts, Judge Leo T. Sorokin has demanded an explanation from the government for why Dr. Alawieh was deported in apparent violation of his order.\n\nThe Administration says it invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798—a wartime law rarely used in modern history—to deport Venezuelans who the government say belong to the Tren de Aragua gang, without due process. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled against the administration’s use of emergency powers, including on immigration and border security, yet officials have continued to push forward in ways that some see as ignoring or undermining the judiciary’s authority. In the case of Dr. Alawieh, who is Lebanese, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that she “openly admitted” to CBP officers her support for a Hezbollah leader and attended their funeral. “A visa is a privilege not a right—glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” the statement said. “This is commonsense security.” The official White House account on X said: “Bye-bye, Rasha” with a hand waving emoji. Alawieh was sent back to Lebanon, even though the judge ordered on Friday that she be kept in the U.S. and brought to a court hearing on Monday.\n\nLegal scholars warn that if courts allow such defiance to go unpunished, the judiciary’s ability to serve as a check on executive power could be permanently weakened. “There is an accumulation of power in one place,” Wehle says. “That means Donald Trump becomes the law. The law is what he sees the law to be. He picks and chooses winners and losers.”\n\n\n\n“The checks and balances are gone,” she adds.\n\nThe Trump Administration is working aggressively to shape public perception of both the deportations and its defiance of the courts as wins for the American people. Social media posts from administration officials and pro-Trump influencers have celebrated the deportations. One post showed a video of shackled men being led onto the planes, accompanied by Semisonic’s 1998 song “Closing Time.”",

        "content": "On March 5, news broke that the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut 80,000 jobs. The move is unsurprising considering the Trump Administration and its Department of Government Efficiency’s ongoing efforts to shred the federal workforce. However, Trump Administration officials have sharply departed from past practices and downplayed the impact of these cuts on veterans. In an interview with PBS News Hour, for example, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins dismissed former U.S. Marine Jeremy Cope’s claims that staff shortages are leading to cancelled meetings for veterans struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues. It’s “just a piece of journalism that's not doing its job,” Collins responded.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe secretary’s response is antithetical to how his predecessors have approached veterans’ care for almost two centuries. In the earliest iterations of federal care for aging and disabled former service members, officials saw achieving a balance between the desire for efficiency and the need to provide American veterans with comfort and good care as not only possible, but essential. When the quest for efficiency upended this balance in the past, previous administrations have listened to veterans who objected. If the Trump Administration begins to focus on maximizing efficiency at any cost, and ignores warnings about how it weakens care, they will be ignoring a formula that has governed since the 19th century. Read More: Trump’s Massive Cuts to the VA Betrays Veterans Like Me In 1826, Congress authorized plans to build the U.S. Naval Asylum, the nation’s first federal residence for aging and disabled veterans, in Philadelphia. Even before the asylum opened, federal officials, officers, and private citizens with whom the government contracted attempted to create a facility that materially comforted veteran residents, while also maintaining austerity with public funds.\n\nIn December 1829, William Strickland, the architect designing the facility, acknowledged this balancing act in a report to Congress. He labeled the building a “commodious and magnificent edifice,” one that would demonstrate “that the nation is not unmindful of the debt” it owed to its veterans. Despite, the construction already costing nearly $200,000 (more than $6 million today), the architect stressed that he had respected his budget to the best of his ability and made the case that cost of completing the project would be closer to $242,000. In comparing the project to other architectural and engineering endeavors, Strickland explained, “I am not aware that, in this country or in Europe, the same quantity of labor and materials has been procured by government or individuals, by the expenditure of so small an amount of money.” Once the institution opened in 1833 with space for more than 400 veterans, naval officers endeavored to provide a comfortable life for the residents. That included outfitting them with a full wardrobe. By 1843, veterans regularly received navy blue jackets, pairs of cotton and linen trousers, flannel drawers and shirts, socks, pairs of shoes, white and checked cotton shirts, silk and cotton handkerchiefs, and hats. At less regular intervals, officials provided a quality suit and a thick pea jacket.\n\nYet, even as the Naval Asylum’s officers made sure to provide high quality and complete wardrobes to its residents, they and officials in Washington maintained the expectation that federal dollars would be spent efficiently. Naval Asylum Governor William McKean spent considerable time selecting the best fabric available at the fairest price. Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur dictated limits on the cost of clothing. The Navy Department, he said, could spend the equivalent of roughly $1300 in 2025 dollars on the entire wardrobe for each resident. As more veterans entered the Naval Asylum in the 1830s and 1840s, officials’ attempted to use space more efficiently. After 1839, the building held three separate institutions: the Naval Asylum for veterans, a hospital for current naval sailors, and a small school for midshipmen—a predecessor to the Naval Academy in Annapolis. Officials believed that by using one structure to fulfill separate functions, they would save the federal government money.\n\nThe move, however, backfired. It precipitated a decline in the quality of life for veterans, who then protested. They petitioned for a reorganization of the facility to better serve their needs. The residents’ objections clued officials in that their quest for balancing efficiency and quality of care had faltered and begun compromising the veterans’ experience at the Naval Asylum. Officials responded by meeting some of the veterans’ demands and embarking on an expansion project. They rehired Strickland to build two residences on either side of the main structure for the institution’s governor and head surgeon who at the time occupied apartments in the main building. The scope of work also involved constructing walls around the property, erecting two gatehouses, and all the related excavation, drainage work, and paving. The official estimate for the digging, walls, and gatehouses was $20,333, or nearly $1 million dollars today. Despite the hefty price tag, Governor Charles W. Morgan explained in reports to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery that the expenditure would secure both the “efficiency and comfort of the establishment.” To the governor, these two functions were both critical at the asylum.\n\nAround this time, Morgan also suggested removing the midshipmen to a separate institution. Because officers had begun housing the young men in “expensive hotels” in the city and veterans complained of the school impacting their care, the move would not only appease current residents but also save the department money in the long term and create dozens of vacancies for more veterans. Read More: 80,000 Veterans Affairs Staffers Are on DOGE's Chopping Block The officials understood that while establishing a new institution for midshipmen and constructing new buildings would cost more up front, in this instance, it would create a more effective federal government—one that acknowledged when to prioritize quality care over restrictive spending. Lavish expenditures and good intentions sometimes led to fiscal waste and failed to ensure that all of the veterans who lived at the Naval Asylum had a positive experience. Sometimes residents stole clothing from their comrades, sold it, and pocketed the profits. Officers locked disorderly veterans like these in the cells on the asylum’s top story. Water regularly seeped through the structure’s basement and windows, requiring funds for near constant maintenance.\n\nBut even when the quality of care did not match their intentions, officials maintained a commitment to providing it and listening to the veterans in their care, even as they also respected the budgets funded by Congress. For this reason, appropriations for construction, renovations, and provisions at the Naval Asylum property continued for well over a century until 1988, when the federal government finally sold the land and remaining buildings to a private development firm. The fact that Strickland’s original structure remains standing as the anchor of Philadelphia’s Naval Square community almost 200 years after its construction is a testament to the emphasis on quality care for veterans, even if that meant eschewing maximal efficiency. Federal officials cared about avoiding waste, but they sought a balance, and didn’t see responsible budgeting and quality care as mutually exclusive. In fact, they saw the two as inherently intertwined parts of the job of the federal government.\n\nThis history suggests that steep staffing cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs would be antithetical to how the U.S. has cared for veterans for nearly two centuries. It also highlights that cuts do not necessarily mean responsible stewardship of public money. Finally, this history demonstrates the benefits of listening to veterans and staff who warn of efficiency’s consequences. When it comes to veterans, the federal government can and has long strived for efficiency and the highest quality care at the same time.\n\nMoyra Williams Eaton is a Ph.D. candidate in the department of history at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face. When I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point. After her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.” The 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "content": "BANGKOK — China’s energy and auto giant BYD has announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says is nearly as quick as a fill up at the pumps. BYD, China's largest EV maker, said Monday that its flash-chargers can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, similar to the amount of time needed to fill a fuel tank. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China. Charging times and limited ranges have been a major factor constraining the switch from gas and diesel vehicles to EVs, though Chinese drivers have embraced that change, with sales of battery powered and hybrid vehicles jumping 40% last year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBYD's news appeared to give Tesla a jolt on Monday, as the U.S. EV maker's share price sank 4.8%.

Ultra-high voltage and a large current are required to maximize charging speeds, BYD's founder Wang Chuanfu said in a statement. “To completely solve users' anxiety over charging, our pursuit is to make the charging time for EVs as short as the refueling time for fuel vehicles,” Wang said. The company also said that its flash-charging system relies on silicon carbide power chips with voltage levels of up to 1,500V that it developed on its own. Its Blade lithium-iron phosphate battery is perhaps the world's safest and most efficient EV battery, with Tesla opting to use it in some of its EVs, industry analyst Michael Dunne said in a recent report.\n\nBYD reported it made just over 4.3 million “new energy vehicles” last year, up 41% from a year earlier, including 1.8 million battery electric vehicles and 2.5 million plug in hybrids. The price of its shares traded on China's smaller market in Shenzhen has surged nearly 50% in the past six months.\n\nRead more: Here’s How Tesla’s Sales Have Been Hit Around the World\n\nWhile BYD's fanciest, latest premium models are expected to sell for up to about $40,000, it also makes much less expensive EVs including the Seagull, which sells for around $12,000 in China.\n\nBYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla's 1,773,443.\n\nIn early January, Tesla said its sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and BYD gained market shares with competitive EVs.\n\nBut BYD has weaknesses as well, Dunne said, noting that JD Power's 2024 China New Energy Vehicle Initial Quality Study ranked the BYD Seal and BYD Song Plus battery electrics at the bottom of its rankings.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Rep. Jake Auchincloss's Massachusetts district is so safe he didn't even face a Republican opponent in 2024. So while some of his Democratic colleagues are focused on the careful messaging needed to appease swing voters or keep their purple seats, Auchincloss, 37, is fixated on the broader question facing his party: what are the big ideas that Democrats can offer the American people? TIME spoke to the rising House Democrat about owning up to the party's COVID-era mistakes, getting tough on social-media companies, building new cities, and what the Democratic vision of the future should be.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. What went wrong for Democrats, and how can it be fixed? It's encapsulated in the school closures. The school closures were a catastrophe. Those are elementary school kids who didn't learn reading and writing because it was on Zoom. That's high school kids who missed out on baseball practice. That's college kids who didn't get to enjoy the college experience. And what defined those school closures was a condescension, it was an inflexibility, and it was a resistance to feedback about the effects of our government’s decisions. It was this toxic confluence of smugness with inflexibility, and frankly, poor governance. Democrats need to acknowledge that we were wrong as a party on our stance on school closures. It's not enough to say we were wrong on this. We also have to have a plan of action for how we're gonna remediate it. What do you think that plan should be?\n\nI think it's twofold. One is we should make a commitment of one-on-one, high-dosage tutoring for every kid who's behind grade level in this country. We know it's one of the few educational interventions that are rigorously tested for efficacy. It's scalable, it's complimentary to the work that teachers are already doing, and we should be saying as a matter of party principle: every single kid who's behind grade level, Democrats are here to ensure that they get one-on-one, high-dosage tutoring. The second thing we should do is hold the social-media corporations to account for their generational attention fracking of our youth. I have legislation that's bipartisan to revoke Section 230, and make social-media corporations accountable to a duty of care for things like deepfake pornography that target young women. But we gotta go even further, and tax the daylights out of these social-media corporations. A 50% tax rate on all digital advertising that they accrue on the revenues. And use it to fund initiatives like local journalism and education.\n\nDoes the party need a new direction? What should that direction be? That's the core challenge we have. It's that we are bereft of big ideas. And that's what I'm worried about. Everyone's focused on ‘we need a new message frame’ or ‘we need we need a new angle’ or ‘we need new leaders to emerge.’ I can assure you there is no shortage of ambition out there, candidates will emerge. There's a shortage of ideas. It's all kind of hand waving unless you actually have some big ideas. Let's put the big ideas out there. Let's talk about them. Let's see what people will get excited about. And then organically, I think a narrative starts to emerge from that. And this is to a certain extent what MAGA did and Donald Trump did. He came out talking about 'build the wall,' right? We forget, ‘build the wall’ was the foundation of MAGA, which has since engendered many other ideas and narratives. But you can see why it's kind of the intellectual genesis of that movement.\n\nSo what should be the Democrats’ next big ideas? Let me put a few more out there. We have got to stop focusing on expanding health-care coverage and focus instead on lowering health-care costs. Community health clinics account for about,1% of U.S. health care spending, but they treat 10% of Americans. They are primary and preventative care and if they could team up with hospitals in particular, they can be incredibly effective stewards of health care dollars. We have to start subsidizing them directly, as opposed to what we currently do, which is subsidize the health-insurance companies. For 15 years we’ve been subsidizing health-insurance companies, and they keep on telling us everyone's going to get healthier, and all I see is that they get richer. How do we subsidize these community health centers? How about a value-added tax on junk food, in the way that the Navajo Nation has. The Navajo Nation put a tax on junk food. It's modest, but they've used it to fund wellness initiatives. We could do that nationally.\n\nSo in the same way that we tie the attention tax to fund journalism and education, we tie the tax on junk food towards radically expanding funding to community health centers. So that everybody under 300% of the federal poverty rate has access to primary and preventative care. What should be at the core of Democrats’ economic agenda? Cost Disease needs to be the centerpiece. Our Democratic economic agenda really could be seven words: \"treat cost disease and protect Social Security.\" What is cost disease? Can you explain it to me like I’m five? Let’s use two examples to explain it. The average family spends relatively less on TVs and electronics and relatively more on health care than they did 50 years ago. Why did that happen? The reason is that in sectors where they are able to do at-scale product manufacturing, the cost goes way down. In sectors that are very labor intensive, costs tend to go up over time. TVs got really cheap to make, and so a relative share of your budget they went down. Health care is very labor intensive, child care is very labor intensive, and so they, as a relative share of your budget, go up.\n\nThe goal then, if we're serious about treating cost disease in housing and health care, which are the two sectors that are most affected by it, is: how do you turn a service into a product and then how do you mass produce that product? What does that mean for housing? We totally have to do land-use reform. We gotta make it easier to build. I'm here in Massachusetts, and it’s impossible to build in this state with our zoning code. But we also have to figure out how to turn housing construction from a very service-intensive endeavor into a product. And we actually know how to do that: offsite construction. One way to break through is for us to get serious about building new cities in this country that just totally bypassed the local zoning issue, right? Americans used to build new cities every time we ran into a river. We stopped building new cities, but they're very important ways to foment economic dynamism and mobility. We've got lots of decommissioned military bases that are not locally zoned, federal land that's not locally zoned. Let's invest in building new cities there, and it’ll open up lots of opportunities.\n\nWhat other big ideas do you have? We need to get rid of the primary system. Get rid of the primary system like California did or Alaska did, try to limit the influence of big money like Maine is trying to do. Every state should be pushing for those reforms and Democrats should be leading the charge there. Because what that does is it unlocks the power of the median voter. Right now, of 435 members of Congress, only 35 of them are oriented towards the median voter. The other 400 are oriented towards their primaries. So if you take all these big ideas together and package them, how would you describe them? How would you explain this worldview to somebody if you didn’t have time to go through each idea step by step? It's a great question, but I'm gonna reject the debate, actually. I am insistent that right now, we need to be talking about the ideas, the merits of the ideas. I am sure that some people will agree with what I'm putting forward. Some people will disagree. We need to be seeing what excites people. What actually galvanizes the electorate? What do people see as relevant to their lives?\n\nWhat I'm very skeptical of is this top-down approach where the pollsters or the storytelling maestros of Democratic circles say, ‘this message is what works, it’s about fighting for the working class,’ or whatever. Voters can tell.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.",

        "title": "Why Imposter Syndrome Isn’t a Personal Flaw",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dunn, a former practicing attorney, professor, and nonprofit executive, is a consultant focusing on systemic equity, diversity, and inclusion. She is the author of Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work\n\nThe term “imposter syndrome” has become a cultural shorthand for self-doubt. We’re told it’s something to fix within ourselves: a nagging belief that we’re unqualified or unworthy, even when all evidence points to the contrary. Yet for many women—and especially women of color—this framing misses the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, what’s labeled as imposter syndrome in the workplace is often a misdiagnosis—a symptom of systemic inequities. It’s a response to environments steeped in bias, exclusion, and relentless scrutiny of the competence of women, Black professionals, and other people of color, a practice known as “competency checking.” Competency checking—whether intentional or unconscious—undermines those who challenge traditional norms of leadership and success. Imposter syndrome, however, masquerades as an internal failing, leading women to pathologize themselves rather than confront the systems perpetuating their struggles.\n\nThis misidentification was never clearer to me than during a conversation with a prospective client—a white woman—about a keynote speech on imposter syndrome. I explained my view: imposter syndrome is a catch-all term that obscures the real culprits—sexism, racism, and white supremacy. It can set up women to blame themselves for what is actually persistent, systemic competency checking.\n\nThe woman was visibly taken aback. She said that none of the consultants she had spoken with framed the issue this way, and one consultant had even claimed that “Everyone has imposter syndrome, and anyone who says they don’t is a liar or a narcissist.” This reductive and harmful framing shocked me. Imposter syndrome isn’t recognized as a psychiatric disorder; it’s not listed in the DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. Yet the notion that everyone suffers from it has become pervasive.\n\nRead More: Yes, Impostor Syndrome Is Real. Here’s How to Deal With It\n\nI explained to her that feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty are part of being human. But these feelings differ from the systemic barriers and biases that create environments where women—and especially women of color—are made to feel unworthy. Black women, for instance, often reject the idea that they are imposters. Instead, they focus on the challenges of working within systems not designed for their success. This difference in perception can create friction with white women, who may frame these struggles through a lens of personal failings, a narrative that imposter syndrome encourages.\n\nCiting global inclusion strategist Ruchika Malhotra and writer Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome,” I emphasized that self-doubt often reflects a rational response to systemic bias. As Malhotra and Burey put it, “Impostor syndrome directs our view toward fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work.”\n\nUnmasking the villain\n\nI often use a metaphor inspired by Scooby-Doo to explain this dynamic. In every episode, Scooby and the gang unmask a ghostly villain, revealing it to be someone using fear to hide their schemes. Imposter syndrome is a similar mask, obscuring systemic inequities that fuel self-doubt. Once the mask is removed, the real question is: How did we get here, and why do so many—particularly white women—believe the ghost is real?\n\nThe origins of the term “impostor phenomenon,” coined in 1978, offer clues. Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes described the experiences of 178 predominantly white, upper-middle-class women who felt intellectually fraudulent despite their achievements. The study framed their feelings as internal failings rather than responses to external pressures, such as patriarchy and white supremacy, which drive perfectionism. It overlooked the realities of sexism, classism, and racism—and the complex interplay of these forces.\n\nIf the study had included women of color, working-class white women, or others excluded from its narrow lens, it might have painted a different picture. Take Crystal Lee Sutton, the real-life inspiration for the movie Norma Rae. In 1978, when Sutton stopped her work and famously stood up on a table in the mill to protest the impact of unchecked capitalism, sexism, and racism on the poor and working-class women who worked there, she didn’t hold up a sign saying she felt like an imposter; she held up a sign that said “UNION.”\n\nThere must have been days when Sutton felt uncertain or even like a fraud—not because of a clinical disorder but because she was human. Yet she identified the real culprit: The systemic exploitation of working poor women. Sutton understood that change required building a coalition of white and Black women to challenge the status quo. She correctly identified the external factors—and fought back with the right medicine: solidarity.\n\nReimagining the solution\n\nTo move beyond imposter syndrome, we must reframe it as a systemic issue rather than an individual failing. Workplaces must become environments where microaggressions, implicit bias, and inequitable opportunities are actively dismantled. Women must recognize that self-doubt often reflects competency checking, not their actual abilities.\n\nSolidarity is crucial. Women of all backgrounds must come together to challenge the status quo, building coalitions that center the experiences of the most marginalized. Organizations, too, must reassess how they evaluate candidates for hiring and promotion: Are hidden biases baked into the criteria used to measure competence? And how do these biases disproportionately affect women and people of color?\n\nMoving toward collective action\n\nImposter syndrome thrives in isolation, convincing women that they alone are flawed. But the solution lies in collective action. By addressing the systemic roots of competency checking, we can create workplaces where self-doubt doesn’t hinder potential, and no one is punished for their confidence or ambition.\n\nWhite women must recognize that their successes and burdens are intertwined with those of women of color. The fight against competency checking isn’t just about individual self-improvement; it’s a call to dismantle the systems of oppression that undermine all women in the workplace.\n\nIn the wake of the great DEI surge of 2020–2021 and the current collapse and retreat from creating more equitable workplaces, women of color—and particularly Black women—find themselves under attack, and in desperate need of support from true allies. To move forward, we must unmask the real villains and build a future grounded in solidarity, equity, and shared power.\n\nFrom the book QUALIFIED: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work by Shari Dunn.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to eliminate its scientific research office and could fire more than 1,000 scientists and other employees who help provide the scientific foundation for rules safeguarding human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants. As many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists — 75% of the research program's staff — could be laid off, according to documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe planned layoffs, cast by the Trump administration as part of a broader push to shrink the size of the federal government and make it more efficient, were assailed by critics as a massive dismantling of the EPA's longstanding mission to protect public health and the environment. The plans were first reported by The New York Times. Read more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he wants to eliminate 65% of the agency’s budget, a huge spending cut that would require major staffing reductions for jobs such as monitoring air and water quality, responding to natural disasters and lead abatement, among many other agency functions. The EPA has also issued guidance directing that spending items greater than $50,000 require approval from billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The Office of Research and Development — EPA's main science arm — currently has 1,540 positions, excluding special government employees and public health officers, according to the memo. A majority of staff — ranging from 50% to 75% — \"will not be retained,'' the memo said.\n\nThe plan calls for dissolving the research office and reassigning remaining staff to other parts of the agency “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities,\" the memo says. EPA officials have presented the plan to the White House for review. Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency “is taking exciting steps as we enter the next phase of organizational improvements,” but said changes had not been finalized. “We are committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water and land for all Americans,” she said, adding, “While no decisions have been made yet, we are actively listening to employees at all levels to gather ideas on how to increase efficiency and ensure the EPA is as up to date and effective as ever.” California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the science committee, said in a statement that the agency's research office was created by Congress and “eliminating it is illegal.”\n\nRead more: What Legal Experts Say About Trump’s Sweeping EPA Deregulation\n\nEvery decision the EPA makes “must be in furtherance of protecting human health and the environment, and that just can’t happen if you gut EPA science,” Lofgren said.\n\n“EPA cannot meet its legal obligation to use the best available science without (the Office of Research and Development) and that’s the point,'' she added. President Donald Trump and his adviser, Musk , “are putting their polluter buddies’ bottom lines over the health and safety of Americans,” Lofgren said.\n\nIn his first term, “Trump and his cronies politicized and distorted science,'' she said. “Now, this is their attempt to kill it for good.\"\n\nTicora Jones, chief science officer at the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump's EPA “yet again is putting polluters over people.\"\n\nShe called on Congress to “stand up and demand that EPA keep its scientists on the beat so that we all can get the clean air and clean water we need and deserve.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The second season of Severance answered many of viewers’ most burning questions: We now know what Mark S. has been doing with those numbers in Macrodata Refinement for the past two years, and what was inside that 25th severed room that awaited Gemma, Cold Harbor. We know what the goats are used for, lived to see Dylan G.’s innie once more, and got more meme-able Milchick dance moves. But Season 2’s finale still ended on a cliffhanger—with Mark’s innie choosing Helly R. over escaping the Lumon offices with Gemma—leaving us with many pressing questions for the show’s next season.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s what we’ll be thinking about between now and whenever Season 3 arrives. Is getting out that door enough for Gemma to escape? Will Season 3 be about Gemma trying to save Mark now that she’s out and he’s still inside? It’s hard to imagine that Lumon doesn’t have some security outside the severed floor given the sensitivity of their unethical experiments. But it would really stymie the momentum of this show if we find Gemma captured again at the beginning of Season 3. Gemma would surely try to contact outie Mark as soon as he leaves the Lumon building, at which point he would have little incentive to go back inside the office of the company that faked his wife’s death and tortured her. So I think the question becomes: Will innie Mark ever leave the severed floor, knowing that his outie would likely never return, or will he try to camp out there with Helly? Can Lumon somehow use the conflict between innie Mark and outie Mark to their advantage? Will Lumon deploy every acolyte it has to track down Gemma in the outside world before she runs to the closest TV news station?—Eliana Dockterman\n\nWas Lumon planning to just kill Gemma after Cold Harbor?\n\nDichen Lachman as Gemma in Episode 7 of Severance Season 2. Apple TV+\n\nIn addition to Ms. Cobel directly stating that innie Mark completing Cold Harbor would result in Gemma’s death, Mr. Drummond revealed prior to his own demise in the finale that the goat brought over by the Mammalians Nurturable department was intended to be sacrificed and entombed with Gemma in order to guide her spirit \"to Kier's door.\" The goats seem to play a role in Lumon’s cultish roots. But that still doesn’t explain why Lumon would want to just kill Gemma off if she was the key to their biggest scientific advancement to date. Perhaps she was simply being used as a test subject in an attempt to to prove the Cold Harbor process could work and was otherwise considered a liability given how much she knew about Lumon’s inner workings.—M.M.\n\nWhat does Lumon plan to do now that it has possibly perfected the severance process?\n\nIs Gemma fully severed? Apple TV+\n\nIt’s not clear to me that Lumon has perfected the severance process. A severed Gemma deciding to follow a complete stranger covered in blood out of a room because he claims he is her husband would suggest she is experiencing some deep, unaltered sense of trust in that man. If she can recognize Mark on a subconscious level, Gemma is not truly severed. Lumon’s ultimate goal seems to be allowing customers to sever themselves many, many times so that outies can spare themselves any unpleasant experience in their life—going to the dentist, flying on a turbulent airplane, giving birth, etc.—as well as the profoundly upsetting moments in a person’s psyche—taking apart the crib of the child you were never able to bring into the world. There are an infinite number of terrifying applications for this technology.\n\nFrom a pure plot perspective, the show would be over if Lumon achieved its goal. They would have no reason to keep innie Mark or innie Helly alive, let alone all the other innies associated with Cold Harbor. But it isn’t Severance without severed characters. Lumon will probably need to allow innie Mark to continue to exist to complete its failed mission.—E.D. Will Mark And Helly’s innies be terminated?\n\nMark S. and Helly R. now have something (or someone) to live for Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nAt this point, Mark and Helly seem like far more trouble than they are worth. Unless Mark must do more work on the Cold Harbor project—though it would appear his contribution is complete—the most logical next step for Lumon would be to drag Mark off the severed floor and banish him forever. They may well try to kill him because he knows too much, though Mark has enough connections in the outside world—his wife, his sister, every person who attended Ricken’s book party—that outright disposing of him would raise alarms.—E.D.\n\nWhat’s the deal with reintegration?\n\nReghabi, who was working to reintegrate Mark's brain, disappeared a few episodes before the finale Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nIt was an exciting moment this season when outie Mark made the decision to start reintegrating way back in Episode 3. But, seven episodes later, it doesn’t really seem like the process has progressed all that much. Innie and outie Mark are still clearly two completely different people with different hopes, fears, and goals. So was Reghabi doing it wrong? Or does reintegration just take a really long time? We want to know how the procedure actually works. And also how Mark has been running around the past few episodes with a giant hole in his head.—M.M.\n\nHow will reintegration impact the Mark-Gemma-Mark-Helly love quadrangle? If innie Mark’s choice to stay with Helly rather than run away with Gemma in the finale assured the audience that Mark is, in fact, two people, then reintegration is going to wreak havoc on Mark’s love life. As his brain becomes whole again and memories from each half of his bifurcated life return, will he become one man in love with two women? Or will his memories of a full life with Gemma overwhelm his relatively brief, if intense, experience with Helly?—E.D. What does Jame want with Helly?\n\nJame and Helena at their rather formal family breakfast table Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nBefore all the Cold Harbor madness got underway, we got a little more insight into Lumon CEO Jame Eagan’s perturbing relationship with his daughter Helena—and by extension, her innie Helly. While paying Helly a visit on the severed floor, Jame revealed that he not only doesn’t love Helena, but he also no longer “sees Kier” in her. However, he apparently does see Kier in Helly. Does that mean he’s going to try to turn Helly into the main version of Helena? Is Helena going to be subjected to what’s been done to Gemma for that to happen? Or is Lumon going to try to manipulate Helly into doing what they want by other means? If we know anything about Helly, it’s that she’s not one to be easily pushed around—unless, perhaps, she’s called to do something to protect the man she loves.—M.M.\n\nWhat is Ms. Cobel’s endgame?\n\nHas Harmony Cobel had a complete change of heart? Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nDespite getting a bunch of new information about Harmony Cobel’s traumatic upbringing in Episode 8, we still don’t really know what she ultimately wants to happen. We know she was the one who really invented the severance procedure and, at this point in time, seems to have turned against Lumon. In her own way, she also seems to genuinely care about Mark. But if her life’s work has been severance, where does she go from here?—M.M. What was going on with Milchick in the bathroom...and this whole season, for that matter?\n\nMilchick contemplates his loyalty to Lumon Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nTramell Tillman was the breakout actor of Season 1, and I got the impression the creators didn’t really know what to do with his character in Season 2 besides wrapping him up in Lumon red tape. He had a few interesting moments, like when he was given the racist paintings and when he tried to establish a mutual understanding with Natalie about the bizarre gift. (Also that time he told Mr. Drummond to “eat sh-t.”) But otherwise he’s largely left to chase, and never quite catch, Mark. There’s clearly a lot of tension between Mr. Milchick and the Eagans, as demonstrated in the final episode by his decision to spar with an animatronic Kier. But what are we supposed to take away from his moment in the bathroom—did he decide to double down on the Lumon cult, using this unmatched opportunity to prove his loyalty? Is he doubting his position? I couldn’t figure it out.—E.D. How do Devon and Ricken fit into all this?\n\nDevon and Ricken, a marriage made in...we're not sure where Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nThere are a lot of theories out there about Devon potentially being evil—seems unlikely—and Ricken potentially being connected to the Lumon goats—somehow, seems less unlikely. But this episode certainly didn’t give us much on either of those fronts. Judging by the finale, Devon just appears to be a concerned, if somewhat naive, sister who’s trying to look out for Mark. Ricken, on the other hand, is still in the process of writing a book that will function, for all intents and purposes, as straight Lumon propaganda. If anything, Devon and Ricken seem like they’ll probably need to catch each other up on what’s been happening and get on the same page at some point if they want their marriage to remain functional.—M.M.\n\nWhat happened to all the goat people to make them that way?\n\nThe goats and their mysterious people Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nWhy, in the name of Kier, would Lumon program these innies to care so deeply about baby goats that they would inevitably be required to sacrifice? Doesn’t that seem like an obvious way to breed resentment and, ahem, rebellion? Especially when you then hand one of those resentful people a gun? Lumon is making a lot of risky choices here. But, yes, we would love more information on what the heck is going on with these feral goat herders.—E.D. Will we ever see Ms. Huang again?\n\nMiss Huang awaits the next step of her Lumon journey Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nOne of the stranger—and more disturbing—revelations of this season was the fact that a child was working on the severed floor of Lumon. Who was she? Why was she there? Who are her parents? We still don’t know! Obviously, the writers were taking aim at issues like child labor and unpaid internships for young folks, but in a very literal sense, Miss Huang seemed like a distraction for Reddit theorizers rather than a real character. Perhaps she was just there to help viewers empathize with Miss Cobel, whose backstory as a child indoctrinated in the ways of Kier is not dissimilar to Miss Huang’s. Practically speaking, given how long of a gap there was between Season 1 and Season 2, it’s hard to imagine we’ll see Miss Huang in Season 3 unless there is a major time jump. She’ll simply age too much.—E.D. What’s going to happen to Dylan?\n\nDylan G.'s innie puts the moves on Gretchen Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nAlthough outie Dylan wasn’t too happy about the whole getting cheated on by his wife with his innie situation, in his response to innie Dylan’s resignation request, he was begrudgingly able to admit that he respected his innie’s confidence and initiative. Innie Dylan then proceeded to quickly prove he was in fact a “self-assured badass” by jumping into the fray with Helly to keep Mr. Milchick locked in the bathroom while Mark went on his rescue mission. The last we saw of Dylan in the finale was him joining forces with the Choreography and Merriment department in what looked like it was about to be a full-on revolt against Milchick’s tenure of the severed floor. Innie Dylan seems locked back in to helping his MDR pals by any means necessary. But we have to imagine Lumon won’t be too keen on keeping any employees around who helped incite a rebellion.—M.M. Will Irving come back?\n\nIrving and Burt's farewell Courtesy of Apple TV+\n\nWe didn’t see or hear any more about Irving this week after he boarded a train heading out of Kier at Burt’s insistence in Episode 9. But does that mean he’s gone for good? Personally, we’re still somehow hoping for all of our favorite MDR innies to be reunited at some point. And to find out what outie Irv’s whole deal was.—M.M.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "January’s unveiling of DeepSeek R1, China's most advanced AI model to date, signals a dangerous inflection point in the global AI race. As President Donald Trump warned in his recent address on technological security, this development represents nothing short of a \"wake-up call\" for American leadership. What's at stake isn't merely economic competitiveness but perhaps the most geopolitically precarious technology since the atomic bomb In the nuclear age that followed Oppenheimer's creation of the atomic bomb, America's technological monopoly lasted roughly four years before Soviet scientists achieved parity. This balance of terror, combined with the unprecedented destructive potential of these new weapons, gave rise to mutual assured destruction (MAD)—a deterrence framework that, despite its flaws, prevented catastrophic conflict for decades. The stakes of nuclear retaliation discourage each side from striking first, ultimately allowing for a tense but stable standoff\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday's AI competition has the potential to be even more complex than the nuclear era that preceded it, in part because AI is a broadly applicable technology that touches nearly every domain, from medicine to finance to defense. Powerful AI may even automate AI research itself, giving the first nation to possess it an expanding lead in both defensive and offensive power. A nation on the cusp of wielding superintelligent AI, an AI vastly smarter than humans in virtually every domain, would amount to a national security emergency for its rivals, who might turn to threatening sabotage rather than cede power. If we are heading towards a world with superintelligence, we must be clear-eyed about the potential for geopolitical instability. We map out some of the geopolitical implications of powerful AI and propose a cohesive “Superintelligence Strategy” in a new paper released this week. Let us imagine how the U.S. might reasonably respond to rival states seeking an insurmountable AI advantage. Suppose Beijing established a lead over American AI labs and reached the cusp of recursively-improving superintelligence before us. Regardless of whether Beijing could maintain control over what it was building, U.S. national security would be deeply and existentially threatened. Rationally, the U.S. might resort to threatening sabotage in the form of cyberattacks against AI datacenters to prevent China from achieving its goal. We might similarly expect Xi Jinping—or Vladimir Putin, who has little chance of obtaining the technology first—to respond in a similar fashion if we approach recursively-improving superintelligence. They would not stand idly by if a U.S. monopoly on power was imminent.\n\nJust as the destabilizing pursuit of nuclear monopoly eventually gave way to the stability of MAD during the nuclear era, we may soon enter a parallel deterrence dynamic for AI. If any state that attempts to seize AI supremacy can expect the threat of preemptive sabotage, states may be deterred from pursuing unilateral power altogether. We call this outcome Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM). As nations wake up to this possibility, we expect it will become the default regime, and we need to prepare now for this new strategic reality. MAIM is a deterrence framework designed to maintain strategic advantage, prevent escalation, and restrict the ambitions of rivals and malicious actors. For this to work, the U.S. must make clear that any rival destabilizing AI project, especially those aiming for superintelligence, will provoke retaliation. Here, offense—or at least the credible threat of offense—is likely the best defense. That means expanding our cyberattack capabilities and enhancing surveillance of adversary AI programs.\n\nWhile building this deterrence framework, America must simultaneously advance on two additional fronts: AI nonproliferation and domestic competitiveness.\n\nFor nonproliferation, we should enact stronger AI chip export controls and monitoring to stop compute power getting into the hands of dangerous people. We should treat AI chips more like uranium, keeping tight records of product movements, building in limitations on what high-end AI chips are authorized to do, and granting federal agencies the authority to track and shut down illicit distribution routes.\n\nFinally, to maintain a competitive edge, the U.S. should focus on building resilience in its supply chains for military tech and computing power. In particular, our reliance on Taiwan for AI chips is a glaring vulnerability and a critical chokepoint. While the West has a decisive AI chip advantage, Chinese competition could disrupt that. The U.S. should therefore step up its domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Superintelligent AI poses a challenge as elusive as any that policymakers have faced. It is what theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber called a “wicked problem,” one that continually evolves with no final formula for resolution. MAIM, supplemented by robust nonproliferation and renewed investment in American industry, offers a strategy grounded in the lessons of past arms races. There is no purely technical fix that can tame these forces, but the right alignment of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness measures can help the United States navigate the emerging geopolitical reality of superintelligence.",

I was there to document their arrival.\n\nFor more than a year, I have been embedded throughout El Salvador’s society, working on a book chronicling the country’s transformation. From the huts of remote island fishermen to the desk of the President, from elite homicide detective units to elementary school classrooms, I have interviewed government officials and everyday people, collecting stories that would shock Stephen King. I’ve stood in classrooms full of happy students which not long ago were empty, because children here once learned early that schools were places to be raped or recruited. I’ve interviewed killers in prison and sat with them face-to-face.",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. — A bill that would create a “turquoise” safety alert system for missing Native American people in New Mexico has been endorsed by the Legislature. A vote of the state Senate without opposition Thursday sent the rapid response initiative to New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who supports the proposal. The bill responds to a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country — and would allow law enforcement to quickly share information about Native Americans who go missing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — would function much like existing “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly. Cellphone alerts would be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American. “I carry with me countless stories of how our system has failed to respond to the disappearance or murder of Native people in our state,” said Democratic state Sen. Angel Charley of Acoma Pueblo, a co-sponsor of the bill. “We have answered the call.” California, Washington and Colorado have similar alert systems, according to the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs. Arizona lawmakers are considering their own alert system as the brutal death of San Carlos Apache teenager Emily Pike reverberates through Native American communities. New Mexico has 23 federally recognized tribes, including large portions of the Navajo Nation, as well as land holdings of the Fort Sill Apache.\n\nThe safety and concerns of those communities were on prominent display during a 60-day legislative session that ends Saturday at noon.\n\nA bill signed Wednesday by Lujan Grisham ensures students can wear their own Native American regalia at graduation and other school ceremonies in the spirit of free expression linked to cultural heritage.",

        "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "content": "An invasion by a neighbor with territorial ambitions. A wanton disregard of international law. A potential deal with Trump over critical minerals. No, this is not Ukraine—we are describing the tragic events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2021, Rwanda backed a rebellion in the Congo, the fifth time it has done so in the past 30 years. In January, the conflict sharply escalated, as Rwandan troops and their M23 rebel allies took control of Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo. The two border cities are home to 3 million people.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMuch like how Russia has justified the occupation of Donbas, Rwanda claims to be protecting an ethnic minority—in this case, the Tutsi community, which lives in both countries. And, as with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame, himself a Tutsi, claims his country has existential security concerns. Both reasons have been exaggerated by Rwanda. The crisis in the Congo has displaced 700,000 people since the beginning of the year and killed thousands. Humanitarian organizations are struggling to feed and give shelter to those in need now that USAID has cut much of the $800 million it provides to the Congo, which had amounted to 70% of the country’s entire aid budget. The crisis also threatens the stability of the government in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, as well as in Burundi, which has sent troops to help the Congo. If we don’t act, this crisis could engulf central Africa.\n\nIn contrast to Ukraine, the international community did little to address the crisis in the Congo until a month ago. For three years, the U.K. and the E.U. have actually increased aid to Rwanda despite its backing of the M23. The U.S. continued to remain Rwanda’s largest donor. The small, developing country home to 14 million people has figured out how to make itself useful, even indispensable to Western powers. It has sent troops to northern Mozambique, where a jihadist insurgency has threatened major French and Italian gas projects, and it has controversially offered to host asylum seekers from the U.K. and Denmark. And yet, the West has enormous leverage. While Rwanda has diversified its revenues—including by boosting its mineral exports to over $1 billion annually, most of which experts think comes from the Congo—it needs to maintain its reputation among foreign donors. In 2012, when Rwanda backed the same M23 rebels, the Obama Administration was critical in bringing a quick end to the crisis by cutting aid and sending a senior diplomat to help broker a peace deal. While the U.S. has cut aid and sanctioned senior Rwandan officials this time as well, there is much more it could do: impose visa bans, issue business and travel advisories, and pressure the World Bank to suspend development projects.\n\nThe private sector also has a role to play. Unwittingly, soccer teams PSG, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich are participating in sportswashing by promoting “Visit Rwanda” on their jerseys and in their stadiums. Celebrities have visited too over the past three years—among them Kevin Hart, Idris Elba, Ellen DeGeneres, and Danai Gurira—many taking pictures with President Kagame. More recently, two weeks after the M23 attack on Goma and Bukavu, John Legend performed in Kigali. (In response to the backlash that followed, he said: “I don’t believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders.”) Pressure on Rwanda could produce a short-term solution to the crisis in the Congo. Belgium, Rwanda’s former colonial ruler, cut ties on Monday with the country over its role in the Congo. The E.U. also announced sanctions the same day against Rwanda for its incursion in eastern Congo and plundering its mineral wealth.\n\nThe hope is that this and other pressure could first lead to a ceasefire, forcing Rwandan troops and the M23 to withdraw from eastern Congo, and then a deal with the M23 rebels that does not jeopardize Congolese sovereignty. Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi held direct talks in Qatar on Tuesday and called for an “immediate ceasefire” in eastern Congo, but it is unclear if M23 will heed the call after it backtracked from peace talks earlier this week. Yet this Congolese groundhog day—with a new Rwandan-backed rebellion appearing once every few years—requires a longer term solution. It is impossible to ignore the persistent crisis of governance in the Congo. A shambolic Congolese army of 130,000—supported by Burundians, local militias, and a regional force of South Africans, Malawians, and Tanzanians—was defeated by a joint Rwandan and M23 force of around 10,000 to 14,000. Opportunistic Congolese politicians and preachers have amplified hate speech against the Congolese Tutsi community, from which most M23 leaders come. In many ways, Kinshasa’s enemy is itself.\n\nCongolese leaders have a tendency for invective and to blame all their ills on Rwanda. But Congo’s leaders will also need to start looking inwards. The ongoing crackdown on the opposition and Tshisekedi’s bid to change the constitution to stay in power beyond term limits, has pushed some opponents into the arms of the M23 and Rwanda. The state’s neglect of the security services has also allowed corruption and confusion to fester in the army and police. In the long-term—and the holy grail of Congolese protest movements going back generations—the Congolese people must address the crippling crisis of corruption and misgovernance, in particular in the security forces.\n\nFinally, the main challenge will be to transform a conflict economy into one of peace. In the past, Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi lived together in peace. In the 1970s and 80s, for example, they formed a regional bank that invested in agriculture, as well as an electricity company. Even throughout this last bout of fighting, officials from all three countries have continued to staff a hydroelectric dam on their joint border. Today, billions of dollars in gold, tin, and tantalum are smuggled out to Congo’s neighbors every year. Here too, countries could collaborate on refining and tracing these minerals, turning minerals into an engine of growth instead of a conflict curse.",

        "title": "Rand Paul Trying to Rally GOP Opposition to Trump’s Tariffs",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Senate Republicans had gathered for one of their regular private lunches last Wednesday when Rand Paul commanded their attention. As Senators sipped diet sodas and grazed on sandwiches, the Kentucky lawmaker went through a slide deck with charts and statistics in service of a bold proposal: come out against President Trump’s tariffs. The arguments in Paul's presentation, which has not been previously reported, were not a surprise to his audience. One of the most prominent libertarians on Capitol Hill, he’s a fierce proponent of free trade. But his attempt to corral colleagues against the Trump trade agenda was seen as a provocation to the President’s close allies. “The public feels like free trade has sold us out,” Paul said, according to two Senators who were present, “but Americans are richer because of it.” Claiming that free trade agreements have spurred upward social mobility, one of his slides asserted that the middle class has shrunk in recent years only because more people had moved into the upper class.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Basically, he was saying that everyone was getting richer during Joe Biden’s presidency,” one Senator tells TIME. For some in the room, Paul’s rebellion reflected their deep unease over Trump’s protectionism, which has rattled stock markets, shaken consumer confidence, and strained America’s relationships with its allies. Economists now fear the U.S. is heading into a recession. But for many others, it was heresy. Tariffs are not only a Trumpian fixation, they were one of his core campaign pledges and a bedrock of his plan to reshore manufacturing jobs back to the United States. To that end, Paul was asking them to undermine the President, a political suicide mission given Trump's grip over the GOP base. Among Congressional Republicans, Paul has been more recalcitrant than most. He refused to endorse Trump in the 2024 election. He was the only GOP Senator to vote against the Trump-backed government funding bill last week. While tariffs are anathema to plenty of Republicans who preach the gospel of unfettered markets, Paul is one of the only members of Congress currently speaking out against them. “When the markets tumble like this, it pays to listen,” he recently wrote on social media. Behind the scenes, he’s been even more aggressive, courting members of Congress to join his renegade mission.\n\nThis makes Paul an anomaly. At a time when most elected Republicans are either America First true-believers or traditional conservatives who have bent the knee, Paul has emerged as a thorn in Trump’s side. “They have very different ideologies,” says Whit Ayres, a veteran GOP strategist. “Rand Paul is a libertarian and Donald Trump is a populist, and they have very different views about appropriate policies given those two different ideologies.” Paul isn’t the only Republican to push back on Trump. His fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell has voted against some of the President’s cabinet picks, such as Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. But it’s easier for McConnell than the rest; he’s retiring at the end of this term. Other GOP Senators who have dipped their toes in the opposition have eventually acquiesced under pressure. Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Thom Tillis each expressed reservations about Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary. But after an onslaught of social media harassment and abuse—combined with the threat of a Trump-endorsed, Elon Musk-funded primary challenger—they both voted to send Hegseth to the Pentagon.\n\nIn some ways, Paul has been less obstreperous than them. He voted to confirm nearly all of Trump’s cabinet nominees and rhetorically sought to smooth the waters last month. “A few people may have noticed that I resisted an enthusiastic endorsement of Donald Trump during the election,” Paul wrote on X. “But now, I’m amazed by the Trump cabinet (many of whom I would have picked). I love his message to the Ukrainian warmongers, and along with his DOGE initiative shows I was wrong to withhold my endorsement.” The detente didn’t last long. He has since become a vigorous antagonist of Trump’s stiff tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, which the President insists will galvanize an American industrial renaissance. Paul’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Paul have a history of acrimony. When they each sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Trump opened one of the first debates by ridiculing his rival. “Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage,” he said. “He’s got one percent in the polls and how he got up here—there’s far too many people up here anyway.” Paul dropped out five months later.\n\nThe two also have ideological disagreements. Paul is an intellectual disciple of the so-called Chicago School of Economics, most associated with Milton Friedman, which argues for laissez-faire economic policy. Trump, for his part, has ushered in a wave of national populism, with protectionist policies as a pillar of his economic agenda. He has called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” Tariffs may not be as beloved by all Republicans, but Trump has cobbled a right-wing coalition together by tethering his trade posture to a classic business-friendly program of cutting taxes and regulations. The mass movement he leads has also effectively captured the GOP, which operates in service to him. In the other Capitol chamber, House Republicans recently relinquished their own authority when it comes to trade, voting earlier this month to block their ability to challenge levies imposed by the President.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s trade war could hit Paul’s constituents hard. After Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, EU nations threatened last week to slap a 50% tariff on American whiskey, putting Kentucky bourbon in the crosshairs of a global trade war. (Trump struck back hours later by threatening a 200% tariff on European alcohol.)\n\nWhile Paul has little influence on the President, he does have a connection in the White House. One of Trump’s top policy advisers, Sergio Gor, used to be a spokesman in Paul’s Senate office. Sources close to Trump expect Gor to serve as an intermediary if Paul’s vote becomes crucial to securing an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. Paul, along with a handful of other Senators, have expressed doubts about adding to the national debt.\n\nPaul’s misgivings haven’t yet resulted in an impasse. But with Republicans holding a slim 53-seat Senate majority, that remains a future possibility. And if the tax bill creates a confrontation between the two, it may not be the last. By resisting parts of the Trump agenda, Paul may be setting himself on a collision course for 2028, when he’s up for reelection. “The thing about Trump,” says a senior GOP Senate aide. “He has a very long memory.”",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\n\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\n1 day ago Share Save John Zada Share Save\n\nJohn Zada (Credit: John Zada)\n\nUnalaska Island in the remote Aleutian archipelago was part of an epic, but now mostly forgotten, military campaign during World War Two.\n\nSituated where the northern Pacific Ocean meets the Bering Sea, the remote US island of Unalaska straddles the liminal zone where North America transitions into Siberia. The island lies further west than Hawaii; its position on the cusp of East Asia makes it one of Alaska's more remote and idiosyncratic communities.\n\nPart of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,100-mile volcanic archipelago that curves in a westward arc to within 600 miles of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, Unalaska features one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions. The windswept coastlines are rugged, often precipitous and almost entirely devoid of trees.\n\nBecause of the Aleutians' location in the Pacific Ring of Fire – one of the world's most seismically active areas – earthquakes are ubiquitous, and half of the island chain's 70 volcanoes, including Unalaska's active Makushin volcano, have erupted in the last 250 years. \"Cradle of Storms\" and \"Birthplace of Winds\" are two well-deserved nicknames among locals for the Aleutians. Conflicting weather systems generated in neighbouring seas result in cyclonic storms, hurricane-force winds, heavy rain and dense fog that have a considerable impact upon weather across much of Canada and the continental US.\n\nJohn Zada Unalaska's 4,200 residents live in one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions (Credit: John Zada)\n\nToday roughly 4,200 people call Unalaska home, including fishermen and the Indigenous Unangax̂ people (pronounced Oo-Nung-akhh). Also referred to as the Aleuts, the Unangax̂ have lived in the archipelago and parts of the Alaska Peninsula for at least 9,000 years, creating a subsistence lifestyle that drew upon every resource that the land and sea offered. But over the past several centuries, the Unangax̂ population has plummeted due to disease and the gradual attrition of their culture that came on the heels of colonialism. Today there are around 2,000 Unangax̂ in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\n\nRediscovering America Rediscovering America is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\nYet, this wind-battered island has historically been home to another very different group of peoples who also migrated across what is now the Bering Strait: Russians.\n\nAfter Danish explorer Vitus Bering and his Russian colleague Alexei Chirikov became the first-known Europeans to visit the Aleutian Islands in 1741, waves of Russian fur traders flocked to the archipelago to hunt sea otters and fur seals. After establishing a Russian settlement on Unalaska in 1759, the islands officially became a colony of the Russian Empire in the late 1700s. Today many inhabitants still have Russian surnames. The Russian Orthodox Church followed the fur hunters, building small houses of worship across the islands and converting many Unangax̂ to their faith.\n\nAlthough the US gained control of the Aleutian Islands when it purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the Russian Orthodox legacy has survived. Unalaska's Church of the Holy Ascension is one of a few Russian Orthodox houses of worship that remain. Rebuilt atop its original 1824 location in 1896, it is the oldest cruciform-style Russian Orthodox cathedral in North America, and contains one of Alaska's greatest collection of Russian artefacts, religious icons and artworks – including some that were donated directly from Catherine the Great.\n\nJohn Zada Reverend Evon Bereskin was previously Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest (Credit: John Zada)\n\nBefore the arrival of the current Russian Orthodox priest, reverend Evon Bereskin was Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest and the keeper of the Church of the Holy Ascension from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Unangax̂ community, he oversaw all the parishes in the Aleutian islands.\n\n\"I am constantly in awe of the fact that I [was] the custodian of this incredible relic building,\" he told me. \"It [was] an unbelievable honour and responsibility.\"\n\nAs head of the church, Reverend Bereskin raised funds to restore the church and its icons, which had suffered at the hands of time and the elements. He also changed the liturgy of his services to English (from the Unangax̂ language and old Slavonic) to make services more accessible to worshippers.\n\nPrior to World War Two, the US had a modest commercial and military presence on the Aleutian Islands, which, lying relatively close to East Asia, were vulnerable to attack after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. On 3-4 June 1942, planes from two Japanese aircraft carriers attacked Dutch Harbor in the town of Unalaska on the island's northern coast, killing 50 people. Several days later Japanese forces invaded Kiska and Attu islands, the westernmost islands in the Aleutians (670 and 850 miles from Unalaska, respectively), in an attempt to inflict a psychological blow and divert US forces from the Central Pacific theatre, where the Battle of Midway Island was about to take place. It was the first invasion of US soil since the British incursions in 1812. The SS Northwestern, a passenger and freight steamship used by the US Navy in the war, was destroyed in the Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor. Its rusted hull still rises above the water's surface, a ghostly reminder of a bloody battle.\n\nJohn Zada The SS Northwestern, a steamship destroyed in a WWII Japanese attack, still rises above the water's surface (Credit: John Zada)\n\nWithin months of the Dutch Harbor attack, 145,000 US and Canadian soldiers were deployed to defend and retake the occupied Aleutians. They secured the islands with fortresses, artillery and bunkers, such one on Bunker Hill above Dutch Harbor, which is now the setting of a hike with stunning 360-degree views. A larger base overlooking Unalaska Bay and the Bering Sea a few miles away on nearby Mount Ballyhoo, known as Fort Schwatka, once featured 100 buildings and was built to withstand earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. Epic, harrowing battles were fought on bleak and difficult terrain. Thousands died on both sides of the conflict – many from exposure to the islands' harsh weather. By August 1943, the Japanese were expelled from the Aleutians, and over time, the battles that took place here have been largely forgotten.\n\nAfter the Japanese attacks, the US military ordered the mandatory evacuation of the Unangax̂ from the Aleutians for their safety and to prepare the island for arriving military forces. Residents were given less than a day's notice, allowed one suitcase each and weren't told where they were going or when they would return. In all, 881 Unangax̂ were expelled from nine villages across the archipelago and were interned at abandoned canneries in the temperate rainforests of south-eastern Alaska for three years. Many had never left their homeland before, let alone seen trees.\n\nAround 10% of the camps' population perished due to poor housing and sanitation conditions and limited access to health care. Those who returned to Unalaska in 1945 found their villages either looted or burned down. In the 1980s, the Unangax̂ sued for ill-treatment and deprivation of their rights in conjunction with Japanese Americans who were also interned during the war. In 1988, a restitution law was passed granting financial compensation and an apology to the Unangax̂ from both Congress and the President. Today, an etched stone slab Unalaska serves as is a memorial to that dark period.\n\nAfter World War Two, Unalaska became a hub of the US' commercial fishing industry, which still dominates the island today. Dutch Harbor is the US' top commercial fishing port by volume and the main delivery port featured on Discovery Channel's hit reality show, Deadliest Catch. Four hundred vessels from 14 countries make port here each year, catching several hundred million pounds of fish – around 10% of the entire US fishing industry. Halibut, salmon, herring and several varieties of crab are among the species caught in nearby waters.\n\nJohn Zada Unalaska’s nutrient-rich waters are home to a staggering amount of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (Credit: John Zada)\n\nAlaskan pollock comprises 80% of all seafood processed on the island and is used to produce fish oil, fish fillets (for frozen fish sticks and McDonald’s Filet-o-Fish sandwiches) and surimi (imitation crab meat) among other products. UniSea, the largest seafood processing plant on the island, has some of the highest environmental standards of any fishery in Alaska, including traceable seafood and lowest by-catch.\n\n\"We use every part of the pollock fish here and nothing goes to waste,\" said Tom Enlow, president and CEO of UniSea and a resident of Unalaska. \"Fish oil gives us a renewable hydrocarbon to help power and heat our plant and worker accommodations, thereby offsetting the burning of diesel.\"\n\nIn addition to an abundance of fish, Unalaska's nutrient-rich waters play host to a rich variety of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (humpback, pilot and fin). Steller's sea lions gather on isolated rocks known as rookeries to mate and give birth between May and July. The Aleutian coastlines are also home to a nesting seabird population that is larger than that of the rest of the US combined. Bird enthusiasts travel from all over the world to see the varied waterfowl, especially the ultra-rare whiskered auklet.\n\nMeanwhile, hiking Unalaska's trails exposes the remote corners of the island. Traversing its rolling alpine meadows and dramatic mountains is to experience the palpable soul of the Aleutians. These poetic, lyrical landscapes soften the harsh and sometimes unforgiving attributes of a place deeply beholden to the elements.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\n\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands – the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom – venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\n\nThe SpeciaList Nienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\n\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\n\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower – enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\n\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n\nSerghei Starus / Alamy Stock Photo A stop at the iconic Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse is obligatory for any tulip lover visiting the Netherlands (Credit: Serghei Starus / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\n\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\nResponsible Flower Viewing Tourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\n\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year… right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\n\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/ Address: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse Contact: info@keukenhof.nl Instagram: @visitkeukenhof\n\nfamveld / Alamy Stock Photo The Bloemencorso parade of exquisitely decorated flower floats marches through the Bollenstreek, creating a vibrant Springtime atmosphere (Credit: famveld / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\n\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\n\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment… every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\n\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip Panis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere. And on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\n\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure… it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\n\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets … it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\n\nAFF/Alamy Stock Photo For the best – legal – immersive tulip experiences, visit a tulip farm like the Tulip Barn in Hillegom with its 750,000 tulips (Credit: AFF / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\n\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\n\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\n\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\n\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\n\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\n\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl Address: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands Phone: +31651368784 Instagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n\nfamveld / Alamy Stock Photo The Bloemencorso parade of exquisitely decorated flower floats marches through the Bollenstreek, creating a vibrant Springtime atmosphere (Credit: famveld / Alamy Stock Photo))\n\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\n\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\n\nTulip Road Trip Map When roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan – like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike. \"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\n\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl Address: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands Phone: +31653839979 Instagram: @pickinggardenholland\n\nNini Kraan / Alamy Stock Photo Head to the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen to see rare historic bulbs in living colour (Credit: Nini Kraan / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\n\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\n\nDid You Know? \"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\n\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\n\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/ Address: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands Phone: +31617291643 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'The melodramatic penis': How The White Lotus reveals the hidden codes of male nudity on screen\n\n1 day ago Share Save Laura Martin Share Save\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (Credit: Warner Bros Discovery)\n\nEpisode four of The White Lotus season three, which is set in Thailand, saw the increasingly agitated millionaire dad Tim Ratliff (Jason Isaacs) sit down for breakfast in a loosely tied dressing robe. His family are unaware that Tim is wanted by the FBI for illegal financial dealings and will likely end up in prison – and that he's been popping tablets of anti-anxiety medication Lorazepam like sweeties.\n\nWarning: This article contains language that some may find offensive\n\n\"Everyone at the club…!\" he mutters to himself in horror, and, imagining his acquaintances finding out about his crimes, he puts his hands up over his head, accidentally exposing his genitals as a result. \"Oh my god, Dad!\" his three near-adult children cry out in disgust. \"Your balls!\"\n\nIt might have been only a flash of male genitalia in this third series of Mike White's hugely successful dramedy about one-percenters on holiday, but it instantly became a much-discussed moment on social media. \"Jason Isaacs I was unfamiliar with ur game,\" one person posted on X, while another added: \"[the] full frontal made me spill my soup I wasn't ready.\" Others connected Isaacs' nakedness back to his other famous role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. \"Well, I didn't expect White Lotus to show Lucius Malfoy's wand tonight, but here we are…\" one user quipped.\n\nBut this was far from the first time the male anatomy was the focus in this series. In the first episode, Isaacs' on-screen son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) was shown flashing his penis and buttocks while announcing to his younger brother that he was going to masturbate to pornography in their shared bathroom; and the two prior series have also been replete with naked men.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery A flash of male genitalia in the third series of The White Lotus instantly became a much-discussed moment on social media (Credit: Warner Bros Discovery)\n\nIn fact, it's become a running theme: every opening episode from each three White Lotus series features a penis set loose. Hawaii-set series one had Steve Zahn's Mark Mossbacher ask his wife to inspect his testicles as he believed he had cancer. In the first episode of series two (set in Sicily) cocky finance bro Cameron (Theo James) goes to his friend's partner's hotel bedroom to borrow some swimming shorts, then changes in full view, giving her and the viewers a glimpse of his penis. \"What do you think? A little snug, right?\" he says of the shorts to Harper (Aubrey Plaza), once again directing the gaze downwards.\n\nBack to the current series, this week's episode saw one of resort-worker Valentin's Russian friends, Vlad, stripping off and waving his genitalia around on a night out, while elsewhere across all three series there have been other nude male characters, either masturbating or having sex, such as Adam DiMarco as Albie and Will Sharpe as Ethan (both series two); while both series one and two each had genuinely jaw-dropping, bombshell all-male sex scenes. Series one saw a drug-fuelled sex session (featuring Armond the hotel manager [Murray Bartlett] and younger White Lotus staff member, Dillon [Lukas Gage]), while season two's big reveal was with two men, Quentin (Tom Hollander) and Jack (Leo Woodall) having sex, who had claimed to be uncle and nephew, but were really client and sex worker.\n\nThere's no doubt that White uses male nudity and sex scenes to provoke. And it works: season three is averaging 12.2 million viewers per episode – up 78% from the same season two time frame – and it frequently trends on social media, going into overdrive when any male nakedness pops up. But the fact that these scenes still generate headlines from news outlets around the world shows that while male nakedness might be becoming a little more common, it's still seen as a taboo, and worthy of comment, which in itself, speaks volumes as to how comfortable (or uncomfortable) many feel about seeing naked men on screen.\n\n'The exception rather than the norm'\n\nEuropean film and TV has traditionally taken a more relaxed approach to showing full-frontal male and female nudity on screen. In the US and UK it's a very different story. Strict Ofcom guidelines in the UK have a \"watershed\" rule of no nudity permitted before 21:00 (BST). And while that may mean bare bottoms have occasionally appeared on TV in the late evenings, penises didn't really appear until the 1990s, with Eurotrash, a late-night magazine-style programme on Channel 4 that featured the exploits of the weird and wonderful people of Europe, and casually showed penises and vulvas; or the sexual adventures of the gay men in the groundbreaking Queer As Folk in 1999. But even now, seeing male genitalia on UK TV is still the exception, rather than the norm.\n\nThe audience reaction from scenes from The White Lotus proves the point that it's still not seen as 'normal'… Mike White is slightly exploiting in his decision to devote repeated screen time to it – Santiago Fouz-Hernandez\n\nIn the US, the first penis on TV is believed to be a split-second shot of a naked horse wrangler in 1989 miniseries Lonesome Dove, based on the Western novels by Larry McMurtry. But it was the advent of cable and broadcasters like HBO and Showtime that began to push the boundaries of the naked male body; in the 1992 HBO series Tales from the Crypt, one character jumps up after having sex, displaying his penis; then portrayals of the full naked male body continued in shows like Oz (from 1997) and Game of Thrones (from 2011), all the way through to a reported 30 penises shown in Euphoria's mens' locker room scene in 2019 or a talking penis on Hulu's Pam & Tommy in 2022.\n\n\"I would argue that the naked male form has become more normalised on screen over the past few years,\" says Santiago Fouz-Hernandez, a film studies professor in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures at Durham University, who specialises in gender, sexuality and the body on screen. \"But the audience reaction from scenes from The White Lotus proves the point that it's still not seen as 'normal', it's not something common and that's what Mike White is slightly exploiting in his decision to devote repeated screen time to it.\"\n\nBut if there has been a rise in male genitalia on screen, why has television shied away from it in the past? \"There's the idea of the 'phallic mystique',\" suggests Fouz-Hernandez, \"which [film studies professor] Peter Lehman wrote about in the early 90s and is a fascinating perspective. The penis and the phallus are two very different things. The phallus is not a polite way to refer to the penis, it's a concept, and symbolic; it's the idea of male power and the privilege that comes from having one. Lehman, among others, like Susan Hunt or Susan Bordo, have argued that patriarchy relies on keeping the penis out of sight, otherwise if it was visible or normalised, that idea of power could be debunked and men lose their power. The phallus is what being masculine and what being male is about.\"\n\nWarner Bros Discovery In series two, Cameron (Theo James) goes to Harper's (Aubrey Plaza) hotel room to borrow some swimming shorts, then changes in full view of her (Credit: Warner Bros Discovery)\n\nThis certainly tracks with the vulnerability of two of The White Lotus men, Mark and Tim. \"The penis is a very vulnerable organ in itself,\" Fouz-Hernandez explains – and perhaps, as older men going through some sort of trauma, they are past caring about upholding the notion of the powerful phallus. Whether accidentally or on purpose, they're exposing themselves fully to others. Faced with bigger problems, their need to uphold their status takes a back seat.\n\nThe opposite seems to be true for the hyper-masculine characters of Cameron and Saxon, who actively parade their penises to others, whether they want to see them or not. They position themselves as being such alpha males, so well-endowed and overly confident with themselves that they don't need to bother to keep up the pretence of keeping the phallus covered. \"What have I got to hide?\" they seem to insinuate. But there's also a predatory, threatening note to these two men displaying their penises to assert sexual authority; the recipients of these full-frontal shows are a woman who Cameron has only just met, and finds herself alone with him in a hotel bedroom; and Saxon's younger and physically smaller brother, who is also in a vulnerable position as Saxon bullies him and mocks him for being a virgin, telling him repeatedly about his aim to get him \"laid\" this holiday. As Evan Romano wrote in Men's Health in 2022 about Cameron, they are \"weaponising male nudity\".\n\nAll these on-screen genital reveals are set up to be a moment of \"shock\", something that Peter Lehman identified as a common trope when it comes to full-frontal male nudity in films, says Fouz-Hernandez. \"They established the concept called 'the melodramatic penis', where when there's a full-frontal moment on screen, it's not simply just casual or 'normal' at all, as it's usually accompanied by a shock, or drama around it. There's a dualism of having it on the screen. It's normalised; but it's also not, as there's drama connected to it. This is true for the reveals in The White Lotus: when we see the genitals, it's accompanied with a case of potential cancer [in one instance], while another character fears his life is about to be exposed, and in another there appears to be a love triangle unfolding.\"\n\nA 'double standard'?\n\nEach case of nudity in The White Lotus helps move on-screen representations on from the male gaze, which traditionally used the camera to look voyeuristically at the female body. David Opie wrote in Digital Spy that many nude male scenes in The White Lotus were \"important\" as they \"exist to deconstruct masculinity in relation to sex, status, and misogyny, while flipping the script in a world where women are still objectified more than men\". Meanwhile, Isaacs told Decider that he thinks White is \"trying to right the balance of how many naked women I've seen growing up on every television show and film. Nudity is the thing,\" he added. \"He uses it sometimes for comedy, sometimes for sex, sometimes for manipulation. It's a good TV moment.\"\n\nWarner Bros Discovery Hawaii-set series one had Steve Zahn's Mark Mossbacher ask his wife to inspect his testicles as he believed he had cancer (Credit: Warner Bros Discovery)\n\nLet's not forget White's use of nudity for comic effect: in episode five of The White Lotus season three, Vlad helicopters his penis by the pool in a way that's highly unlikely to signify anything else other than capturing a silly, drunken moment. Part of the show's appeal, says Henry Wong, senior culture editor at Esquire, is White's ability to jump from the funny to the serious in these exposing scenes: \"Any redressing of the balance between male and female nudity feels like a playful side effect rather than a primary goal to me. Maybe the nudity is supposed to be threatening – I am sure that many viewers can imagine themselves in similar, sinister situations – or sexy or funny, or all of those things at the same time. White isn't too definitive about it, and that's for the better.\"\n\nHowever, Wong notes: \"I do think it's interesting how the male actors often have to mention that it's a prosthetic on press cycles. Does that show a lingering discomfort or awkwardness around male nudity and specifically penises?\"\n\nIndeed, each time a White Lotus actor does a nude scene, they're asked about it. \"I didn't even have to do that part,\" Zahn told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's somebody else wearing a prosthetic. That's about as absurd as it gets, right?\". Theo James also used a prosthetic, telling Variety that he asked the make-up artist: \"I just wanted it not to be distracting. It needs to be 'Regular Joe'. Because the scene, you know, it's not about the pee pee, it's about power play and sex… She says, 'I got you. Yeah, I got you. Regular Joe.'\" However, when he saw it, he added: \"It's like she stole it off a donkey in the field! The thing is ginormous.\" Isaacs' on-screen children, Sarah Catherine Hook and Sam Nivola, both confirmed to TV Insider that the scene they shot with Isaac was filmed using a prosthetic in place.\n\nHowever, in an interview with CBS Mornings, Isaacs took umbrage at the questions around nudity. \"I think it's interesting that there's a double standard for men, but when women are naked, Margaret Qualley in The Substance, no one would dream of talking to her about her genitalia or her nipples or any of those things. So, it's odd that there's a double standard…\n\n\"I genuinely think it would be odd when there are characters – and some of the women are naked in here – it'd be odd if you were sitting here. And you would never dream of discussing their genitalia, not for a second.\" As he continued to be asked questions on the subject, Isaacs added: \"What is your obsession? Mike White is a brilliant writer, it's the best series on television for a long time. And what is the obsession with penises? It's an odd thing.\"\n\nA few days later, Isaacs clarified his comments, telling Variety: \"I said the wrong words in the wrong way. I used the phrase 'double standard,' which I didn’t mean at all. There is a [different] double standard – women have been monstrously exploited and men haven't.\" But he added: \"I had been asked so many times in the same day by journalists, 'Are you wearing a prosthetic?' Which means, 'Have I seen your actual penis? It's very important for me to know if I've seen your penis.' It just strikes me as a bit weird and slightly obsessive. I thought I could have fun batting it off, but I batted it off very poorly.\"\n\nThere are further issues with using fake genitals on screen, says Fouz-Hernandez. \"On one hand, it's great that Mike White is giving visibility and normalising male nudity,\" he says. \"And I understand the idea of contracts and that actors might not want to show their real genitals for close-ups, but the use of prosthetics and digital effects is disappointing, because in a way, they defeat the purpose by contributing to perpetuating the very phallic imagery that male frontal nudity could debunk, creating an unrealistic representation. It would be good to see more realistic diversity of sizes and shapes... The series is therefore perpetuating the phallic mystique by revealing a penis that isn't even real, which is problematic.\"\n\nWith two more episodes of the current season still to air, it's likely that there are a few more shocks in store for the guests at The White Lotus resort in Koh Samui. Of the sex acts – and presumably the depiction of the naked male form too – in The White Lotus, White told The New Yorker that he likes to portray them as transgressive, not to condemn them, but to connect them back to the idea of where we all evolved from: \"It's not all harmless. But it's not inherently harmful. It's inherently very natural. We're animals.\"\n\nThe White Lotus is available to stream on HBO in the US or Sky Atlantic/NOW in the UK\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Clare McHugh Share Save\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nWith her award-winning Wolf Hall series of books, novelist Hilary Mantel made sympathetic a figure long considered a historical bad guy. But did she also 'sidestep crucial matters'?\n\nNearly 500 years after his death, Thomas Cromwell lives again, reborn in the popular imagination thanks to novelist Hilary Mantel, and her Wolf Hall trilogy. For decades, historians piled layer after layer of interpretation upon Henry VIII's astute chief minister, a key figure in the Reformation, when King Henry broke from the Catholic Church to establish his own Church of England. But now, with the emergence of Mantel's fictional Cromwell – so attractive, so splendidly presented – the real man is in danger of being buried forever.\n\nGoing forward, Cromwell's name will likely call to mind the lean, canny look of actor Mark Rylance – star of the television adaptations of the Wolf Hall series – rather than the grumpy, heavy-jowled visage captured by artist Hans Holbein in a portrait done from life circa 1534. And a figure once counted among history's villains will retain the glow of Mantel's revisionist high regard for many years to come.\n\nNational Portrait Gallery The famous Hans Holbein portrait of Cromwell portrays him as a grumpy individual (Credit: National Portrait Gallery)\n\nStarting on 23 March, US audiences can watch Rylance play Cromwell, alongside Damian Lewis as King Henry, one more time. Six hours of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, based on the third and final book, make up the last tranche of episodes of the BBC's lavish costume drama. The script takes the complicated story of Cromwell's fall, culminating in his execution for treason in 1540 after six years as the King's right-hand man, and renders it (relatively) easy to follow. Especially impressive is the dialogue, often lifted directly from Mantel's text. The author, who died of a stroke in 2022, had a gift for rendering 16th-Century speech in a non-risible way. (The Wolf Hall novels have also been adapted into two plays.)\n\nAlthough critics consider The Mirror and the Light to be the least successful of the novels – it's the only one of the three not to win the Booker Prize – the TV version received rapturous reviews when broadcast in the UK last autumn. The Guardian's five-star review proclaimed: \"The final instalment of Hilary Mantel's masterpiece is the most intricate television you are ever likely to see. It is so beautifully made it's breathtaking.\"\n\nFact v fiction\n\nBut where do sumptuous production values end, and the facts begin? Such questions have accompanied Mantel's project from the start. Tracy Borman, Chief Historian at Historic Royal Palaces and author of 2015's Thomas Cromwell: The Untold Story of Henry VIII's Most Faithful Servant, tells the BBC about the impact Mantel's first Tudor novel, Wolf Hall, had on her upon its publication in 2008. \"All through my education, from early school days until university, I was taught that Henry VIII's chief minister was a grasping, ruthless, cynical henchman, driven by greed and power. Then I read Wolf Hall and it gave such a different perspective… I was inspired to write a non-fiction biography so that I could find out where the truth lay.\"\n\nResearching her book, Borman discovered a sharp-witted and enterprising Cromwell, as Mantel did, and realised just how thorough the novelist had been in mining primary sources for innumerable details, including Tudor swear words, Cromwell's favourite wines, and the names of his servants. \"Granted, she took artistic license when she needed to,\" Borman says. \"Notably in downplaying Cromwell's role in Anne Boleyn's execution, and in making him something of a heartthrob at court.\"\n\nSamantha Rogers, who teaches early modern history at Vanderbilt University, agrees. \"There are a great many popular novels about the Tudors I can't bear to read,\" she tells the BBC. \"Mantel's work is the gold standard – well-researched and rooted in history. However, to paint a largely sympathetic portrait of Cromwell, she does sidestep some crucial matters.\"\n\nBBC/ Playground Entertainment Mark Rylance plays Cromwell in the BBC TV adaptations of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall novels (Credit: BBC/ Playground Entertainment)\n\nRogers notes that when King Henry wanted to rid himself of his second wife, Anne Boleyn, the court musician Mark Smeaton, under torture, implicated her in serious crimes – adultery with five men including her own brother. Cromwell most certainly supervised his torture, and yet in the taut and chilling Bring Up the Bodies, the second of Mantel's Tudor novels, Smeaton is merely threatened, put in a dark closet, and never physically assaulted.\n\nLiterary critic and biographer Megan Marshall, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Margaret Fuller: A New American Life, explains to the BBC how, in writing about a historical figure, both a biographer and novelist \"will pluck out what concerns us, and what concerns the audience… although the novelist likely has a more conscious agenda than a biographer\".\n\nMantel's view of Cromwell is inevitably coloured by her personal perspective. She made no secret of her rejection, during adolescence, of the Catholic faith she was brought up in, nor her scorn for the representation of Cromwell and his staunchly Catholic nemesis Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's play A Man for All Seasons, which, as a film, won the Oscar for best picture in 1967. In Bolt's telling, Cromwell is the big baddie, both ruthless and underhanded in his methods. More, Lord High Chancellor of England, and later venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, is the hero, executed for refusing to swear an oath recognising the monarch as the supreme head of the Church in England. More's eloquent resistance, and faithfulness to the dictates of his own conscience, resonated amid the counter-culture of the 1960s.\n\nMost of Henry VIII's court were blue-blooded nobles, then in comes Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith from a seedy part of London, and he takes it by storm. It's a story as dramatic as it is seductive – Tracy Borman\n\nEamon Duffy, emeritus professor of history at the University of Cambridge, has accused Mantel of going too far with her demythologising of More. He says that she made More into a monster, \"a torturer and a misogynist whose wife and womenfolk were afraid of him,\" he said in a recent interview with the Idler magazine, adding, \"I think that [More] portrayal was the least successful bit of Wolf Hall.\"\n\nA hero for our times\n\nYet as she drags More down, Mantel is simultaneously rehabilitating Cromwell. And in the process, does she not give readers a Cromwell that fits the 21st Century? A hero for our time? Rogers believes that she does, pointing out that writer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, with his hit musical Hamilton, recast Founding Father Alexander Hamilton in a similar way. \"Both are appealing, scrappy guys who come from nothing,\" says Rogers. Appealing, in other words, to audiences preoccupied by the structural barriers – be they based on class, race, wealth or gender – that prevent people today from flourishing.\n\nAlamy The 1966 film Man for All Seasons depicted Thomas More (played by Paul Scofield, pictured right) as a hero and Cromwell as a villain (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBorman concurs. \"Henry VIII's court was far from being a meritocracy: most of its members were blue-blooded nobles and the top positions were practically hereditary. Then in comes Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith from a seedy part of London, and he takes the court – and its king – by storm. It's a story as dramatic as it is seductive.\"\n\nWhat Wolf Hall leaves out, however, is of particular interest to the leading Cromwell scholar working today. Diarmaid MacCulloch, emeritus professor of history at the University of Oxford, and author of 2018's Thomas Cromwell: A Life, argues that rather than Cromwell pursuing the country's religious change for political ends, he was a sincere Protestant, determined throughout his years in the King's service to bring church reform to England. And while MacCulloch greatly admires Mantel's novels, in a 2018 interview with the podcast History Extra, he said that \"the one thing she played down… is the religion\". He added: \"Perhaps for a modern novel-reading audience, you simply can't do it.\"\n\nHistorical fiction may indeed reveal as much about the time it is written in, as the time it is written about. Mantel referred to this duality in her Reith Lectures on the craft, presented for the BBC in 2017, along with the many challenges of weaving fiction out of fact. \"The pursuit of the past makes you aware, whether you are novelist or historian, of your own fallibility and inbuilt bias,\" she declared. It's in the gaps in the official record that a writer of fiction can do her most valuable work, she said.\n\nThat audiences – readers, theatregoers, TV viewers – all find Mantel's Cromwell so compelling testifies not only to her skill at filling in gaps, but to her love for the protagonist – the witty, affectionate, energetic, all-seeing polymath – she contrived after emerging from the archives. \"When I sat down to write at last,\" Mantel recalled in a 2012 essay, \"it was with relish for his company.\"\n\nThe Mirror and the Light premieres on 23 March on PBS Masterpiece in the US and is available now to stream on BBC iPlayer in the UK\n\n--",

Here's how to minimise your impact\n\n3 days ago Share Save Thea de Gallier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.\n\nI first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores – red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.\n\nI'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.\n\nAccording to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area – a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole – increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land – an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.\n\nAlamy The polar regions are threatened – and travellers can make careful choices to lessen their impact (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.\n\nJames Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels – or more specifically, their vomit.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nSnow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. \"We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,\" Grecian explains. \"For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.\"\n\nAs a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments – and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.\n\nJames Grecian Marine ecologist James Grecian has spent years studying polar wildlife (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nPlanes, trains or cruise ships?\n\nFirst of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.\n\nThe problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,\" he says. \"I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes – if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.\"\n\nWhile ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue – the hum of ships' engines has been shown to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.\n\n\"There's a horrible video – an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,\" says Grecian. \"It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.\"\n\nSo what's the alternative?\n\n\"Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option.\" It is possible – but takes much longer – to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to Bodø in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.\n\nAlamy Many travellers don't realise that there is train access to some parts of the Arctic (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOr you could – if you have the money – charter a small sailing boat. \"I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,\" says Grecian. \"The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.\"\n\nThink before you selfie\n\nPolar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.\n\n\"You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,\" says Grecian. \"There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.\"\n\nGrecian recommends patience. \"If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.\"\n\nLocal guides can also provide essential knowledge – plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. \"Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.\"\n\nJames Grecian Polar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but travellers should be respectful and give animals space (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nConsider eating seal\n\nThat might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint – globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\nIn Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities still subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. \"The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,\" says Grecian. \"The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.\"\n\nOf course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option – a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.\n\nThink outside the box when packing\n\nFor the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear – and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.\n\n\"If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,\" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.\"\n\nAlamy Plan your trip for May or June to see icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. \"Nasal spray,\" he says. \"Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed.\" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun – Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: \"On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!\"\n\nSync up with nature\n\nGrecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October – the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.\n\n\"If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,\" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. \"For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.\"\n\nHis advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine\n\n7 March 2025 Share Save Tristan Rutherford Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\n\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Buddha's Hand is named for its resemblance to the fingers shown on many Buddha representations (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\n\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\n\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\n\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The UN has declared 2025 as the year of glacier preservation. Here's how to visit one safely\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Anna Fiorentino Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nWith glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late.\n\nOn an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day.\n\n\"Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,\" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.\n\nThe reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 – and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.\n\n\"Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,\" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nSadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center.\n\nAlamy Italy's Marmolada glacier could disappear by 2040 as temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThese slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nBut travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely – they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming.\n\nWhile 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution.\n\nWapta Icefield, British Columbia, Canada\n\nMountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer train to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs.\n\nShaun King Columbia Icefield visitors can walk on the glacier and learn about its geological features (Credit: Shaun King)\n\nIf you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny.\n\n\"The primary danger is crevasses – deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,\" says de Montigny. \"Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments.\"\n\nMendenhall, Alaska\n\nMendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the \"Glacier State\". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.\n\nSince it has been melting excessively in recent years, you'll need to join a helicopter tour to get more than a look out at the glacier; to hike it (or fly over it) try Alaska Shore Excursions. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.)\n\nAlamy Mendenhall is one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle (Credit: Alamy)\n\nNote: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.\n\nMarmolada, Italian Dolomites\n\nIt's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the \"Queen of the Dolomites\", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier \"Ice City\".\n\nCrevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial – Andrea Milani\n\nIf you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. \"Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.\n\n\"Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,\" he adds. \"If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones – don't hang around under them longer than necessary.\"\n\nMer de Glace, France\n\nIt's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier – transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours – has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year.\n\nAlamy The Mer de Glace ice cave has to be dug out each summer since the glacier shifts as much as 70m every year (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSince last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through – originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

She wasn't referring to her own works, yet admirers of the best-selling US author would argue that this is exactly what she has achieved, with acclaimed novels including Bel Canto, and the Pulitzer Prize-shortlisted The Dutch House, along with her award-winning 2005 memoir, Truth and Beauty: A Friendship.\n\nPatchett, who cites John Updike and Roxane Gay as influences on her deep body of work, brushes off praise. Reflecting on her books, she says that it took her years to finally feel like she was a successful writer, even when The New York Times included the prize-winning 2001 novel Bel Canto in its best books of the 21st Century list.\n\n\"I just didn't think you could make art and be successful,\" she tells the BBC's Katty Kay. They sat down at Parnassus Books, the bookshop Patchett she opened in 2011 in Nashville, Tennessee, a city which is also the setting for her 1992 novel The Patron Saint of Liars and her 2013 memoir-fiction hybrid, This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage. \"[It] never occurred to me.\"\n\nNatassja Ebert Patchett has no social media, saying that nobody should have access to her at all times (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nSome may see an author opening a bookshop as self-serving, but Patchett explains that she approached it like a civic duty. She didn't want to live in a city without one, and after she saw her local bookshops shutting, she co-founded her own.\n\n\"It wasn't that I wanted to open a bookstore – I really fell into it backwards,\" she says. \"It's been a wonderful thing. It's been a huge joy.\"\n\nPatchett rose to prominence in the world of fiction, crafting stories that brought together unexpected situations, and even more unexpected characters. Take, for instance, the home for unwed mothers in The Patron Saint of Liars or the depths of the Amazon rainforest in 2011's State of Wonder. She describes the scenarios in her books as \"people in confinement\", even though the stories span everything from events on a meditation retreat to hostage situations – and her own memoirs.\n\nI am very interested in protecting my brain and not just being constantly interrupted. I've never texted – that seems like a really bad idea – Ann Patchett\n\n\"The setting is the fun,\" she says of that commonality, though she's quick to point out that there's always something deeper going on. Readers have been transported to Alpine peaks, the jungles of South America, the cities of Los Angeles and Chicago – but Patchett points out that within those far-flung places, it's first and foremost the characters that she hopes fans connect with. \"The setting is the frosting, but it is always the relationships.\"\n\nPatchett has said before she doesn't watch television and that she has resisted the siren song of social media.\n\n\"I am very interested in protecting my brain and not just being constantly interrupted,\" she tells Kay. She uses a flip phone, she doesn't remember her number and she avoids both smartphones and social media. \"I've never texted. That seems like a really bad idea. I don't want people to be able to get me all the time.\"\n\nAnn Patchett says there are people who want to read\n\nShe may not participate, but she is aware of the digital world – and it does make its way into her work. When Kay asks her how she captures readers' attention when they all have feeds to scroll, Patchett doesn't see this as an issue.\n\n\"There are always going to be people who want to read,\" she says. \"There isn't one truth about the way people are, how they get their entertainment, how they get their education.\"\n\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.\n\nReflecting on the characters in her books, Patchett explains that she is more drawn to kindness than anything else. When she looks at everything happening around her, she doesn't just see chaos and doom.\n\n\"In my novels, there probably is more kindness than you might see in other books, but not more kindness than you might see in your daily life,\" she says.\n\nWhen Commonwealth, her seventh novel, was published in 2016, she spoke to fellow writer Zadie Smith, who offered an insight that Patchett had never considered.\n\nNatassja Ebert Patchett is the author of nine novels and five works of nonfiction (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\n\"'Autobiographical fiction isn't what has happened to us. It's what we're afraid of happening. It's what we fixate on and think about and worry about,'\" Patchett recalls Smith saying. \"In that moment, I thought, what am I afraid of? Who am I afraid of being? What do I think about all the time?\"\n\nAddressing those questions head-on has allowed Patchett to craft characters that have resonated with readers. She says that her fans bring her first-edition hardcover copies of Bel Canto at festivals (she's quick to remind everyone that every hardcover of Bel Canto is a first edition), and tell her that she's managed to create something very special with every book.\n\nAs ever, she downplays such praise. \"I do it because I love to do it, I don't feel any pressure,\" she says. \"If I never wrote a book again, the world would keep going just fine.\"\n\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Elephants hate bees – here's why that's good news for Kenyan farmers\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Gennaro Tomma Share Save\n\nMeha Kumar/ Save the Elephants\n\nFarmers are turning bees into unexpected helpers to keep elephants off their crops.\n\nAround the world, spreading farmland is increasingly overlapping with elephant habitats, often resulting in dangerous interactions as elephants roam over people's crops. But in Kenya, after decades of investigation, researchers have come up with a simple but ingenious solution to deter elephants: strings of beehive fences.\n\nInspired by longtime local knowledge of elephants' dislike of beehives, these buzzing barriers are offering a gentle but effective way of de-escalating the sometimes-violent interactions between farmers and elephants. And they are now spreading across the world, from Mozambique to Thailand.\n\nSo what is it about bees that elephants hate so much? And can they really be expected to keep the peace in this ever more crowded world?\n\nIt's ingenious. You've got this natural mechanism by which you can deter these animals from approaching farms – Graeme Shannon\n\n\"Expansion of agricultural land, logging, urbanisation, and shrinking and fragmentation of elephant habitats – wildlife that require large spaces of land – [are] forcing elephants to enter human settlements in search of food and water,\" says Greta Francesca Iori, an Ethiopia-based advisor on elephant conservation and human-elephant conflict for several governments and non-profits.\n\n\"Wherever there are elephants, there are instances and information coming through of human-elephant conflict.\"\n\nIn Kenya, a new kind of fence made of beehives keeps elephants at bay\n\nGraeme Shannon, a wildlife ecologist at Bangor University in Wales, UK, who has studied African elephants for two decades, notes that the people pushed into these areas are often of poorer backgrounds. \"So farming is crucial for them and their families.\"\n\nBut water and lush, highly nutritional crops can be very appealing for elephants, leading them close to human settlements.\n\nPeople take a lot of time caring for their land, then the elephants come \"when you have planted the crops and they are almost mature\", says Emmanuel Mwamba, a farmer who lives in Mwakoma, Kenya, a village at the frontline of human-elephant conflict. \"If elephants come there… everything is gone.\"\n\n\"Some of us […] rely on crops for subsistence\", adds Mwamba. \"Imagine if that was destroyed within a night.\"\n\nSuch encounters can be fatal for both sides. Farmers can die trying to stop hungry, seven-tonne elephants from entering their crops, while the elephants can end up getting killed by humans for happening upon a good meal.\n\nTo prevent these conflicts, scientists and locals have spent decades testing a variety of solutions to deter elephants, from electric fences, watchtowers and solar spotlights to chilli-greased bricks and smelly elephant repellents, or even simply using noises to scare the elephants – all with their own pros and cons.\n\nBut using bees to scare away elephants has emerged as a particularly promising and efficient tool, combining effective deterrence with a host of other benefits for farmers.\n\nWe started with two beehive fences. Now we have 700 hives covering three villages. It's a good thing for the community right now – Emmanuel Mwamba\n\nIt all started back in the early 2000s, when Fritz Vollrath, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and chairman of charity Save the Elephants, and Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save The Elephants, heard a folklore story from Kenyan pastoralists about how trees in certain areas were not damaged by elephants because they had beehives in them.\n\nSave the Elephants Studies have found bees are an effective way of deterring elephants away from crops (Credit: Save the Elephants)\n\nInspired by the tale, Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton began working with Lucy King, co-existence director at Save the Elephants, to investigate scientifically whether bees could really scare the giant pachyderms. By 2007 their research had led them to conclude that elephants not only stay away from trees containing beehives of wild African honeybees, but \"also rumble to each other to tell each other to stay away\", King says. \"We know that they can get stung, and we know that they never forget.\"\n\nKing designed a tool farmers could use to protect their crops from hungry elephants: a fence made of beehives. She first tested the idea in 2008 in a community in Laikipia, Kenya, which suffered from regular elephant crop-raids.\n\nThe fence goes all around a farm, with hives placed every 10m (33ft) between two posts. Lured in with natural attractants such as beeswax and lemongrass oil, African honeybees naturally colonise the beehives.\n\n\"For one acre [0.4 hectares] of farmland, you need 24 beehives,\" King says. However, just 12 of these are real: every other one is a dummy beehive – a fake made of just a yellow piece of plywood that gives the elephants the illusion that there are more beehives than there really are. This reduces costs and gives more space to the bees. \"As an elephant approaches in the dark, and they can smell bees, and they can smell honey, they can see a load of yellow boxes. They don't know which one is real and which one is fake. So it's an illusion. And it seems to work,\" King says.\n\nOther than deterring elephants from the crops and so providing food security, the beehive fences can bring other benefits to the communities who use them.\n\nFor one thing, they can generate an additional income for the farmers by producing honey. \"If a farmer has honey and has crops, it's actually good enough for the family to go on,\" says Mwamba, who lives in one of the villages where the beehive fences have been tested and has now become a beehive fence project officer for Save the Elephants, teaching other farmers how to build and maintain the fences.\n\nJane Wynyard/ Save the Elephants As well as deterring elephants, beehive fences can help farmers gain an additional income by selling honey (Credit: Jane Wynyard/ Save the Elephants)\n\nWomen are \"often disproportionately impacted by human elephant conflict\", adds King: it's often women who work in the farms and need to scare the elephants away, risking injury. For them, \"feeling more empowered in their situations means that they can actually get on with the job of looking after their household, maybe going back to school, maybe making sure they have time to do the other things\", King says.\n\nOver the years, King and other researchers have collected a body of evidence about the efficiency of beehive fences in Kenya, and today the fences are being tried and studied in dozens of other countries including Tanzania, Mozambique and Sri Lanka. Proof of the method's efficiency also comes from Thailand, another country where human-elephant conflict is an everyday issue.\n\nIn 2024, King and her colleagues published a long-term study that analysed the effectiveness of beehive fences over nine years in two small villages in southern Kenya: Mwambiti and Mwakoma, where Emmanuel Mwamba lives. These communities are highly reliant on crops, such as cabbage and maize, that attract the many elephants that cross between the East and West side of Tsavo National Park, which hosts around 15,000 elephants – the largest population in Kenya.\n\nThe researchers worked in close contact with locals, installing and collecting data on the beehive fences. Out of almost 4,000 elephants which approached the beehive fences, 75% of them were deterred by the fences, the study found. The farmers also made $2250 (£1,740) from selling honey.\n\nGetty Images Charity Mwangome ploughs her farmland using a hoe next to a beehive fence around her farm in Taita Taventa County, Kenya (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's ingenious,\" says Shannon, who wasn't involved in the research. \"You've got this natural mechanism by which you can deter these animals from approaching farms. I just think it's brilliant.\"\n\nStill, the study also revealed some of the weaknesses of the tool, Shannon adds. For example, the bee populations plummeted during drought years due to a lack of flowering plants. In 2018, when the hives were still recovering from the previous year's drought, an unusually large number of elephants entered the villages, and the fences managed to deter only around 73%. \"Like any single method or any single tool, it has caveats and limitations to how effective it can be,\" says Shannon.\n\nKing says she also worries about the impact of climate change on beehive fences, \"because if you have these erratic droughts happening every four years, rather than every 15-20 years like they used to happen, you're in trouble because the bees don't recover in time\". Excessive rain can also be a problem for the bees, she adds, as it can knock flowers down from trees and bushes.\n\nCarbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nA solution, the researchers suggest, is implementing other tools which can work together with the beehive fences, such as chilli briquettes or watchtowers. \"Without question, there is no one solution,\" says King.\n\nBut thinking on a larger scale, says Iori, while such local solutions can be helpful in mitigating human-elephant conflict, they can be put at risk by both climatic and geopolitical shocks, which in turn can \"significantly reduce people's belief\" in them. \"We need to have always a multi-pronged approach, where you're also dealing with higher level issues of: How do we engage government? How do we create belief? How do we reduce the pressure, both on elephants and people, at a systemic level… which is often to do with a lot more complex things,\" she says.\n\nFor now, though, the beehive fences are helping Mwamba's and other communities. \"We started with two beehive fences. Now we have 700 hives covering three villages,\" says Mwamba. \"It's a good thing for the community right now.\" Nowadays, he adds, people believe they need to co-exist with elephants.\n\nBefore the introduction of beehive fences, \"the elephants had crop-raided most of the farms here,\" Mwamba recalls. \"Right now, people can easily live without fear.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Their leaves turn brown and brittle to the touch but, given water, they will regreen within hours. Within a day, they've returned to their former self and can continue to photosynthesise.\n\nWhile such a Lazarus-like ability is common among mosses, ferns and other non-flowering plants, these \"resurrection plants\" belonged to the angiosperms, or flowering plants, the group that includes every blossoming tree and fruit-bearing, seed-carrying crop. But out of the 352,000 known species of flowering plants only 240 are resurrection plants. Scattered across this branch of the tree of life, they are often unrelated, each having independently evolved the ability to live without water. Primarily found growing on the rocky slopes or gravelly soils of South Africa, Australia and South America, the tactics used for this zombie-like trick are surprisingly similar – almost as if an ancestral toolkit can be retrieved from deep inside their DNA to deal with the problem of drought.\n\nFarrant, now a professor of desiccation tolerance at the University of Cape Town, has been studying these unusual plants for over three decades. Along with several other researchers, she believes the drought-resistant powers found in their genes may be key to adapting agriculture to a future of climate change.\n\nTanya Baber Jill Farrant with a Myrothamnus flabellifolia, which can survive for nine months without water (Credit: Tanya Baber)\n\nFor plants to survive for months without water may seem like science-fiction. The vast majority of plants do indeed die when they experience water loss of 10-30%. But resurrection plants are able to tolerate over 95% water loss.\n\nBut it's not just the ability to survive drought that is important for these species, says Carlos Messina, a maize scientist at the University of Florida. It's also how resurrection plants regrow following drought.\n\nMaize plants might also survive after a drought, he says, \"but when they rehydrate, they don't go back to the same leaf architecture they had before, and the flow of CO2 and water is all messed up\". Drought therefore compromises their growth long after the rains have returned.\n\nBut resurrection plants \"seem to come back to the form that they had before the drought,\" he says. \"If we can create maize that does that, that's fantastic, because we can regain that productivity.\"\n\nResurrection plants have evolved this essential skill by replacing disappearing water with sugars such as sucrose, turning the inside of their cells into a viscous, glass-like substance that slows down any chemical reactions. Known as vitrification, the same tactic is used by desiccation-tolerant animals such as tardigrades (also known as water bears) and the eggs of Artemia shrimp (sea monkeys).\n\nAs they turn to glass, these plants also deconstruct their photosynthetic machinery (such as chloroplasts), switching off their primary source of food as they turn to a state of dormancy. To hold their assembly of proteins and cell membranes together, they secrete a suite of protective proteins known as \"chaperones\", since they guide the cell through dangerous times.\n\n\"How they preserve their tissue is quite a miracle,\" Farrant says.\n\nAlamy Selaginella lepidophylla can survive months of drought then revive within hours (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn a sense, the abilities of resurrection plants are not so different to the seeds of most flowering plants. When dried and stored in a dark and cold place, many seeds can survive for years, sometimes millennia, preserving the recipe to make a new plant when warmth and water return.\n\nHype Metre The fascinating ability of resurrection plants to survive intact without water for months has obvious appeal in a world seeing rising desertification and increasingly erratic drought. If these same traits could be used in crops, it could help maintain food production in areas which are drying up. But altering the genomes of organisms remains controversial in remains in many areas of the world. It's also early days for this research, although genes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in some food crops.\n\nBut once the first green shoot emerges, this \"desiccation tolerance\" is lost, traded for faster growth, high yield and more nutritious fruit or seeds. It's a trait that the green revolution, the 20th Century agriculture boom which introduced high-yielding varieties of crops grown in optimum conditions of water, soil and Sun, exacerbated.\n\nMeanwhile, while droughts have always been an issue for farmers, rising global temperatures due to ongoing greenhouse gas emissions are making them far worse, especially in the Mediterranean and western North America. Drought, wildfires and heat are estimated to have cost $16.6bn (£12.9m) in crop losses in the US alone in 2023. According to some climate models, by 2100 much of the agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa and South America will be unsuitable for food production, a large proportion made barren by drought.\n\n\"Agriculture will only be possible in Canada and Siberia,\" says Henk Hilhorst, a retired seed scientist based in the Netherlands. It is these northerly regions of the planet, not the tropics, that will have to feed the world.\n\nThe situation is so severe, argues Farrant, that even the most radical shifts in agriculture now have to be considered. \"We're just not going to get enough food,\" she says. \"So we've got to become incredibly inventive.\"\n\nThe most common crop plants such as wheat, maize and soybean have already been made more resilient to water scarcity through selective breeding. Choosing plants with greater root depth helps them find deeper reserves of water, for example, or choosing those that flower faster helps produce seeds in a shorter growing season.\n\nAlamy Resurrection ferns are more common than resurrection flowering plants, but their genes are also further from the crops humans use for food (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut extreme weather events aren't just becoming more common, they are becoming more unpredictable. Chaos is the marker of climate change, says Timothy George, a soil scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland. \"There's just much more variability.\" Periods without water occurring out of the blue – known as flash droughts – are becoming more common, as are droughts that occur during months of the year once guaranteed rain and mild conditions.\n\nThis means that avoiding drought may stop being possible. That's why Farrant and other scientists are investigating whether they can find a way to recreate the remarkable desiccation tolerance of resurrection plants in ordinary food crops.\n\nTo introduce such talents to rice, maize and wheat was long thought to require the use of \"transgenic\" genetic modification – introducing DNA into their genome from distant relatives in the plant kingdom. The genes involved in desiccation tolerance would be isolated and inserted into drought-sensitive crops, a task that has been made simpler with the recent rise of Crispr gene editing technologies.\n\nBut Farrant's recent studies suggest that many of the genes used to survive desiccation are the same as those found in seeds of most flowering plants. To create drought-resistant crops, therefore, might not require any new genes at all; by activating the same genetic toolkit found in their seeds, a mature plant might be made more resilient to drying out. As this would involve activating genes that have simply been silenced upon germination, rather than inserting foreign genes from other plants, it may not be as controversial as some other genetically-modified crops.\n\nJulia Buitink, a seed biologist at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research in Paris, agrees it's a feasible approach, even if the effect were limited to the young seedlings of the crop. Seedlings could be an easier target, she says, primarily because this stage of growth follows germination, and extending desiccation tolerance would be the most logical first step. Plus, because most desiccation-tolerant organisms are small, these seedlings would fit the mould already found in nature.\n\nExtinct tree from the time of Jesus rises from the dead\n\nStill, while these techniques are feasible in any laboratory in the world, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge when it comes to how these plants survive desiccation, especially when it comes to howeach adaptation is controlled. \"I think we know the main genes,\" says Buitink. \"The problem is the higher level – how can we switch them on when there is drought? And for that we really don't know much about it.\"\n\nThe genetic switches that have been identified, Buitink adds, are often not specific to one thing: turn on desiccation tolerance, she says, and you will almost certainly change many other parts of the plant – and most importantly, may decrease its yield. \"Which, for crops, is exactly what you don't want.\"\n\nBut if a \"master switch\" – a gene specific to inducing desiccation tolerance – can be found, it could be turned on only when water scarcity becomes an issue, ensuring that the yield of these crops would be unaffected if conditions are conducive to growth. Just as a resurrection plant only shrivels into a crinkle of brown leaves during the long dry season, a crop plant might only batten down the hatches when a flash drought comes out of the blue.\n\nThis is exactly what researchers in Kenya and Sweden achieved in 2018 when they introduced a single gene from Xerophyta viscosa – a resurrection plant also known as the small black-stick lily – into a variety of sweet potato. Known to be important in antioxidant defence, the gene, known as XvAld1, made these transgenic potato plants more resilient to a 12-day dehydration experiment. Compared to their wild-type neighbours, they remained greener for longer, lost fewer leaves, and grew taller even when deprived of water. Importantly, they were indistinguishable before the dehydration experiment began, suggesting the gene had no impact on growth or leaf structure.\n\nGenes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in other plants too, including the lab favourite Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco plants. Still, with genetically-modified crops of any kind still required to fit stringent legal check-lists (particularly in the EU), Farrant has started to look for other ways to induce these remarkable traits of resurrection plants into crops grown today.\n\nJill Farrant Desiccation tolerance expert Jill Farrant first noticed the remarkable abilities of resurrection plants when she was a child (Credit: Jill Farrant)\n\nJust as the microbiome is a hot topic in human health, the root microbiome (or rhizosphere) is gaining interest in agricultural science. Drought tolerance might not be just in the leaves and stems, but in the roots. \"This is where there might be [potential] for groups like resurrection plants or other extreme species,\" says George. \"If there's a microbiome element to their ability to cope with extreme stress, then you might be able to transfer that into a cropping system much more easily than, say, genetic components.\"\n\nAnd this is exactly what Farrant is trying to do. Along with her colleagues Shandry Tebele and Rose Marks, she has begun to map the microbiome of the Myrothamnus flabellifolia, a species that is unique even among resurrection plants. Growing in gravelly soil in South Africa, it can grow to waist-height and is more like a bush than a lonely patch of grass. Even with such complexity and size, it can survive for nine months or more without water.\n\nThe researchers first survey of M. flabellifolia's rhizosphere, published in 2024, revealed over 900 unique bacterial and fungal groups, the beginning of what might become a drought-tolerant probiotic that can be used for other plants.\n\nAboveground, though, it is Farrant's work on teff that may be most auspicious. A naturally gluten-free cereal, teff has been grown for thousands of years in Ethiopia. Its tolerance to water scarcity has long led to it being lauded as a potential more sustainable and climate-resilient crop, but Farrant is interested in this species for slightly different reasons. Teff is the only crop that has a resurrection plant as a close relative: Eragrostis nindensis, a waist-height grass that grows on rocky slopes across southern Africa. Learning how these plants differ in their responses to drought might reveal which genes have been lost or switched off – and whether these can be reinserted back into teff, a genetic modification that is more likely to be successful given their close relationship.\n\nAlamy Teff, a cereal grown for millennia in Ethiopia, has a resurrection plant as a close relative (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIt's a work still in its infancy. But already it seems that protection against sunlight is one of the main differences between the two. E. nindensi produces antioxidants inside its leaves and a coating of anthocyanins – essentially a plant's version of sun cream – on its external surfaces. Teff doesn't have this ability. It's a delicate balance for E. nindensi to pull off: sunlight is essential for a water-filled plant to grow, but during drought it can be lethal, leading to uncontrolled photosynthesis, the production of reactive oxygen species, and damage from UV radiation. For teff to have this option, however, might allow it to survive the harshest drought and grow another day.\n\nSo the tiny seeds of teff, milled to make flour for bread and pancakes, might just hold the key to a more sustainable agriculture. Just as maize, rice and wheat were bred for higher yields at the expense of resilience in the 20th Century's Green Revolution, such crops would add resilience, even if at the cost of a slightly lower yield. \"They might have a low yield but the subsistence farmer has a crop,\" Farrant. \"This is regardless of whether it rains in 10 days or two years.\"\n\n* Alex Riley is science writer and author of Super Natural: How Life Thrives in Impossible Places.

        "content": "Spaghetti science: What pasta reveals about the universe\n\n1 day ago Share Save Joseph Howlett Share Save\n\nBBC/ Getty Images/ Beatrice Britton (Credit: BBC/ Getty Images/ Beatrice Britton)\n\nWhen you see pasta, your brain probably doesn't jump to the secrets of the universe. But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\n\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\n\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\n\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto – the word for an individual strand of spaghetti – is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\n\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\n\nFor now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand\n\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\n\nA messy science\n\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\n\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip – and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\n\nBeatrice Britton University College London researcher made spaghetti just 0.1mm (0.004in) thick. The tiny noodles could have applications for medicine and biotechnology (Credit: Beatrice Britton)\n\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\n\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\n\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself – sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries\n\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces – at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\n\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave – delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\n\nA mechanical wonder\n\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\n\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length – something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" – a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\n\nGetty Images For physicists, noodles are more than just dinner: they can help unlock some of the universe's deepest mysteries (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\n\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself – sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\n\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients – it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese – but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\n\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\nSpaghetti science shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day\n\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\n\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\n\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\n\nGetty Images For scientists, the sauce has answers too. Italian physicists have tied the chemical properties of cacio e pepe to questions about the origins of life (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\n\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\n\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe – a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\n\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians’ mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\n\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\n\nFor one, it's simple – flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\n\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world – spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\n\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Colin Anderson/Blend Images/Getty Images\n\nCertificates of deposit (CD) accounts have spiked in popularity in recent years among savers seeking to take advantage of a sharp rise in their yields. According to January 2022 data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the average rate for a five-year CD was a paltry 0.28%. At the time, even the best five-year CDs only offered yields of around 1.30%.\n\nThat changed and rates soared when the Federal Reserve launched its aggressive series of rate hikes from 2022 to 2023 to slow 40-year high inflation. Ultimately, rates peaked in 2023, and savers could easily find top CDs offering yields of 5.5% or more.\n\nHowever, yields began to dip when the Fed made a jumbo rate cut in September 2024, its first move to lower rates in four years. But even after the rate cut, CDs remain a solid option. Today's CD rates are still strong, with top options earning in the 4% to 4.5% range.\n\nTo make the most of these rates, many savvy investors are using strategies like CD ladders, barbells and bullets to maximize earnings and flexibility. Choosing the right strategy depends on where the economy is headed and what fits your financial situation best.\n\nStart reviewing your top CD account options here now.\n\nWhich CD account strategy makes the most sense now?\n\nThere is no uniform answer to this question as each CD account strategy differs in benefits based on the individual saver. Here's why each could be advantageous now:\n\nCD ladders\n\nLet's say you're earning 4% on your savings in a long-term CD. It's a solid return, but if rates climb, you could be missing out on even higher earnings. On the other hand, if you go with a short-term CD to keep your options open and rates fall, you might end up with a lower return instead of locking in a higher rate for the long run.\n\nOne strategy to manage this risk is CD laddering. To create a CD ladder, you'll divide your funds among multiple CDs with various maturity dates. This helps you maximize returns while giving you more options with greater access to your money.\n\n\"A CD ladder is one of the most effective strategies for savers looking to balance higher yields with flexibility,\" says Michael Crossley, vice president of treasury processing at America First Credit Union. \"If rates decline in 2025, those who used a ladder will have already secured some funds at favorable rates. Meanwhile, as shorter-term CDs mature, savers can decide whether to reinvest or explore alternative options.\"\n\nCompare your current CD account options here to see if a ladder strategy makes sense for you.\n\nCD barbell\n\nA CD ladder approach can include accounts of different term lengths. A CD barbell strategy, on the other hand, will not. This approach splits your money among short-term and long-term CDs. With no middle-range options, it resembles a barbell, with CD accounts weighted at both ends.\n\nLet's say you have $10,000 to invest in CDs. With a CD barbell strategy, you might put $5,000 in a short-term six-month CD and the other $5,000 in a long-term five-year CD. In this case, you'd have the short-term option to access your money in six months—either to use it or reinvest—while still retaining the long-term benefit of a locked rate.\n\n\"The benefits of this approach are similar to traditional ladder benefits, but without a series of CDs maturing at regular intervals,\" says Derik Farrar, head of personal deposits at U.S. Bank.\n\n\"Implementing multiple CD ladders over time is the best way to maintain exposure to various term points on the yield curve to mitigate the risk of unfavorable swings in interest rates. Since deploying this strategy typically requires a significant amount of funds, savers should consider a barbell approach at minimum to gain some exposure to short- and long-term rates,\" he adds.\n\nCD bullet\n\nA CD bullet strategy eschews the idea of staggering CD term maturity dates and instead puts all of your funds into CDs that mature at the same time. \"This can be a useful strategy if you are saving for a big purchase at the end, like a down payment on a house or a wedding,\" explains Shana Hennigan, chief business officer at Raisin, a savings marketplace. \"So you might buy a two-year CD, then six months later purchase an 18-month CD, then eight months later buy a 10-month CD.\"\n\n\"With the CD bullet strategy, your reason for opening a CD matters more than the state of the economy. But that doesn't mean interest rates don't play a role. While economists expect rates to hold for now and fall by year's end, uncertainty in the economy could lead the Fed to pause rate cuts. If you think rates will rise, keeping your money in shorter-term CDs lets you reinvest at higher yields later. If you expect rates to drop, you might get a better return by locking in a long-term CD that matures right when you need the funds—whether for a home purchase, tuition, or another goal.\"\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe best CD strategy for you likely depends on where the economy is headed, your financial goals and how much risk you're comfortable with. If your risk tolerance level is high, a traditional CD ladder may make sense.\n\n\"Your best bet is to have a traditional CD strategy and lock in current rates with the dollars you have available to save,\" says Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin. \"Most rates are hovering in the 4% to 4.5% range, and while it's always possible they could move up, with our current economic picture, it seems increasingly unlikely.\"\n\nHowever, if you prefer a more conservative approach other strategies may be a better fit. As Beene points out, \"Any CD strategy other than a traditional one—like bullet or barbell that lean in favor of savers dividing up the sums they put in over time or in different CDs—may still have a place, but they'll be more for those who are looking to set aside money over time and averse to the risk of other financial products.\"",

        "content": "What to know about ICE arresting a Georgetown researcher on student visa\n\nWashington — A federal judge on Thursday blocked the government from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.\n\nBadar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"\n\nAttorneys for Suri filed a writ of habeas corpus and accompanying complaint challenging his detention in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Tuesday, one day after his arrest. CBS News obtained the documents on Thursday.\n\nIn an order later in the day, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.\"\n\nThe complaint filed by Suri's attorneys said he was surrounded and detained by masked DHS agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, where he lives with his wife Mapheze Saleh and their three children, after breaking his fast for Ramadan on March 17.\n\n\"The agents identified themselves as members of the Department of Homeland Security and stated that the government had revoked his visa,\" the complaint said, adding that \"the agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes.\"\n\nRoughly two hours after his arrest, Suri called his wife to let her know that he was being sent to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said. They added that they believe he is likely to be moved to a detention facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. As of Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator showed Suri was being held at a detention facility in Louisiana. His lawyers have filed a motion seeking his return to Virginia.\n\nSuri's attorneys said his \"unjustified detention\" violated his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.\n\nA Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa in order \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"\n\nIn its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\"\n\nThe DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe detention follows ICE agents' controversial March 8 arrest in New York City of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.\n\nThe 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News last week, DHS alleged Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,\" alleging the former student \"led activities aligned to Hamas,\" but without providing evidence of the claim or detailing any alleged criminal charges against him.\n\nA federal judge ruled Wednesday that Khalil's case can be heard in New Jersey, rather than New York or Louisiana. Khalil was briefly held at a detention facility in New Jersey before being moved to Louisiana.",

His firing was unanimously approved by Israel's cabinet.\n\n\"The Government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office,\" a statement said.\n\nBar, meant to end his tenure only next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.\n\nHis relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country.\n\nRelations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack.\n\nIt acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said \"a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup.\"\n\nBar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nLong-term CDs give you the opportunity to earn today's rates for up to 5 or even 10 years. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nSaving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation. After all, if your money doesn't earn a return that's at least equal to inflation, it will lose buying power. But, a certificate of deposit (CD) can help. That's because today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate.\n\nHowever, strong current returns aren't the only reason to invest in these savings vehicles either. You can lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD. Moreover, they're safe investments, generally coming with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000.\n\nStart your journey by comparing top CD rates and earn more today.\n\nWhat are today's CD interest rates?\n\nDepending on your CD type, terms and other details, there's a varying range of CD rates you can qualify for today. The following CD rates are the current national averages for specific terms as of March 21, 2025, according to Bankrate.\n\n1-year CD yield: 1.86% APY\n\n1.86% APY 3-year CD yield: 1.54% APY\n\n1.54% APY 5-year CD yield: 1.54% APY\n\nThese averages look much different from the actual rates available on top CDs today, though. Here are some of the best CD rates by term today:\n\n6-month CD rates\n\nBread Savings — 4.50% APY\n\nBask Bank — 4.45% APY\n\nAmerica First Credit Union — 4.35% APY\n\n1-year CD rates\n\nBask Bank — 4.40% APY\n\nAmerica First Credit Union — 4.35% APY\n\nCitizens Access — 4.35% APY\n\n3-year CD rates\n\nAmerica First Credit Union — 4.15% APY\n\nSchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union — 4.15% APY\n\nPopular Direct — 4.10% APY\n\n5-year CD rates\n\nSchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union — 4.25% APY\n\nAmerica First Credit Union — 4.20% APY\n\nSynchrony Bank — 4.15% APY\n\nWant the best CD for your savings? Compare top rates here and start earning more money today!\n\nHow to get a good CD rate\n\nUse these strategies to lock in the best CD rate right now.\n\nLook at online banks\n\nThere's a big difference between national average savings rates and the top interest rates available. In part, that's because different types of banks often have very different rates.\n\nOnline banks and online divisions of larger banks have fewer overhead costs to keep up their day-to-day operations, since there are no physical bank branches. Typically these are the banks with rates that have kept up with Fed changes over the past several year. Today, you're most likely to find CDs with competitive rates from online banks.\n\nBy contrast, large banks with branches across the country — where you may keep your checking account for convenience and easy access to branches and ATMs — often have lower CD and savings rates. Many of these banks' CDs are below average and may even still be close to zero.\n\nConsider short-term CDs\n\nCD terms can range from around one to three months to 10 years. But often, short-term CDs are the best way to get a top rate today.\n\nBut the overall economic environment has made it so short-term CDs (around six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms right now. Bankrate's data actually specifies that one-year CD yields have surpassed five-year yields consistently since October 2022.\n\nThe phenomenon is called the inverted yield curve. \"This means rates are highest for short term CDs and treasuries and actually are lower as you go out further in time,\" says Donald F. Dempsey, CFP, founder of Dempsey Investment Management.\n\nIn order to take advantage of those high rates while also saving for the long-term, \"A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs,\" Dempsey says. \"Buy some one year, some two years, some three years, etc.\"\n\nSee all the best short-term CD rates you can qualify for here.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nRight now, both CD rates and savings rates in general offer higher rates than have been seen in years. You can take advantage of the opportunity to lock in a great rate with flexible terms to help you reach your savings goals more quickly. Just make sure you compare different banking options and the term lengths that work for you in order to start maximizing your balance with the best CD rates available today.",

        "title": "Trump has called for a judge to be impeached. What to know — and why removal is unlikely",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — President Trump this week joined the growing chorus of calls to punish federal judges who rule against his administration. But impeachment and removal are unlikely under the current makeup of Congress.\n\nThe recent calls to impeach federal judges increased earlier this week when Mr. Trump posted on social media that a U.S. district judge overseeing his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members should be impeached.\n\nWhile the attack by Mr. Trump marked the first time he called for a judge to be impeached, his Republican allies and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have for weeks been denouncing members of the judiciary who have been overseeing the myriad legal challenges to the president's policies and ruled against the administration.\n\nIn the House, a small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers have introduced or signed onto resolutions to impeach four of those judges. While it's unlikely the efforts will gain enough traction to result in their removals, they have reignited the debate over impeachment and the high bar for removal for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nThe GOP calls to impeach a federal judge\n\nThe president called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment in a post on social media Tuesday, saying without naming him that \"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued the attacks on Boasberg and other judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration.\n\n\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she told reporters during a press briefing. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slowwalk this administration's agenda and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nLeavitt said the president \"has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached.\" She noted that the White House will comply with judicial orders and mount appeals of adverse rulings, as it has done so far but accused judges of undermining the will of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nPresident Trump listens as White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, speaks next to a Tesla Cyber Truck and a Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nFreshman Rep. Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg after Mr. Trump's post, alleging on social media that Boasberg \"is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\" Five Republicans have signed onto the impeachment articles as cosponsors.\n\nImpeachment resolutions have also been introduced against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, John Bates and Amir Ali. GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said last month that he was going to draft impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge John McConnell, but they do not appear to have been filed.\n\nHow does impeachment work?\n\nUnder the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" It's highly unlikely any of the judges who are targets of impeachment resolutions have met that high hurdle.\n\nAs with presidential impeachments, the power to impeach, convict and remove judges falls to Congress. While the House has impeachment power, under the Constitution, the Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine if impeached officials are guilty and should be removed from their post.\n\nAfter lawmakers bring articles of impeachment in the House, the articles must be adopted by a simple majority for impeachment. The House then transmits the impeachment articles to the Senate, which has the \"sole Power\" under the Constitution to hold a trial that could lead to conviction and removal from office.\n\nBut the Senate has a high bar for conviction, with a two-thirds majority required. Although Republicans have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, that falls short of the 67 senators needed to find an official guilty and remove them from office.\n\nThe next steps in Congress\n\nHow congressional leaders proceed to be seen.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff James Blair told Politico that \"it'll be up to the speaker\" to determine what can be passed and whether to pursue impeachment proceedings, while noting that the president is simply \"highlighting a critical issue.\"\n\n\"I think the president is right, we should impeach activist, partisan judges,\" Blair said. \"The question is, will that happen?\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson would have a number of choices if lawmakers choose to force a vote with a privileged resolution, including bringing the impeachment articles up for a risky vote, setting up a vote to table the measure, or referring it to committee.\n\nAn impeachment resolution would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for an investigation, where hearings would likely be held before advancing the impeachment articles before the full chamber. The panel's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday that for House Republicans and the Judiciary Committee, \"all options are still on the table.\"\n\nImpeachment proceedings would likely consume valuable time and attention that congressional Republicans are hoping to reserve for a massive budget package that would allow the president to implement much of his agenda.\n\nAsked whether an impeachment trial could impede the White House's agenda, Blair said he doubts \"a bunch of floor time will be spent on something if they strongly feel like they can't get the votes.\"\n\nHow has impeachment been used against judges in the past?\n\nJust 14 federal judges and one Supreme Court justice have ever been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.\n\nWho are the judges targeted for impeachment?\n\nRepublicans have introduced impeachment resolutions against four judges on the U.S. district courts after they issued preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.\n\nPaul Engelmayer: A judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Engelmayer was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011 and confirmed 98-0 by the Senate. The impeachment resolution against him claims he \"engaged in judicial misconduct\" because he temporarily blocked Trump administration officials from accessing sensitive Treasury Department databases last month.\n\nAmir Ali: Ali sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., and was appointed by former President Joe Biden. The Senate confirmed him in a 50-49 vote. Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's freeze on foreign assistance and issued a temporary order\n\nJohn Bates: Appointed to the district court in Washington, D.C., by former President George W. Bush in 2001, Bates' nomination was approved by the Senate in a unanimous 97-0 vote. The longtime judge is presiding over two challenges involving Mr. Trump's policies, including a challenge to the removal of certain health information from Department of Health and Human Services' websites. In February, he ordered the deleted webpages\n\nJames Boasberg: Boasberg, a judge on the U.S. district court in the nation's capital, has come under the fiercest of attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies after he temporarily blocked the administration\n\nWhat have the judges said?\n\nFollowing Mr. Trump's call for Boasberg to be impeached, Chief Justice John Roberts, the head of the federal judiciary, issued a rare statement rebuking the attack.\n\n\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" the chief justice said.\n\nWhile Roberts' statement was rare, it is not the first time he has spoken out in response to heated comments from politicians.\n\nIn March 2020, the chief justice denounced comments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, made outside the Supreme Court as \"inappropriate\" and \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,\" Roberts said in the statement released by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2018, he pushed back against comments Mr. Trump made during his first term about a judge who ruled against one of his asylum policies. The president called the judge an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThe U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" he said.",

        "content": "How a selfie of the suspect in the murders of Idaho college students could play a role in trial\n\nA flurry of court documents filed this week in the case of Bryan Kohberger, the man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in late 2022, offers new details about how the case against him is shaping up. Among those documents revealed by prosecutors is what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone just hours after the killings.\n\nKohberger, 30, is accused in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. Autopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times.\n\nKohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, was arrested in Pennsylvania weeks after the killings. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene. A defense attorney pushed to have the DNA evidence thrown out, but Judge Steven Hippler denied that request last month.\n\nKohberger has been charged with four counts of murder in the Nov. 13, 2022 stabbing. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty if he is convicted.\n\nWhen asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf.\n\nThe killings shook the small farming community of about 25,000 people, which hadn't had a homicide in about five years. The trial was moved from rural northern Idaho to Boise after the defense expressed concerns that Kohberger couldn't get a fair trial in the county where the killings occurred.\n\nFrom left: University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were found dead on November 13 at an off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho. CBS News\n\nThe newly filed documents include pretrial motions that will shape what evidence and expert testimony will be allowed at Kohberger's trial, which is set to begin Aug. 11 and expected to last more than three months.\n\nThey show that prosecutors intend to introduce evidence of Kohberger's \"click history\" at Amazon.com showing he purchased a Ka-Bar knife - a military-style, fixed-blade knife - along with a sheath and sharpener in March, eight months before the killings. A Ka-Bar knife was found next to one of the victims.\n\nFurther, prosecutors say, the Amazon click history also shows Kohberger searched for a Ka-Bar knife in the days after the killings.\n\n\"Kohberger's click activity after the homicides makes it more probable (than it would be without the evidence) that Kohberger had a reason to search for a Ka-Bar knife and sheath after the homicides,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nKohberger's attorneys have sought to exclude the online shopping history, saying it could be taken out of context or not reflect the influence of algorithms that recommend purchases.\n\nProsecutors say they also intend to introduce what appears to be a selfie Kohberger took on his phone at 10:31 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 - just hours after the killings. In it, he is smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture.\n\nThis photo released by the State of Idaho, which prosecutors claim to have been taken from Bryan Kohberger's phone, shows Kohberger, accused of slaying 4 University of Idaho students, gesturing in a selfie on Nov. 13, 2022, hours after the homicides occurred. State of Idaho via AP\n\nA roommate who was in the rental home, sleeping and intoxicated, told police she woke up and saw a man she didn't know - someone with \"bushy eyebrows\" who was wearing a face mask. Defense attorneys have asked the judge to exclude from the trial any description of the attacker having bushy eyebrows, saying that could prejudice the jury.\n\n\"If evidence of 'bushy eyebrows' is presented to the jury, the jury might well believe that Mr. Kohberger is guilty simply because of 'bushy eyebrows,'\" defense attorneys wrote.\n\nBut prosecutors say the roommate's description is credible, and they want to introduce Kohberger's selfie because it shows his appearance shortly after the killings. \"Whether or not Bryan Kohberger can be described as having 'bushy eyebrows' is a factual determination to be decided by the jury,\" they wrote.\n\nProsecutors have also presented a map that illustrates the locations where Kohberger's car was allegedly seen on surveillance video on the night of the murders, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reported.\n\nJudge Hippler has scheduled a hearing for April 9 to consider the pretrial motions. Among those to be decided are arguments over whether an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis would preclude Kohberger from being eligible for the death penalty if convicted, and over whether jurors should hear audio of a 911 call made by two women in the house roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up.\n\nThe court has issued a gag order for everyone involved in the trial and won't allow cameras in the courtroom.\n\nOther motions have been filed ahead of the trial, including a sealed defense motion to take the death penalty off the table that cited autism spectrum disorder. Other sealed motions include one on whether the terms \"psychopath\" or \"sociopath\" can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial.\n\nLast November, Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, said the details of the case show the death penalty is merited.\n\n\"You've got four victims, all in one house — that's more than enough,\" Steve Goncalves said.\n\nKristi Goncalves said she talked to the coroner and knows what happened to her daughter.\n\n\"If he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,\" she said.",

        "content": "NTSB recommends 68 bridges be evaluated for risk of collapse from vessel strike\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a \"vulnerability assessment\" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\n\nOver the last year, the NTSB identified 68 bridges built before 1991 that don't have a \"current vulnerability assessment.\" The recommendations were issued to 30 owners of the 68 different bridges across the country, NTSB officials announced Thursday.\n\nSome of the bridges include the Golden Gate Bridge in California, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida.\n\nIn response to the recommendation from the NTSB, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District said Thursday that the Golden Gate Bridge is \"in full compliance with all state and federal regulations\" and that the district hired a consultant this year to \"conduct an assessment of the South Tower fender system's structural capacity for ship collisions.\"\n\nThe NTSB noted that their recommendation does not suggest that the 68 bridges are certain to collapse, but rather those bridge owners evaluate whether the bridges are above the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' acceptable level of risk.\n\nThe 68 bridges were divided into two categories, \"critical/essential\" and \"typical.\" Those deemed critical/essential are those that serve as \"important links.\" The Key Bridge had this classification. Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation.\n\nThe recommendation comes as NTSB officials released new information in the Key Bridge collapse investigation Thursday. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River.\n\n\"Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge,\" NTSB said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe NTSB found that the Key Bridge was almost 30 times greater than the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the final report of the Baltimore incident will be released in the fall.\n\nThe 68 bridges the NTSB recommended for risk of collapse evaluation\n\nCalifornia: Richmond-San Rafael Bridge\n\nCalifornia: Carquinez Bridge\n\nCalifornia: Benicia-Martinez Bridge\n\nCalifornia: Antioch Bridge\n\nCalifornia: San Mateo-Hayward Bridge\n\nCalifornia: Coronado Bridge\n\nCalifornia: Golden Gate Bridge\n\nDelaware: Summit Bridge\n\nDelaware: Saint Georges Bridge\n\nDelaware: Reedy Point Bridge\n\nFlorida: Sunshine Skyway Bridge\n\nFlorida: Napoleon Bonaparte Broward Bridge (Dames Point Bridge)\n\nGeorgia: Talmadge Bridge\n\nIllinois: Chicago Skyway Calumet River Bridge\n\nLouisiana: Huey P.

        "content": "Washington — President Trump on Thursday rescinded an executive order targeting a prominent international law firm after it pledged to review its hiring practices and to provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.\n\nThe move follows a meeting between Mr. Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton, over the White House order issued last week.\n\nThe order, the latest in a series of similar actions targeting law firms whose lawyers have provided legal work that Mr. Trump disagrees with, threatened to suspend active security clearances of attorneys at Paul, Weiss and to terminate any federal contracts the firm has. It singled out the work of Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked at the firm and who oversaw an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office into Mr. Trump's finances before Mr. Trump became president.\n\nTo avoid those consequences, the White House said Paul, Weiss had agreed to \"take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society,\" to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions and to dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in free legal services to support Trump administration policies on issues including assistance for veterans and countering anti-Semitism.\n\nIn a statement issued by the White House, Karp said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nThe firm becomes the latest corporate target to make concessions to the president to avoid his ire.\n\nMeta and ABC made settlement payments to Mr. Trump's future presidential library to end lawsuits filed by Mr. Trump. Other tech and financial firms have publicly rolled back DEI programs in line with Mr. Trump's policy interests.\n\nEarlier executive orders have targeted the law firms of Perkins Coie, which last week sued in federal court in Washington, and Covington & Burling.",

Growing economic friction makes gold's stability more attractive.\n\nBeyond trade concerns, Brandon Aversano, CEO of The Alloy Market, highlights how interest rate uncertainty and U.S. dollar fluctuations are driving funds to use gold as protection against market instability.

However, Bryan emphasizes that you must understand your \"why\" before investing. If you're hedging against inflation, focus on long-term holdings. If you're trading, pay close attention to market indicators and entry points.\n\nBefore adding gold to your portfolio, speak with your financial advisor about what allocation makes sense for your situation. \"If you feel like a 1% to 5% allocation to gold makes sense for you, hedge fund and central bank activity shouldn't weigh into that buy decision,\" Yoshida advises.",

Remains of five mammoths were found by archaeologists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences said Thursday in a news statement.\n\nResearchers found mammoth bones in two areas, in Langmannersdorf an der Perschling, Lower Austria, located between St. Pölten and Tulln. Both zones, discovered about 50 feet apart, were densely packed with bones.\n\nIn one area, researchers found evidence that the mammoths were butchered with stone tools. The bones were left in several layers.\n\nRemains of three mammoths were discovered in the second area, their tusks dismembered and complete. The discovery of the tusks indicated that the area was used for ivory processing, researchers said.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Berlin — In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.\n\nOn Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.\n\nThe package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.\n\nMerz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.\n\nGermany's chancellor-in-waiting and leader of the Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) Friedrich Merz speaks during an extraordinary meeting of the German Bundestag to discuss a €500-billion infrastructure fund and a revamp of borrowing rules aimed at modernizing the military and stimulating economic growth ahead of the formation of a new parliament at end of March, in Berlin, Germany, March 13, 2025. Liesa Johannssen/REUTERS\n\nAt the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:\n\nFirst is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"\n\nThe other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nCan Merz make good on his defense spending plans?\n\nThere are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.\n\nEconomic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.\n\nChristian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"\n\nBut for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution — and even a clear commitment to one — could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.\n\nPresident Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.\n\nThe planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.\n\nGermany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.\n\nThe success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

The molten rock was contained within the park and wasn't threatening residential areas.\n\nThe 14th episode ended Thursday afternoon after 28 hours. During the last seven hours, lava fountains were up to 600 feet high, according to the USGS' Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nIn the early afternoon, a webcam's livestream showed vigorous, bright-red fountains but later only showed billowing smoke. One USGS webcam captured images of rock fragments flying over the volcano's rim.\n\nThis image from webcam footage provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows lava fountains shooting up high in the latest episode of an ongoing eruption of Kilauea volcano inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Thursday, March 20, 2025. United States Geological Survey via AP\n\nAnother stunning image captured by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory showed whirlpool textures in the lava pond's crustal plates, a phenomenon called lava drainback.\n\nThe volcano began its current eruption on Dec. 23. It has stopped and resumed more than a dozen times since. The shortest episode lasted 13 hours, while the longest lasted eight days.\n\nIn January, CBS affiliate KGMB reported that Kilauea put on a spectacular show with a 26-hour eruption, with live cameras showing a mixture of volcanic gas emissions and steam from the rain at the summit. A strong glow from the north vent indicated that lava remained close to the surface of the crater, scientists said.\n\nEach time, the volcano has sent lava shooting high into the sky from caldera vents, creating a dramatic sight for park visitors.\n\nThe eruption of the Kilauea volcano on March 11, 2025 in Volcano National Park, Hawaii.

Kilauea also erupted in June and September 2024.\n\nThe park, on Hawaii's Big Island, is about 200 miles south of Honolulu.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.\n\nShe granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.\n\n\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.\n\nLee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.\n\n\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.\n\nIn her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.\n\n\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.\n\nThe judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.\n\nThe Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"\n\n\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"\n\nShe accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.\n\n\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans — absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so — is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"\n\nMr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.\n\nBut DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.\n\nJust earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Tel Aviv — For a second night in a row, Israel's military launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.\n\nSeparately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.\n\n\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.\n\nThe statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"\n\nThe mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.\n\nEven before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire.\n\n\"It would be a blessing if this kid passed\"\n\nDr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries.\n\n\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"\n\nPerlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies – he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands – made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.\n\nSpeaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body – and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited – and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"\n\nIsraeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war\n\nBlack plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.\n\n\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"\n\nHamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nDemonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people… to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.\n\n\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"\n\nNational polls consistently show a majority of Israelis – 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.\n\nIsrael, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.\n\nWill Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?\n\nRetired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nBut the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.\n\n\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"\n\nZiv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"\n\nZiv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.\n\n\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"\n\nZiv disagrees with that assessment.\n\n\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"\n\n\"To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.\"",

He argued that the magazines can allow the gun to function better, and should be considered functional parts, not accessories. He said he had planned to voice his arguments in his dissent but found it \"obviously much more effective to simply show you.\" He stated that the guns featured in the video were inoperable for safety reasons.\n\nJudge Lawrence VanDyke holds up a firearm in his chambers after an appeals court ruled that California's law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition can remain in place.

        "content": "CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador as part of a secretive operation last week that has triggered a legal standoff in the U.S. and a debate around the world.\n\nOn March 15, the U.S. government deported 238 male Venezuelan citizens on three flights to El Salvador, accusing them of being part of a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua, which President Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.\n\nUpon landing, the deported men were forcefully led off planes by heavily armed Salvadoran authorities. They were marched into armored vehicles, had their heads shaved and were transferred into cells inside El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison, known as CECOT.\n\nThe high-profile deportations quickly set off a legal battle in the U.S. The court fight initially centered on the legality of Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel many of the Venezuelan deportees. It has since expanded into a showdown over whether the Trump administration knowingly defied a federal judge's order to halt deportations under the wartime law and turn the flights around.\n\nU.S. officials have said 137 of the Venezuelan men were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.\n\nBeyond that, the U.S. government has provided scant details about the deportations and has not publicly released the names of those sent to El Salvador. Family members and lawyers of deportees have said they only learned their loved ones or clients had been deported to the small Central American country through videos and photos posted by the Salvadoran government and news outlets.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it verified that all the Venezuelan deportees have connections to Tren de Aragua, but those accusations have been denied by relatives of some of those who were deported. The U.S. government has said in a court declaration that while some of those expelled have criminal histories in the U.S., \"many\" do not.\n\nCBS News is publishing the U.S. government's list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan deportees sent to El Salvador below. How long they will remain imprisoned in El Salvador and whether their family members and lawyers will be allowed to communicate with them remain open questions.\n\nCBS News reached out to DHS and the State Department for comment on the list.\n\nThe names of Venezuelans deported to El Salvador\n\nAgelviz Sanguino , Widmer Josneyder\n\n, Widmer Josneyder Aguilar Rodriguez , Nolberto Rafael\n\n,

        "content": "What's next for the Education Department after Trump orders its closure\n\nWashington — President Trump announced the signing of an executive order that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\"\n\n\"We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,\" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, \"We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.\"\n\nThe U.S. spends \"more money per pupil, yet we rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nHe claimed that 70% of eighth graders \"are not proficient in either reading or math,\" and \"40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.\" The president said that the administration would be returning education \"back to the states, where it belongs.\"\n\nPresident Trump stands with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon after signing an executive order to reduce the size and scope of the Education Department during a ceremony at the White House on March 20, 2025. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nAfter he signed the executive order, flanked by schoolchildren at desks on either side of him, the president held it up and invited Education Secretary Linda McMahon to stand with him on stage. Several Republican governors were on hand for the signing, too, including Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Braun of Indiana, Gregg Abbott of Texas and Kim Reynolds of Iowa.\n\nIn the two months since Mr. Trump took office, the Education Department's staff has already been slashed in half, and the administration is making plans to transfer some of its functions to other departments.\n\nDespite the president's rhetoric, fully eliminating the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. To advance most legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes, meaning seven Democrats would need to vote for it along with all Republicans.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge that he'll need the backing of some Democratic lawmakers: \"I hope they're going to be voting for it because ultimately, it may come before them.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday on Fox News, ahead of the signing, that the Education Department would be much smaller than it is currently.\n\nA White House official told CBS News on Wednesday that the following services will not be affected by the order: Student loans, Pell grants and Title I, which provides financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\nA White House official said Thursday that student loans, IDEA enforcement, and enforcing civil rights laws will remain at a smaller Education Department \"for now,\" but they will eventually be transferred to other departments.\n\nUpon naming Linda McMahon as education secretary, Mr. Trump said he wanted her to \"put herself out of a job.\" After she was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month, she sent a letter to the department titled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" saying Mr. Trump had \"tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education — a momentous final mission — quickly and responsibly.\"\n\nMr. Trump said Thursday that \"hopefully she will be the last secretary of education.\"\n\nNearly two dozen Democratic attorneys general last week filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt its efforts to slash the Education Department's workforce, calling it unconstitutional.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "About 10% of Americans say they have chronic insomnia, and millions of others report poor sleep quality. Ongoing research has found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems, including heart disease.\n\nDr. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, neuroscience and public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine. He discusses the need for sleep, why teenagers require more sleep than adults, and how you can get a good night's sleep without medications.\n\nThe Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion that have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nHow much sleep is enough for adults and for adolescents?\n\nJulio Fernandez-Mendoza: Adults who report getting about seven to eight hours of sleep per night generally have the best health, in terms of both physical and mental health, and longevity.\n\nBut that recommendation changes with age. Adults over age 65 may need just six to seven hours of sleep per night. So older people, if otherwise healthy, should not feel anxious if they're getting just six hours. Young people need the most – at least nine hours – and some younger children may need more.\n\nHow can insufficient sleep harm our health?\n\nFernandez-Mendoza: Our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia – difficulty falling or staying asleep – were more likely to have high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease.\n\nIn both teens and adults, we found that insomnia and shortened sleep may lead to elevated stress, hormone levels and inflammation. These problems tend to show up before you develop heart disease.\n\nAs we age, the recommended amount of sleep declines. National Sleep Foundation\n\nWhat about people who have more serious sleep problems?\n\nFernandez-Mendoza: Good sleep hygiene habits include cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, quitting smoking and exercising regularly. I also recommend not skipping meals, not eating too late at night and not eating too much.\n\nBut people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes. Research studies point to a set of six rules that can improve your sleep. You can follow these changes consistently in the short term, and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road.\n\nFirst, get up at the same time no matter what. No matter how much sleep you get. This will anchor your sleep/wake cycle, called your circadian rhythm.\n\nSecond, do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity.\n\nThird, when you can't sleep, don't lie in bed awake. Instead, get out of bed, go into another room if you can, and do an activity that's enjoyable or relaxing. Go back to bed only when you're ready to sleep.\n\nFourth, get going with daily activities even after a poor night's sleep. Don't try to compensate for sleep loss. If you have chronic insomnia, don't nap, sleep in, or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night.\n\nFifth, go to bed only when you're actually sleepy enough to fall asleep.\n\nAnd sixth, start with the amount of sleep you're now getting – with the lowest limit at five hours – and then increase it weekly by 15 minutes.\n\nThese six rules are evidence-based and go above and beyond simple sleep hygiene habits. If they don't work, see a provider who can help you.\n\nDo you have advice specifically for adolescents?\n\nFernandez-Mendoza: Adolescence is a unique developmental period. It's not just the obvious physical, emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty – there are changes in a teenager's brain that can alter their sleep patterns.\n\nWhen an adolescent goes through puberty, their internal clock changes so that their sleep schedule shifts to later hours. While it's true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships, there's also biology behind why they want to stay up late – their internal clocks have shifted. It's not just choice.\n\nSchool start times for most adolescents are at odds with that biological shift. So they don't get enough sleep, which affects their performance in school. Research suggests that schools with later start times are more closely aligned with the science on child development and don't put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to.\n\nParents can help their teens get better sleep. Set a time for kids to stop doing homework and put away electronics. Instead, they can watch TV with the family or read – something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed.\n\nYou can also gradually move back their wake-up time. Start on weekends, waking them up 30 minutes earlier every day, including school days, until the child reaches the desired wake-up time. Don't try to reshift them suddenly – for example, waking up a teenager at 5 a.m. like it's the military – because that doesn't work. They won't get used to it, since it's at odds with their internal clock. So, do it little by little. If that doesn't work, see a clinical provider.\n\nWhat kind of treatments can a sleep clinician provide?\n\nFernandez-Mendoza: People should get help if they feel they sleep poorly, if they're fatigued during the day, or if they snore or grind their teeth. All these issues deserve attention.\n\nSome people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication, but that's not true. There are behavioral, non-drug-based treatments that work. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment recommended for insomnia. Light therapy may also help, which is the use of a bright light therapy lamp at a given time during the day or evening, depending on the person's sleep problem.\n\nWatch the full interview to hear more.\n\nSciLine is a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit that helps journalists include scientific evidence and experts in their news stories.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

        "content": "London's Heathrow Airport — one of the busiest airports in the world — was closed on Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. An estimated 200,000 travelers could be affected.\n\nThe airport said the fire at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a \"significant power outage.\"\n\n\"To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until (11:59 p.m. Friday local time),\" a post on the airport's X account said. \"Passengers are advised not to travel to the airport.\"\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said there was \"currently no indication of foul play,\" but that counterterrorism police would be leading the investigation into the blaze.\n\n\"Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,\" the police said in a statement.\n\nTracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport. British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the \"next 24 hours and beyond.\"\n\nFire, which wiped out power and closed Heathrow Airport, rises at the North Hyde Electricity Substation in Hayes, Britain in this handout picture released on March 21, 2025. London Fire Brigade via REUTERS\n\nThe FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week.\n\n\"I saw the time on the screen started to increase,\" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner network BBC News. \"I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'\"\n\nDunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.\n\nThe impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands passengers forced to find alternate travel plans.\n\n\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shutdown European airspace.\n\n\"Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,\" Strickland told the AP.\n\nBritain's National Rail service canceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police.\n\nFirefighters douse the remainder of a fire that broke out at a substation supplying power to Heathrow Airport in Hayes, west London on March 21, 2025. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"\n\nThe fire was \"producing a significant amount of smoke. Please keep your windows and doors closed and avoid the area where possible,\" the brigade urged people in the area.\n\nThe power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.\n\nScottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a post on X that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes.\n\nAuthorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but U.K. Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband told LBC Radio there was no immediate suggestion of foul play. Local residents reported hearing explosions.\n\n\"I was about 100 yards from the explosion,\" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when \"suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook.\"\n\n\"When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,\" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house.\n\n\"When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook,\" Kapur said.\n\n\"There's obviously been a catastrophic fire at this substation,\" Miliband told the BBC, and \"it appears to have knocked out a back-up generator as well as a substation itself.\"\n\n\"We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,\" he said.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement Friday that he \"know(s) the situation in Heathrow is causing distress and disruption, especially for those traveling or without power in their homes. I'm receiving regular updates and I'm in close contact with partners on the ground,\" Starmer said. \"Thanks to our emergency workers for keeping people safe.\"\n\nThe latest numbers from travel data provider OAG Aviation show Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world. Earlier this year, it reported its busiest January on record, serving over 6.3 million passengers and averaging over 200,000 passengers a day. More than 1.2 million of those passengers travelled between the U.K. and the U.S.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

CBS News has learned that a barber from Venezuela was among those on the list for the deportation flights even though documents show he has no criminal record.\n\nFranco José Caraballo Tiapa, 26, is from Venezuela and entered the U.S. in 2023, requesting asylum from persecution back home.\n\nIn February, at a routine check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Texas, he was unexpectedly detained, and on Saturday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, says she lost contact with him. CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador, and Caraballo's name is on the list.\n\nA document from the Department of Homeland Security shows Caraballo is accused of being a member of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua but also specifies that he has no criminal history in the U.S. Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.\n\n\"He was not given due process,\" attorney Martin Rosenow said. \"He was not able to defend this allegation.\"\n\nThe DHS document lists Caraballo's tattoos but doesn't explicitly say they're connected to gang activity.\n\nThe Trump administration alleges that the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison over the weekend all had gang affiliations. In a sworn declaration Monday night, an ICE official said the agency \"carefully vetted each\" migrant deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act \"to ensure they were in fact members of TdA (Tren de Aragua).\" The official says \"many\" do not have criminal records, but some do.\n\nSánchez has been scouring images of the recent deportees trying to identify her husband.\n\nAsked what worries her about him being in this prison, Sánchez said that he's innocent.\n\nCBS News was inside CECOT last month, a place notorious for being an information dead zone. There's no cell signal, no visitors and the inmates are locked up for life despite many not being convicted yet.\n\n\"I'm concerned that we have no access,\" Rosenow said. \"Who has custody over our client? Who has jurisdiction? El Salvador? ICE? The U.S. government? We have no idea.\"\n\nSánchez's only hope is that both El Salvador and the U.S. show mercy in the name of justice.\n\n\"Just because of being Venezuelans, they can't judge us all for being criminals,\" Sánchez said in Spanish.\n\nDHS told CBS News it is confident in its intel and is following the law but didn't respond when asked about Caraballo's case.\n\nCaraballo's attorney fears that U.S. courts have lost jurisdiction. Salvadoran officials said they won't share any more information about the deportees.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "A jury has found two men guilty on all counts of trying to kill Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad, who works as a journalist and lives in New York City.\n\nRafat Amirov and Polad Omaroy, both allegedly members of the Russian mob, will be sentenced in September and are facing decades behind bars. The charges against them included murder for hire, firearms possession and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\n\"I am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran. I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished,\" Alinejad said outside court.\n\n\"‏Right now, I am bombarded with emotions. I have cried, I have laughed, I have even danced. Because today is not just about my survival; it is about the defeat and humiliation of a regime that believes it can silence its critics with bullets. They failed. I am still here. And I will keep fighting until every criminal in that regime faces their reckoning,\" she added.\n\nHow the verdict came down\n\nThe jury got the case just before 1 p.m. Thursday and later sent a note asking for testimony, but it was taking attorneys a while to gather materials. Before the jury even got the requested material, they sent another note saying they had reached a verdict.\n\nProsecutors told jurors during closing arguments the government of Iran put a $500,000 bounty on the head of Alinejad, who lives in Brooklyn, to silence her, and that she has been the target of several plots by the Islamic Republic of Iran, including kidnapping.\n\nThe man who said he was hired to kill her was arrested in 2022 and testified during the trial.\n\nWho is Masih Alinejad?\n\nAlinejad said she left the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2009 after they took her passport and made her sign an agreement that she would not cover the election there. She moved to the U.S. and covered it from here.\n\nAlinejad, who was a contributor for Voice of America, took the stand on Tuesday and was asked if the regime made accusations against her because of that contract.\n\nShe told the court, \"I've been accused of being an agent of the CIA,\" MI6 and President Trump, among other things.\n\nIn 2022, she was involved in two campaigns: boycotting Iranian sporting events, and a day of action calling on women in Iran to remove their hijab.\n\nShe told the court, \"My social media is like my weapon.\" She said her accounts were a place where she posted videos women sent her from Iran of themselves walking unveiled and getting harassed by the morality police.\n\nThat same year, prosecutors say there was a plot by Iran's government to assassinate her.\n\nThe man who took a plea deal and testified for the government said he was in the Russian mob and was hired to kill Alinejad. He took pictures and videos inside her home and was arrested nearby for rolling past a stop sign. An AK-47 was in his backseat.\n\nAlinejad described seeing him talking on a phone one day outside her home.\n\n\"I saw the big guy,\" she said. \"He was gigantic.\"",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nInvesting in gold now could be a smart way to build long-term wealth. Getty Images\n\nThe price of gold recently hit its apex, coming in at $3,000 per ounce. As economic uncertainty and political tensions have increased, so has the interest in gold investing. Thanks to the new gold price record, some investors have jumped on board looking for short-term gains.\n\nHowever, while gold may be a solid short-term investment right now, it has typically been a long-term investment. We spoke with gold experts about how the advantages of gold can help build long-term wealth. Below, we'll break down five to consider right now.\n\nStart protecting your investments with gold here now.\n\n5 advantages of using gold to build long-term wealth\n\nNot sure if a gold investment makes long-term sense for you? Here are five reasons why it could be a smart move:\n\nGold has widespread value\n\nGold didn't just recently become a beneficial asset. It has widespread value that transcends borders and cultures. Gold has been used in various ways throughout history to the present day, from gold coins as currency to electronics to jewelry. Its versatility and limited supply continue to cement the value of gold.\n\n\"Gold is a borderless asset. It is not dependent on a single type of investor, so to speak, because it has a broad-based demand,\" says Alex Ebkarian, COO and co-founder of Los Angeles-based precious metals dealer, Allegiance Gold.\n\nStart benefiting from a gold investment here now.\n\nGold maintains value and hedges against inflation\n\nWidespread and stubborn inflation has been pervasive over the last few years as the value of the dollar dwindles. To illustrate, $100 in February 2020 has the same buying power as $123.35 as of February 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI Inflation Calculator. That represents about a 23% cumulative increase in prices over the last five years.\n\nAs everything continues to be more expensive due to inflation, people are looking for ways to preserve value. That's where gold comes in.\n\n\"Gold can help you build wealth in several ways due to its unique characteristics as a store of value, as a hedge against inflation and as a diversification tool/strategy,\" says Paul Williams, managing director at Solomon Global and a specialist in the supply of physical gold bars and coins. \"It has a proven track record of maintaining its purchasing power over time, particularly during periods of high inflation. Historically, as inflation has risen, gold prices have also increased and protected wealth and spending power from erosion.\"\n\nGold provides diversification\n\nTo build long-term wealth, you want to put your money in various asset classes. While you might already have funds invested in the stock market, adding gold can provide further diversification with some unique benefits.\n\n\"Gold is a hard asset and it resists inflation nicely. It's also one of the few investments in the world that also functions as a currency and carries no counterparty risk, as long as you store it at home,\" says Brett Elliott, the director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX).\n\nGold investing can balance out some of the risks with stocks and bonds. Investing in gold assets can diversify your portfolio because when there is market volatility, gold typically holds its own as it historically has a low correlation with stocks and bonds.\n\nGold is a safe-haven asset\n\nInvestors have a lot of questions but not many answers right now. When will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates? How will tariffs affect the stock market and prices?\n\nWhen uncertainty abounds, many turn to gold as a safe-haven asset. Gold has often been seen as a way to ride out any economic storms and market volatility, as it holds its value. Gold investors can build long-term wealth by using gold as an anchor when facing economic headwinds.\n\nGold investments offer versatility\n\nYou don't necessarily need to buy gold bars and coins if you want to add gold to your portfolio. Various gold investment types are worth exploring, ranging from gold ETFs to gold IRAs and more. Like with any investment, the more you put in, the more you plant the seeds for long-term wealth.\n\n\"You can use gold to build long-term wealth by purchasing mutual fund shares in a gold and special minerals fund. Investing weekly or monthly an affordable amount continuously over a period of time can help provide long-term growth,\" says Mark Charnet, founder and CEO of American Prosperity Group, a financial planning group.\n\nDepending on your risk tolerance, goals and time horizon, you can choose a gold investment that aligns with your needs.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nInvesting is one of the primary ways to build long-term wealth. Adding gold to your portfolio can help you reach your goals by maintaining its value despite inflation and market volatility. If you're interested in gold or precious metal investing, it's important to understand the risks as well.\n\n\"While gold is a strong asset for diversification, it's important to be mindful of potential risks. A recession could reduce demand and lower inflation, which might cause the price of gold to stagnate or decline. Investors should weigh this risk when considering gold as part of their portfolio,\" suggests David Weild IV, chairman at Dignity Gold, a blockchain development company.\n\nBefore you get started, do your research and determine your goals. Look into the different types of gold investments to choose the right option for you.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "What's next for the Education Department after Trump orders its closure\n\nPresident Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.\n\nThe Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.\n\n\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"\n\nAhead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" For now, the agency will retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants, she added.\n\nBut Trump administration officials have said such programs will eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or Small Business Administration.\n\n\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them — we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"\n\nDespite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress — a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.\n\n\"Recipe for chaos\"\n\nDespite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that the White House hasn't released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks or specified which department would inherit its duties.\n\n\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"\n\nGranville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"\n\nThe Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.\n\n\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.\n\nShe points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.\n\nThat could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.\n\n\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.\n\n\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

The animals are protected in Colorado, but in large parts of Wyoming it's legal to kill them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services responded to reports of a predator killing five sheep in north-central Wyoming on Saturday. The agency found evidence pointing to a wolf attack, including bite marks and tracks, according to spokesperson Tanya Espinosa.\n\nLater that day, the agency killed the wolf it believed was the culprit and discovered it had a collar from Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Espinosa said. The wolf and collar were returned to the Colorado agency.\n\nThat agency said in a press release that a collar on a male gray wolf alerted the animal's death on Sunday in the same region of Wyoming. \"Wolves are known to travel long distances to find food or mates, including into other states,\" read the agency's statement.\n\nThe agency said the wolf had been transported from Canada, part of Colorado's ongoing reintroduction efforts after the first wolf paws touched down in December 2023. Coloradans voted for the wolf reintroduction measure back in 2020.\n\nIn January, wildlife officials confirmed the release of 15 new wolves from British Columbia in Colorado, CBS News Colorado reported.\n\nTwo of 10 wolves released in 2023 were illegally shot, the station reported. Officials warned that the Gray Wolf population in Colorado is protected by the federal Endangered Species Act and state law, and penalties fcan include fines up to $100,000, jail time and loss of hunting privileges.",

        "title": "Judge calls DOJ filing \"woefully insufficient\" in legal standoff over deportation flights",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — A federal judge on Thursday said the Justice Department \"evaded its obligations\" with a \"woefully insufficient\" response to his demand for more information about deportation flights that are at the center of a growing legal stand-off between the Trump administration and the courts.\n\nJudge James Boasberg, the chief judge in the federal district court in Washington, D.C., demanded on Saturday that two deportation flights turn around in midair and return to the U.S. — an order the Trump administration did not follow, saying the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.\n\nThe flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, with the government relying on a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from invoking that authority on Saturday.\n\nIn response to the government's failure to comply with his order, Boasberg directed the government to answer a number of questions regarding the flights, including what time the two planes departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time they left U.S. airspace, when they landed and when the deportees were transferred out of U.S. custody.\n\nBoasberg gave government attorneys a deadline of noon on Thursday to respond. The judge wrote in an order later in the afternoon that the government's response was filed after the deadline and featured only the sworn declaration of an acting ICE official who did not provide any new information in the case.\n\n\"This is woefully insufficient,\" Boasberg wrote.\n\nIn his order Saturday, Boasberg blocked not just the deportation of the plaintiffs, but of all potential deportees under the Alien Enemies Act. That order set off a back-and-forth between the judge and the Justice Department over whether the administration knowingly defied his directive to halt the deportations and turn the planes around.\n\nOn Thursday, the judge ordered the government to brief him by next Tuesday on why the failure to return the planes to the U.S. did not violate his temporary restraining order. He also demanded a declaration from \"an official with direct involvement\" in Cabinet-level discussions over invoking a legal mechanism known as the state secrets privilege. Boasberg set a deadline of 10 a.m. Friday for that declaration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke the state secrets privilege as justification for withholding information about the flights from Boasberg. A Justice Department spokesperson said the agency \"continues to believe that the court's superfluous questioning of sensitive national security information is inappropriate judicial overreach.\"\n\nWhile the government has not provided Boasberg with the details he has requested, CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador as part of the secretive operation on Saturday. The men were taken to a notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\nIn a sworn statement submitted to Boasberg on Thursday, an immigration attorney told the court that one of the deported men is a professional soccer player in Venezuela with no criminal history who was falsely linked to Tren de Aragua. The attorney argued that the man, Jerce Reyes Barrios, was accused of being connected to the gang in part because of a tattoo on his arm. The attorney said the tattoo was based on the logo for the Real Madrid football club.\n\nOther court filings challenging the deportations allege troubling conditions during last weekend's flights and preparations. Plaintiffs' attorneys argued there was \"chaos on the plane,\" \"taunting\" from officers, dangerous heat on board on tarmac, \"crying and frightened\" deportees and media prestaged to chronicle their arrival and departure.",

        "content": "Former University of Michigan quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss is facing 24 cybercrime charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nThe charges come more than two years after Weiss was fired in January 2023 amid an investigation by university police into possible computer-access crimes at a football building.\n\nWeiss, 42, is charged with 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\nOfficials allege that between 2015 and January 2023, Weiss hacked student-athlete databases of more than 100 colleges that were held by a third-party vendor. Once he gained access to the databases, Weiss allegedly downloaded \"personally identifiable information and medical data of more than 150,000 athletes.\"\n\nWeiss is accused of primarily targeting female student-athletes.\n\nAccording to criminal records, Weiss \"researched and targeted these women based on their school affiliation, athletic history, and physical characteristics. His goal was to obtain private photographs and videos never intended to be shared beyond intimate partners.\"\n\nThrough the information that he obtained from the databases and his research, Weiss allegedly gained access to email and social media accounts as well as cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 student-athletes. He's also accused of illegally obtaining the same information of more than 1,300 additional students and alumni from colleges across the U.S.\n\nAfter obtaining access to the accounts, Weiss reportedly downloaded personal and intimate pictures and videos that were not meant to be shared publicly, officials say.\n\n\"Our office will move aggressively to prosecute computer hacking to protect the private accounts of our citizens,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in a news release. \"We stand ready with our law enforcement partners to bring those who illegally invade the privacy of others to justice.\"\n\nIf convicted, Weiss faces up to five years in prison on each count of unauthorized access to computers and two years on each count of aggravated identity theft. Weiss faces a mandatory two-year sentence if convicted of aggravated identity theft.\n\n\"Today's indictment of Matthew Weiss underscores the commitment and meticulous investigative efforts of our law enforcement professionals,\" said Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan. \"The FBI Detroit Cyber Task Force, in close collaboration with the University of Michigan Police Department, worked relentlessly on this case to safeguard and protect our community.\"\n\nWeiss served as Michigan's quarterbacks coach in 2021 and as their co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach during the 2022 season. Before his time in Ann Arbor, Weiss was on the Baltimore Ravens coaching staff from 2009-2020.\n\nCBS News Detroit has reached out to the University of Michigan for comment and is waiting to hear back.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Grand Prairie, Texas — Joseph Buentello, 80, was cruising through retirement when he received a call erroneously claiming his son was in jail.\n\n\"I was scared, I hit the panic button and I let my panic take control of my good judgment,\" Buentello, of Grand Prairie, Texas, told CBS News.\n\nThe caller told Buentello that if he wanted to get his son out, he needed to rush to his local grocery store and send $5,000 through a bitcoin ATM.\n\nBuentello said he never even thought about calling his son first.\n\n\"They said there is nothing we can do about it,\" said Buentello the ATM operator told him after he was scammed. \"That money has already been distributed. They said it was distributed the minute you got through putting your money in there.\"\n\nThat is why, Buentello learned, the cryptocurrency scammers wanted him to use that machine. Often found inside convenience stores, Bitcoin ATMs resemble regular ATMs and provide a legitimate and straightforward method to convert cash into cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Trade Commission, between 2020 to 2023, consumer losses in bitcoin ATM scams skyrocketed nearly tenfold, from $12 million annually in 2020 to $114 million annually in 2023. During that timeframe, consumers over the age of 60 were more than three times more likely than younger adults to lose money to bitcoin scams, the FTC found.\n\nAnd getting the money back has been tough.\n\nWhen McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara first joined law enforcement back in 1970, he said the biggest thieves in the Texas county were bank robbers.\n\n\"Take a gun, go rob a bank, get the money, and we'd go after 'em,\" McNamara said. \"But this is a totally different deal now.\"\n\nA couple of years ago, after a caller scammed an 83-year-old woman in Waco, Texas, into depositing $15,000 into a bitcoin ATM, McNamara's deputies pulled the cash right out of the machine and returned it to her.\n\nThe bitcoin ATM operator then sued the county, claiming the seizure was unlawful, but the lawsuit was eventually dismissed and the woman was allowed to keep the money.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit was dismissed only after the county admitted that the funds were seized \"in error.\"\n\nMcNamara doesn't regret how the situation was handled.\n\n\n\n\"I don't regret it at all,\" McNamara said. \"We got the lady's money back. It should have gone back to her.\"\n\nBitcoin ATM operators told CBS News that they take extensive measures to protect users from fraud, including displaying up to six screens alerting customers to potential scams.\n\nIn recent years, a handful of states, including California, Vermont and Minnesota passed laws regulating Bitcoin ATMs. However, most of the country, including Texas, has no regulations.\n\n\"I feel like such a fool,\" Buentello said.\n\nHad there been any sort of refund policy in place when he made his transaction, Buentello believes could have saved his money and avoided the scam.\n\n\n\nAccording to the FTC, scammers will often offer an urgent reason for the victim to withdraw cash from their bank account and deposit it in a bitcoin ATM. They will provide a QR code that victims can scan, which deposits the money directly into the scammers' crypto account.\n\nSome tips from the FTC to avoid being scammed include never clinking on unknown links or responding directly to unexpected calls or unknown text messages. Scammers will be trying to rush you, so you should slow down and consult with someone you trust. And never withdraw cash in response to an unexpected call or message.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Tel Aviv — Israel's defense minister threatened earlier this week to open \"the gates of hell\" in Gaza if Hamas refuses to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demands, and Israel has been delivering. At least 58 people were killed in a third consecutive night of airstrikes up and down the Palestinian territory, bringing the death toll to an estimated 500 people since the ceasefire was shattered with Tuesday's shock pre-dawn Israeli missile barrages, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.\n\nMore than a dozen people were killed overnight in a strike on just one house, the home of the Mubarak family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They had gathered to mourn an earlier death. Survivors whisked the bodies of the dead to a hospital by ambulance and horse cart.\n\nThere were reports of fresh airstrikes early Thursday morning near Khan Younis and Rafah in the south of Gaza, near the border with Egypt.\n\nIsrael resumes ground operations in Gaza\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed Tuesday that it had also resumed ground operations in central Gaza, again dividing the strip into north and south along the Netzarim corridor and blocking movement across the line. The IDF said it was also stationing a brigade of troops in the south, while airdropping fliers warning civilians to evacuate from areas around the entire Gaza border, which it warned would be turned back into combat zones.\n\nA child looks on as people mourn Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes, at the European Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, March 20, 2025. Hatem Khaled/REUTERS\n\n\"The IDF does not intend to harm you,\" a post by the IDF spokesman for Arab Media said on X. \"For your safety it is forbidden to approach IDF forces in the defensive zone and in any place where they are deployed.\"\n\nThat message followed a severe threat from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to the citizens of Gaza.\n\n\"Residents of Gaza, this is a final warning,\" he said in a video broadcast Wednesday afternoon. \"If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not eliminated from Gaza Israel will act with forces you have never known before. Take the advice of the U.S. President. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you — including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation.\"\n\nIt appeared to be a threat of collective punishment against Gaza's civilian population for the actions of Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S.\n\nCollective punishment is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, though neither the U.S. nor Israel are signatories to that treaty.\n\nU.S. strikes Houthis as Yemeni rebels fire missiles at Israel, U.S. ships\n\nIsrael's renewed bombing of Gaza has drawn fierce condemnation from most of the country's Arab neighbors, and renewed efforts by Houthi militants in Yemen to target Israel and ships in the Red Sea with missiles.\n\nThe Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel.\n\n\"A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF (Israeli Air Force) prior to crossing into Israeli territory,\" the IDF said in a statement minutes after an all-clear was given. No damage was reported.\n\nThe Houthis also claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group and its warships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, but the U.S. military said there were no impacts.\n\nThe U.S. has responded to the Houthis' resumption of rocket launches with strikes against the group. Overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV. At least nine women and children were wounded in a residential neighborhood, a spokesperson for the Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry claimed in a post on X.\n\nPeople stand near buildings damaged by U.S. military strikes, in Sanaa, Yemen, March 20, 2025. Khaled Abdullah/REUTERS\n\nU.S. strikes also hit targets in southern Yemen, in a province known to have Houthi military sites and weapons warehouses.\n\nPresident Trump had threatened on his Truth Social media platform that the group would \"be completely annihilated.\"\n\nThursday morning, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X that American \"forces continue 24/7 operations against the Iran-backed Houthis,\" sharing undated videos of U.S. fighter jets taking off from an aircraft carrier.\n\nAt least 31 people have been killed in Yemen by the U.S. airstrikes, according to Yemeni media reports.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, CENTCOM said the Houthis had seized control of a World Food Program warehouse in the northern Yemeni city of Saada containing over 5,700,000 pounds of food and other humanitarian aid intended for civilians.\n\n\"This is another example of the Houthi's complete and reckless disregard for the people of Yemen and aggression toward the humanitarian operations that help those in need,\" CENTCOM said. \"The Houthis continue to violate international humanitarian law, as well as put aid workers and the Yemini people at risk. The Houthis care nothing for the Yemeni people.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article previously cited a leaflet dropped by Israeli forces in Gaza, but CBS News understands that leaflet was dropped in January, not this week.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "A Florida man who killed an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother on a night in which he drank heavily and used drugs was executed Thursday evening.\n\nPrison officials said Edward James, 63, was pronounced dead at 8:15 p.m. after receiving a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He drew the death penalty after pleading guilty to the Sept. 19, 1993, killings of Toni Neuner, 8, and her grandmother, Betty Dick, 58.\n\nAs he awaited the injection, James said he did not wish to give a final statement. Then, as the drugs were administered, James breathed heavily, his arms flinching and then he was still.\n\nThree other executions were carried out this week in the U.S., including the lethal injection earlier Thursday of an Oklahoma man for the fatal shooting of a woman during a home invasion. Arizona executed a man by an injection Wednesday and Louisiana used nitrogen gas for the first time Tuesday, putting a man to death as that state ended a 15-year pause on executions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court denied James' final appeals earlier in the day, clearing the way for the state's second execution of the year. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed James' death warrant earlier this year and another warrant for an execution in early April.\n\nJames had been renting a room in Dick's house in Casselberry, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Orlando, where Toni Neuner and three other children were staying the night of the attack.\n\nCourt records show James drank up to 24 beers at a party, downed some gin and also took LSD before returning to his room at Dick's house. The girl was raped and strangled to death. The other children were not harmed.\n\nJames, who pleaded guilty to the charges, was also convicted of the girl's rape and of stealing Dick's jewelry and car after stabbing her 21 times. Court documents show James drove the car across the country, occasionally selling pieces of jewelry until he was arrested on Oct. 6 of that year in Bakersfield, California.\n\nPolice obtained a videotaped confession from James, who despite his guilty pleas was sentenced to death upon an 11-1 recommendation by a jury.\n\nJames' lawyers had filed several appeals with state and federal courts, all of which were denied. Most recently, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an argument that his longtime use of drugs and alcohol, several head injuries and a heart attack in 2023 led to a mental decline that would make executing him cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe justices instead agreed with a lower court decision that \"James's cognitive issues do not shield him from execution.\" The court also rejected an argument from James' lawyers that a heart attack he suffered in prison led to oxygen deprivation that affected his brain and should have been considered as new evidence for halting plans to execute him.\n\nThe nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart.\n\nEarlier this year, James Ford was executed for the 1997 killings of a couple in Charlotte County — witnessed by their toddler daughter, who survived.\n\nFlorida officials said they are next preparing for the scheduled April 8 execution of Michael Tanzi for the 2000 slaying of a woman in the Florida Keys.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe same day Vivian Jenna Wilson, Elon Musk’s estranged daughter, published her second-ever interview with a media outlet, the billionaire media mogul used his X platform to insinuate trans people are behind reports of attacks on Teslas.\n\nDuring her interview with Teen Vogue, Wilson said she doesn’t “give a f**k” about Musk, calling him a “pathetic man-child.”\n\n“I don’t give a f**k how much money anyone has,” Wilson told the publication. “I don’t. I really don’t. He owns Twitter. Okay.”\n\nThe 20-year-old said she often learns about Musk’s actions from the news, saying she should “probably post about this and denounce it, which I have done a few times.”\n\n“The Nazi salute sh*t was insane,” Wilson said in reference to Musk’s performance of a straight-armed salute during Donald Trump’s inauguration that he has denied was a Nazi gesture. “That sh*t was definitely a Nazi salute.”\n\nThis is hardly the first time that Wilson, who has not spoken to Musk since 2020, has called out the billionaire.\n\nIn July 2024, Musk took to his X platform to say that Wilson was “born gay and slightly autistic,” adding that, as a child, she would “pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was ‘fabulous!’” Three days later, Musk sat down with Jordan Peterson for a two-plus-hour live stream on X during which the media mogul claimed his “son” had been “killed” by “the woke mind virus.”\n\nMusk’s comments to Peterson effectively denied his daughter’s trans identity, reflecting his embrace of far-right politics, which often seek to crack down on transgender people’s rights and gender affirming care, and foreshadowed the politics he has pushed in his advisory role to Trump.\n\nCNN has reached out to Musk for comment.\n\nWilson took to Threads — X’s Meta-owned rival — the same day to call out Musk for spreading misinformation, saying that his July 2024 X post was “entirely fake” before adding “literally none of this ever happened.”\n\nElon Musk gestures at Capital One arena during President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. He has denied the straight-armed salute was a Nazi gesture. Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nLater that same day, NBC News published an exclusive interview with Wilson, who emphasized that Musk “was under the assumption that I wasn’t going to say anything and I would just let this go unchallenged.”\n\nIn the 12 hours since Wilson’s Teen Vogue interview published, the billionaire has alleged that New York will attempt to illegally usher in non-citizen voting and amplified a post claiming that 10,000 voters in Arizona used the same social security number to vote.\n\nMusk also repeatedly circulated posts connecting the reports of vandalism on Teslas to trans people.\n\n“What are the statistics on trans violence,” Musk asked in yet another X post on Thursday. “The probability of a trans person being violent appears to be vastly higher than non-trans. Hormone injections cause extreme emotional volatility. That is simply a fact.”\n\nMusk on Thursday also shared a clip from Fox News in which anchor Harris Faulkner posited a hypothetical in which a Tesla set on fire by vandals could result in a human death, asking White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt if that could merit the death penalty.\n\n“What I can tell you is that President Trump condemns this violence, and he is determined to restore law and order in our country, and he will ensure that the harshest penalties are pursued for those who are engaging in this vicious violence that we have seen targeted at this American company,” Leavitt said in response to Faulkner’s hypothetical scenario.\n\nA self-described “free speech absolutist,” Musk has also used X — which he acquired in October 2022 for $44 billion — to repeatedly attack immigrants and transgender people, and to spread an antisemitic conspiracy theory.\n\nWilson’s interview in Teen Vogue, which also explores her queerness, comes as Trump has made dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs a cornerstone of his new administration.\n\nMusk, a Trump ally, has not shied away from voicing his disapproval of DEI programs, calling it “just another word for racism” last year and saying that “DEI must DIE” in a December 2023 X post. And, under his supervision, the Department of Government Efficiency in February threatened to pull federal funding for public schools and universities that failed to end their DEI programs within two weeks.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nCoco Gauff had what she called a “great day” on Thursday as she beat her fellow American Sofia Kenin without dropping a game at the Miami Open.\n\nWorld No. 3 Gauff romped past Kenin with a 6-0, 6-0 scoreline – colloquially known as a double bagel – to reach the third round of the tournament.\n\nIt was a dramatic return to form for Gauff who, after beginning 2025 with nine wins in a row, has gone 3-4 in her last seven matches as she struggles to find consistency.\n\nAfter emphatically dispatching Kenin – Gauff has now won her last two matches against the 2020 Australian Open champion – the 21-year-old spoke about how she’s had to learn to have a “short-term memory when it comes to wins and losses.”\n\n“I was definitely playing well today, and maybe she wasn’t playing her peak great tennis,” the Florida-native said after her second-round victory at the Miami Open. “I don’t think anyone who is playing their best tennis will have that scoreline today, so I’m not going to sit here and say she played her best tennis.\n\n“I think it was a combination of me playing really well, it was really great tennis from me, and maybe her not playing as well.”\n\nGauff is playing in front of a friendly crowd at the Miami Open. Lynne Sladky/AP\n\nGauff has never made it past the fourth round at the Miami Open and will face world No.\n\n51 Maria Sakkari in the third round. It will be the second time in as many tournaments that Gauff as faced the Greek, having beaten her in straight sets at Indian Wells.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday at the Miami Open, there were emphatic wins for Aryna Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka and defending champion Danielle Collins who all safely booked their spots in the next round.\n\nHowever, Thursday also saw the shock of the tournament so far as world No. 40 Ashlyn Krueger upset seventh seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.\n\nKrueger had to withstand a remarkable 22-point winning run from Rybakina on her serve in the first set but grew into the match to record the biggest win of her career so far.\n\nIt was the first victory over a top-10 ranked player for Krueger, who has been given the nickname “Baby Rybakina” by fans due to her similarities to the Kazakhstani player; they are both tall and are renowned for big hits and powerful serves.\n\nKrueger recorded the best victory of her career so far as she beat Elena Rybakina at the Miami Open. Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nWhen that nickname was put to Krueger after the match, the American laughed and said she was unaware of it but admitted she saw the similarities in the pair’s games.\n\n“Big serves, big returns,” the 20-year-old said. “I knew there weren’t going to be a ton of long points. So a lot of serves, first balls – who was going to get on top of the point quicker.”\n\nKrueger will now face Leylah Fernandez in the third round of the Miami Open.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nNovak Djokovic has said that he agrees and disagrees with parts of the legal action taken by the Professional Tennis Players’ Association (PTPA), the players’ association he co-founded.\n\nEarlier this week, the PTPA filed suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the ATP and WTA Tours – the governing bodies of men’s and women’s tennis – as well as the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).\n\nThe suits allege the “monopolization” of men’s and women’s tennis and the “disregard” of player interests, accusing the governing organizations of operating “as a cartel.”\n\nAs well as in New York, the PTPA has said that it is also filing lawsuits in the European Union and United Kingdom. The wide-ranging legal action covers prize money, the rankings system and schedule, the investigative processes of the ITIA, and name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation, among other areas.\n\n“I’ve seen some changes, but there are some fundamental changes that are still yet to be made and I really hope that all the governing bodies, including PTPA, will come together and solve these issues,” 24-time grand slam singles champion Djokovic told reporters at the Miami Open on Thursday.\n\n“This is a classic lawsuit, so lawyers to lawyers type of situation. So to be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit, and then there are also things that I don’t agree with.”\n\nTwelve players – including PTPA co-founder Vasek Pospisil and 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios – are named as plaintiffs in the complaint filed in the US.\n\nDjokovic’s name is not included on the complaint, and he said on Thursday that he has previously been “very active in tennis politics” but didn’t sign because he “want(s) other players to step up.”\n\nThe world No. 5 added: “I’ve never been a fan and supporter of division in our sport, but I’ve always fought for better representation and influence of and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which I think is still not where it should be and where most of the players think it should be.\n\n“(That’s) not just in terms of prize money, but in terms of many other points that have been also stated in that document.”\n\nIn a news release, the PTPA claimed that the sport’s governing bodies exhibit a “disregard for players,” which includes forcing them to compete in 100-degree Fahrenheit heat, in matches that finish at 3 a.m., and with different “injury-inducing” tennis balls. It added that the 11-month-long season allows players little time to recover.\n\nThe PTPA also alleges that the tours “collude” to cap prize money, prevent new competitors and tournaments from entering the market, impose a “draconian” ranking points system, and award players no compensation from NIL rights.\n\nThe ATP and WTA both expressed their dissatisfaction with the lawsuits and said that they would defend their positions “vigorously.” The ITIA said that it is aware of the filings, while the ITF said that it would take time to consider an appropriate response.\n\nOn Wednesday, four-time grand slam champion Carlos Alcaraz said that he doesn’t support the PTPA’s lawsuit.\n\n“Yesterday, I saw on social media that they put something I said in a press conference in the documents and I wasn’t aware of it,” he told reporters. “I honestly don’t support that letter because I wasn’t aware of it.”\n\nDjokovic, winless in his past three singles matches, faces Australian Rinky Hijikata at the Miami Open on Friday, while Alcaraz plays Belgium’s David Goffin.",

He was trying to get more information.\n\nThose of us who were in business class were able to recline and get a bit of sleep, and we kept waiting and waiting for more information. The captain told us that we burned off fuel with the auxiliary power unit and we wouldn’t have enough to get to London anyway, so he topped up the tanks and then we waited a bit more.\n\nFinally, at 4 a.m. he told us the flight was canceled and that we would be bussed back.

        "title": "‘It’s not what he expected’: Rubio has competition for the role of America’s top diplomat",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nWhen Marco Rubio signed on as Donald Trump’s Secretary of State, he went into the job “with eyes wide open,” according to a person familiar with his thinking. He knew it wouldn’t be easy working for Trump. He knew that Trump had a track record of firing top officials by tweet. He also knew what it was like to be called, “Little Marco.”\n\nRubio still lobbied for the prestigious job of being America’s top diplomat after he lost out on being Trump’s vice president to JD Vance.\n\nWhat Rubio didn’t count on was that he might run the risk of being overshadowed as secretary of state by one of Trump’s closest friends, real estate developer and billionaire Steve Witkoff.\n\nOver the first two months of the second Trump administration, Rubio has in some ways taken a back seat on the world stage to Witkoff, whose portfolio has expanded beyond his official title of special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWitkoff has been a leading player in some of Trump’s highest profile foreign policy wins — the release of hostages in Israel, a since-broken ceasefire in Gaza, and the return of American Marc Fogel from Russia after Witkoff traveled to Moscow to finalize negotiations for his release.\n\nHe’s jetted around the Middle East and become a key mediator in talks to end the war in Ukraine. Witkoff went back to Moscow for a face-to-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to try to advance the administration’s ceasefire proposal.\n\nWitkoff is “flying all over the world playing secretary of state,” said a person familiar with the dynamic. “He has one thing that no one else has — he has Trump’s 100% confidence.”\n\nRubio, meanwhile, has dived into his role with trips to Central America to discuss immigration, to the Middle East, Europe and Canada for discussions on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and to meet with G7 partners.\n\nAt times, he has appeared uncomfortable with some of the administration’s moves: he reportedly feuded with Elon Musk in a Trump Cabinet meeting earlier this month, and was notably photographed in what one Rubio ally called a “couch slouch” in the Oval Office as Trump and Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe optics have raised questions about Rubio’s influence with Trump, according to people familiar with the State Department. Though Rubio was the first cabinet member confirmed— unanimously at that — his role has lacked some of the profile and portfolio traditionally enjoyed by previous secretaries of state. And there’s a contingent of MAGA faithful still skeptical of his hawkish foreign policy views.\n\n“I think he is frustrated,” a senator still in touch with Rubio told CNN.\n\nWhile foreign diplomats have praised Rubio for his engagement, multiple sources familiar with Rubio and the job say he appears ill at ease by how the White House has minimized his role.\n\n“It’s not what he expected,” said one person. “Witkoff came out of the blue,” they added. “Trump loves him.”\n\nNevertheless, only Rubio carries the full trappings of the secretary’s office. While Witkoff often flies on his own Gulfstream private jet, Rubio is welcomed with pomp upon arrival in foreign countries, traveling with a large security detail and on the government’s C-32 jumbo jet emblazoned with “United States of America.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Witkoff said he had a “wonderful working relationship” with Rubio.\n\n“He is already a great Secretary of State and in my view will go down as one of the greatest,” Witkoff said. “Where the media gets these nonsense stories I will never know so I have now learned to dismiss them. Every single issue I am working on comes with the collaboration of Marco Rubio.”\n\nRubio’s allies in the administration argue he and Witkoff are complementing each other rather than dueling, and both the State Department and the White House pushed back on the notion that he is in any way being overshadowed by Witkoff.\n\n“Nothing could be further from the truth,” National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN. “Secretary Rubio is a pivotal leader on President Trump’s national security team having spearheaded a number of foreign policy initiatives, especially as it relates to negotiating a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine and driving policy in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump has amassed a talented team who are working around the clock to deliver results for Americans.”\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement, “Your premise is false. Secretary Rubio and Special Envoy Witkoff have a fantastic relationship, and are working together to advance President Trump’s agenda.”\n\n‘Witkoff is a golf buddy’\n\nTrump’s public reliance on Witkoff has already led to speculation in Washington about how long Rubio will want to stay in the job.\n\nOne longtime friend of Rubio’s said he approached the job mindful of the revolving door of the first Trump administration, notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who lasted 13 months. Another person familiar with Rubio’s thinking said he took the job to “burnish his credentials” and still has presidential ambitions that were not reached after his 2016 bid fell short to Trump.\n\nHe will view his role as a success if he serves for 18 months to two years, the friend added, which would allow him time to plan for a potential presidential run in 2028, should that opportunity present itself.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio listens as President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSources familiar with Rubio also point out there is a potential upside for him keeping some of the biggest foreign policy crises at arms’ length, with major questions still looming about how Trump will navigate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the broken ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n“I think Marco will find his groove and his niche,” said a former Republican senator who worked with Rubio. “It probably won’t be with the hot-button areas of the world — and he’d probably be wise to leave that with the White House to deal with.”\n\nRubio built a lengthy foreign policy resume in the Senate, serving as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a long-term member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That experience helped him land on Trump’s VP shortlist, even though he was ultimately passed over for Vance.\n\nRubio has already played a key role in several diplomatic efforts. He led a US delegation to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, where Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposal, easing tensions with Kyiv after the Zelensky Oval Office blowup.\n\nFor some veteran diplomats back in Washington, it’s been tough watching Rubio’s first two months on the job — fighting cuts from Musk’s DOGE and ceding some of the traditional diplomatic role of the secretary of state to one of Trump’s New York real estate friends.\n\nWhile Rubio was tasked with soothing and reassuring America’s closest allies during last week’s formal G7 meeting in Quebec, Canada, Witkoff was headed to Moscow, for a one-on-one meeting with Putin.\n\n“Marco Rubio is a real foreign policy guy,” said one former senior State Department official familiar with both Rubio and Witkoff. “The idea that Steve Witkoff is going to sit around with Putin in the Kremlin, I mean really. Come on, Witkoff is a golf buddy… it’s ridiculous.”\n\n‘Rough times are for politicians’\n\nThe G7 meeting last week in Canada was the first real chance for Rubio to explain directly to counterparts the vision of the Trump agenda, a senior US official close to Rubio told CNN, emphasizing that it “isn’t a passing fad” but something that will “require everybody to adjust.”\n\nTrump didn’t make it easy for him.\n\nJust as Rubio was sitting down for a long day of meetings with frustrated allies, Trump sent out a caps-filled social media post announcing a new 200% tariff on European alcohol, targeting some of the countries whose ministers were with Rubio at the G7 meeting.\n\nAs the assembled diplomats shared Trump’s message with each other, they recognized the difficult position Rubio was in.\n\nHours later, Trump struck again, declaring from the Oval Office, “Canada only works as a state.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, second from right, attends the G7 foreign ministers meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, on March 13. Sébastien St-Jean/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 51st state question dogged Rubio throughout his trip to Canada. He answered like a diplomat: “There’s a disagreement between the president’s position and the position of the Canadian government,” Rubio told reporters. “I don’t think that’s a mystery coming in and it wasn’t a topic of conversation, because that’s not what the summit was about.”\n\nBoth in public and private, Rubio and other G7 officials emphasized a need to ignore the Trump-fueled chaos and focus on what they could try to move forward, like a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to sources who requested anonymity.\n\nTo some foreign diplomats at the G7, the ease of working with Rubio behind closed doors contrasted with the difficulties of dealing with the temperamental Trump White House.\n\nHe’s “a very valuable interlocutor,” one senior European official told CNN. “I don’t feel this hostility” that Trump expresses, the official added.\n\nIn the resort hotel that hosted the three-day G7 event, foreign officials privately expressed surprise and anger over Trump’s actions, though they roundly praised Rubio for his professional diplomacy.\n\n“He’s a pure politician with a very good pedigree,” said another senior European official who attended several of the G7 meetings with Rubio. “Rough times are for politicians.”\n\nInternational officials said that behind closed doors, Rubio did not stray from his public praise of Trump and desire to enact Trump’s agenda, however controversial.\n\n“He is a truly experienced diplomatic hand,” said a third foreign official.\n\nSeveral officials did however raise the question of how much influence Rubio has on Trump.\n\nFollowing the G7, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy flew to Washington where he met with Vance on Sunday, despite having just seen Rubio, his counterpart, in Canada.\n\nThe view from Foggy Bottom\n\nInside the State Department, Rubio is getting mixed reviews.\n\nThere have been scores of retirements of diplomats, sources told CNN, far more than in previous years. And because of the government-wide hiring freeze, the Department has stopped offering the foreign service exam and rescinded offers for an April entry-level class of foreign service officers.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio shakes hands with Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez during a tour at the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal in Panama City on February 2. March Schiefelbein/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, it seems that Rubio has been able to push back against some of DOGE’s biggest cuts, two foreign service officers said, noting that there has not yet been a widespread firing of State Department personnel.\n\nAlthough they do expect potentially “massive” reductions, “the effort to protect us from the most immediate and most sort of extreme cuts were good,” one of the foreign service officers said.\n\nStill, this person said they were disappointed Rubio hadn’t been more of a moderating influence.\n\n“The earliest signals were that there was going to be kind of a fight between the Rubio people and the Trump people. Rubio does not seem like he is interested or capable in fighting back on policy issues,” the officer said, pointing to “the utter abandonment of Ukraine.”\n\n“It’s unconscionable what he has done to Ukraine,” the person added.\n\n‘Up until 3am’\n\nAnother challenge Rubio has faced is Trump’s sweeping suspension of foreign aid. He is now in charge of a dismantled USAID, whose mission he long supported as a senator.\n\nRubio has spent long hours trying to work through lists of waiver requests for critical programs, according to the senator who’s stayed in touch with Rubio.\n\n“I talked to him a couple weeks in, when all the first USAID things were happening, and he said he’d been up until 3 am trying to go through waivers,” the senator said.\n\n“He expressed concern about waivers for programs that are important for humanitarian reasons in terms of our national security, but that has not translated into having those programs turned back on by a large degree,” the senator added.\n\nIn the end, however, it was Rubio himself who sent the memo putting in place the foreign aid freeze with waivers only for life-saving programs.",

Creighton shot over 55% from the field, including 45% from beyond the arc. The double-double for Neal – 29 points, 11 rebounds – made the Arizona State transfer the standout player of the game.\n\nChucky Hepburn of Louisville led the Cardinals with 22 points.\n\nPurdue 75, High Point 63\n\nIt looked for a while that High Point could cause an upset but they couldn’t quite hang with No. 4 seed Purdue in the end.\n\nThe Boilermakers pulled away late and were paced by Trey Kaufman-Renn’s 21 points and Braden Smith’s 20 points.\n\nWisconsin 85, Montana 66\n\nNo. 14 Montana battled hard to keep the game close, but No. 3 Wisconsin showed its quality in the closing stages to secure a dominant 85-66 win in the first round of March Madness.\n\nJohn Blackwell impressed with a game-high 19 points for the Badgers to go with five rebounds, three assists and two steals. Steven Crowl added 18 points for Wisconsin and John Tonje had 15.\n\nJohn Blackwell of the Wisconsin Badgers shoots the ball over Kai Johnson of the Montana Grizzlies during the second half at Ball Arena. Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nHouston 78, SIUE 40\n\nHouston stormed to an impressive 78-40 blowout win being rewarded for getting its work done early and never allowed SIUE to get any form of momentum going throughout the game.\n\nKelvin Sampson’s team was impressive on both sides of the ball. Houston dominated the boards and recorded an impressive 11 steals as the Cougars hustled to the very end.\n\nAuburn 83, Alabama State 63\n\nAuburn is rolling on as the tournament’s top seed trounced Alabama State by a final score of 83-63.\n\nThe Tigers got a scare put into them during the first half when the Hornets pulled within one point of the SEC regular season champion, but Auburn collected itself and didn’t allow State to take the lead. The Tigers led by 10 at the half.\n\nAfter the break, it was all Tigers with Auburn cruising to a relatively easy win.\n\nMcNeese State 69, Clemson 67\n\nMcNeese State will face No. 4 Purdue on Saturday in the round of 32. Eric Canha/Imagn Images/Reuters\n\nAfter a nervy final five minutes, No. 12 McNeese State was able to hold onto a famous victory over No. 5 Clemson.\n\nThe Tigers made it an exciting finish in Rhode Island as their offense finally woke up – with Chase Hunter scoring all of his 21 points in the second half – but the deficit was too large as the Cowboys were able to hold on and advance to the second round for the first time.\n\nBrandon Murray led the way off the bench for McNeese State with 21 points, but it was the team’s defense that really stole the show, coming up with 13 turnovers and having six blocks.\n\nBYU 80, VCU 71\n\nBYU made it a little nervy in the final minute of the game as VCU cut the deficit to single digits but the Cougars were able to close it out to play Wisconsin on Saturday.\n\nRichie Saunders (16 points) and Igor Demin (15 points) starred for BYU.\n\nVCU made a valiant effort in the second half – outscoring BYU by two – but it wasn’t enough to overcome the feisty Cougars. Zeb Jackson, especially, can be proud of his performance, ending the game with five three-pointers and 23 points.\n\nGonzaga 89, Georgia 68\n\nGonzaga has stormed through to the March Madness round of 32 after an impressive win over Georgia.\n\nThe victory only seemed to be heading one way when the Zags raced to a huge early lead – Gonzaga started the game with an electric 27-3 run. While Georgia continued to toil away, Gonzaga’s offense proved to be too much for the Dawgs.\n\nTennessee 77, Wofford 62\n\nChaz Lanier scored 29 points to lead the Tennessee Volunteers to a wire-to-wire win over No. 15 Wofford.\n\nLanier nailed six 3-pointers, enabling the No. 2 seed Volunteers to keep the Terriers at arm’s length. Zakai Zeigler added 12 points and 12 assists in the 77-62 victory.\n\nArkansas 79, Kansas 72\n\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks shook off a shooting slump in the second half to sprint to a victory over the Kansas Jayhawks, an upset that puts an end to a disappointing campaign for Bill Self’s team.\n\nThe Razorbacks went on a 15-5 run in the final stretch to close out the game after Kansas threw its best punch to retake the lead after the Hogs had led for a long stretch.\n\nJonas Aidoo led Arkansas in scoring with 22 points.\n\nTexas A&M 80, Yale 71\n\nThe No. 4-seed Texas A&M Aggies took down the No. 13-seed Yale Bulldogs 80-71 in their first round game in Denver.\n\nAfter Yale shocked the world as a 13-seed last season with a win over 4-seed Auburn, the Aggies were not about to fall into the same trap that snared their SEC comrades in 2024.\n\nA&M took command early in the contest and kept the Ivy League champs at arms’ length for the whole game.\n\nDrake 67, Missouri 57\n\nBennett Stirtz scored a game-high 21 points to help Drake upset Missouri. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nThe No. 11 Drake withstood a strong push from No. 6 Missouri in the second half and are now through to the second round.\n\nBennett Stirtz finished the game with 21 points as he led the way for the Bulldogs, who tallied their first win in the NCAA tournament’s round of 64 in program history.\n\nUCLA 72, Utah State 47\n\nNo. 7 UCLA cruised to a first round victory over No. 10 Utah State in the fourth and final game tonight in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nThe Bruins took advantage of a poor shooting night by the Aggies, who shot 30% from the field and missed 27 3-pointers in the 72-47 loss.\n\n“You can’t say enough about our guys’ effort,” UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said after the game.\n\nSt. John’s 83, Omaha 53\n\nChants of “Rick Pitino!” echoed around the arena in Providence as St. John’s put the finishing touches on a blowout win over Omaha.\n\nThe Red Storm put the hurt on Omaha in the second half, running away with a big 83-53 victory to get their March Madness run started.\n\nThe Mavericks made it interesting in the first half, but ultimately couldn’t keep up with the Johnnies once their shots started falling.\n\nMichigan 68, UC San Diego 65\n\nMichigan only just held off the University of California-San Diego’s upset bid as a missed three at the buzzer fell to the side, sending the Wolverines through to the next round.\n\nThe final score was 68-65 in favor of U-M.\n\nTexas Tech 82, UNC-Wilmington 72\n\nIt was probably a lot closer than they would’ve liked, but the Texas Tech Red Raiders are through to the round of 32 after defeating UNC Wilmington 82-72 in the final game of the day.\n\nKerwin Walton led the way for Texas Tech, scoring a game-high 27 points, while Elijah Hawkins flirted with a triple-double – 13 points, 10 assists, and nine boards.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN —\n\nDrawn by sunshine or a lower cost of living, a growing number of Americans are choosing to live their golden years outside the US, in the hope that it will better suit their financial or lifestyle needs and wants.\n\nWhile official numbers aren’t available, companies and organizations that specialize in assisting people move abroad have seen a massive post-election uptick in traffic and enquiries over the last few months — anecdotal evidence, some say, suggesting a “momentum, a movement taking shape” among Americans, including many retirees, seriously considering (or already undertaking) a permanent move abroad.\n\n“I don’t think (it’s) going to just dissipate the way it has in every previous election that I’ve been doing this,” Kathleen Peddicord, founder and publisher of Live and Invest Overseas, told CNN Travel. “I don’t think this is going to fade away. They’re asking pretty serious questions about this country versus this country, and ‘What would my residency options be, and what will my tax burdens be?’ So they’re not dreamy questions. They’re very practical.”\n\nEstablished in 2008, LIOS publishes regular content related to moving abroad, such as questions about taxes and health care. In the days following the election, web traffic was about 250% higher than normal, Peddicord says, and the sustained interest has helped fuel “the greatest growth in our readership in our history.”\n\nRetirees make up about 80% of the LIOS audience, including those who are already retired and those planning for it, Peddicord said, and its annual list of 10 Best Places to Retire is among the publication’s “most read and highly anticipated” reports.\n\nInternational Living, a monthly magazine and website that focuses on living abroad, has also seen a significant uptick in enquiries and traffic, which started even before the election, Executive Editor Jennifer Stevens tells CNN Travel. Its data-driven Annual Global Retirement Index is based on factors including housing, visas, cost of living and health care, as well as input from more than 200 on-the-ground editors and correspondents.\n\nAt the publication’s most recent annual conference, which was held in Las Vegas in October 2024, Stevens said she spoke to many readers, including retirees, about their growing concern over “Trump policies making living sort of uncomfortable in the US,” as well as the “social situation in the States” and the “economic implications of tariffs” under the new administration.\n\nAt the same time, Stevens said she also noticed a sense of excitement in others over the prospect of potential tax breaks and more expendable income — which could stretch even further outside of the US. “They’re looking for ways they can diversify internationally or spend some of that money abroad,” she says.\n\nMoney — or lack of it — continues to be a pressing issue for many retirees in the US. Skyrocketing costs for housing, rent and healthcare are siphoning away savings more quickly than in previous generations — in fact, almost half of US families have no retirement account savings.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 17 million Americans aged 65 or older — approximately one in three — are considered economically insecure (meaning they have income levels at 200% or more below the federal poverty level).\n\nMoving to a country with a much lower cost of living offers an opportunity to “invert your budget, so you could take what you’re currently spending on, say, transportation, and move to a place where you don’t need a car, for instance, and use that budget for discretionary spending,” Sophia Titley, LIOS editor-in-chief, tells CNN Travel.\n\nIn addition to their finances, which often are based on fixed budgets, retirees face a specific set of criteria to consider before making the leap abroad. First of all, there’s the issue of whether they are legally allowed — or have the means — to retire in their destination of choice. (For example, some countries may offer attractive employment options for digital nomads — but not so much for those who are no longer working.)\n\n“You need to look at places where you can reasonably get a residency visa,” Titley says. “I would say that’s the best place to start. Look at what you have, what you can afford, the different thresholds to qualify, and look at places that actually offer residency permits for everyday people.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to exit the country and not screw it up 02:00 - Source: CNN How to exit the country and not screw it up 02:00\n\nAnother key consideration: determining your eligibility and costs for health care and health insurance in a new destination. Experts recommend researching options thoroughly beforehand, as some countries, including Spain and France, require health insurance as a requirement for granting a visa.\n\nHowever, Peddicord notes that “the good news … is that wherever you go, the health care is going to be more affordable, because it’s more expensive in the United States than anywhere — not only health care, but also health insurance.”\n\nFinally, retirees who receive Medicare — the federal insurance program available to Americans aged 65 and older (and some younger individuals with disabilities) — should make sure to do their homework about what moving abroad means for their eligibility.\n\nExcept for a few situations, Medicare will not cover health care costs outside of the US; however, experts recommend keeping coverage if possible, which can offer a safety net and sense of reassurance in the event of a serious illness or injury.\n\n“It just keeps your options open,” Peddicord explains. “You can choose to go back to the States, where you may have family and more of a network of support for going through an experience like that, whereas, if you’ve given up your Medicare, it’s not a straightforward thing always to re-engage in the program.”\n\nWhile visas, taxes and healthcare are among the most important considerations for a move abroad, retirees also should consider destinations — and the smaller regions within those — that align with their preferred lifestyle.\n\nHere are five countries that are well-suited for retirees in 2025. (This list primarily targets retirees from the US, but it also contains helpful general information.)\n\nPanama\n\nPanama might just have \"the best retiree visa in the world,\" says International Living's Jennifer Stevens. imageBROKER.com/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThis Central American country topped International Living’s Annual Global Retirement Index as the world’s best retirement destination for 2025, fueled by its straightforward visa process, excellent quality of life and good value for money.\n\nPanama boasts “what is arguably the best retiree visa in the world,” Stevens explains. “They figured out, before almost anybody else, that if you made it easy for foreign retirees to come, they would happily come and spend their money in Panama. So Panama makes it very easy to get a visa and to renew that visa, and it gives you great benefits as a retiree.”\n\nThose benefits include discounts on airfare, the theater and more. Panama’s modern health care system also earns high marks — and in addition to lower costs for medical services, legal residents who are pensioner age (60 years for men, 55 for women) receive 20% off prescription medications.\n\nKey considerations: Panama has a fairly low threshold for its passive income requirement: a minimum monthly income of US $1,000 from a government program, such as Social Security, or a private corporation. That minimum goes up by $250 per month per dependent.\n\nEnglish proficiency levels are fairly low across the country, so it’s extremely helpful to have at least some grasp of Spanish.\n\nHow to make the move: The Embassy of Panama’s website clearly states in English on its website what’s needed to apply for a retiree visa, also known as the Pensionado Visa. Note that your application must be processed by a Panamanian attorney, and you’ll need to apply in Panama.\n\nFrance\n\nMany Americans are attracted to experiencing \"la vie en rose.\" Steve Smith/Tetra images RF/Getty Images\n\nFrance is famous for its fine dining, world-class museums and beautiful beaches and countryside. But francophiles who dream of spending their retirement years in this beloved European country can also take advantage of a more practical benefit: its top-notch health care system. Services are provided to all residents and largely subsidized by the government.\n\nIn addition, France’s affordability also comes as a surprise to some. According to Chase Buchanan’s latest data, rent for a family apartment in France can be as low as about $1,100 in cities other than Paris, and groceries, public transportation and other expenses are also significantly lower than in the US.\n\n“Outside Paris, there are parts of France that are very, very affordable, competitively affordable,” says Peddicord. With her family, she splits time between Paris and Panama City and says many people are surprised to learn that Paris is the cheaper of the two.\n\nShe advises anyone with a dream of living their golden years in the City of Light to not immediately write it off as unaffordable. “If you’re focused on Paris, for example, even that you shouldn’t take off your list without really doing some research.”\n\nKey considerations: One of the biggest advantages for France-bound American retirees is the ability to continue contributing to tax-advantaged US retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Thanks to the US-France tax treaty, these accounts will continue to be taxed at US rates for Americans living in France, instead of potentially higher French income tax rates.\n\nHowever, one caveat about inheritance tax: Unlike the US, in France the tax applies per beneficiary instead of the total estate value. In addition, forced heirship rules require set amounts for legal heirs — something retirees with sizable estates should take into consideration.\n\nFrance’s bureaucracy can be intimidating, especially for those who don’t speak French. English isn’t as widely spoken as in some other European countries, especially outside of major cities.\n\nHow to make the move: Ready to say oui to retiring in France? US citizens can apply for\n\nthe Long-Stay Visa for Retirement (Visa de Long Séjour pour Retraité). This option will require proof of sufficient financial resources, as well as health insurance. You’ll apply for this visa at the nearest French consulate in the US, after which you obtain what’s known as the carte de séjour visiteur (a residence visa). Your pension must be at least $1,073 as a single or $1,666 as a couple. The visa is only valid for one year, but it can be renewed.\n\nMalaysia\n\nRetirees can get more bang for their buck in Malaysia. Stuart Westmorland/Corbis Documentary RF/Getty Images\n\nMalaysia, which ranked seventh on International Living’s 2025 Global Retirement Index, offers “truly extraordinary” bang for your buck, Stevens says. It’s well suited for those looking to stretch their budgets, as well as retirees craving a comfortable lifestyle for “so much less than it would cost you in the States,” she explains. “And if you want to live simply, you can do it for next to nothing.”\n\nAccording to data from International Living, rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Kuala Lumpur usually runs between $300 and $500, with monthly utilities costing around $40-60. Outside the capital, second-tier cities such as Penang and Malacca also offer superb value and slightly lower rent costs, along with a slower pace of life and robust expat communities.\n\nMalaysia’s health care system also ranks highly, with modern facilities, English-speaking staff and affordable and excellent quality of care. Another bonus for retirees: Money you bring into the country is tax-exempt.\n\nIn addition, the southeast Asian country is a veritable melting pot of cultures and cuisines, and English is widely spoken (official signage also is written in English). “In some ways, it’s easier to navigate that part of the world than it is, say, Mexico, if you don’t speak Spanish,” Stevens says.\n\nKey considerations: Malaysia has a humid, tropical climate year-round, which may not be the best fit for those who prefer a change of season. In addition, for retirees who envision frequent trips back to the US, traveling from Malaysia is a beast, with flights alone at more than 20 hours.\n\nHow to make the move: Malaysia provides several visa options that are specifically aimed toward retirees. The most popular is the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program, which offers a renewable multiple-entry visa. To qualify, you must be over 50 years old, as well as meet some financial requirements: deposit approximately $35,883 into a bank in Malaysia; (global institutions including Citibank and HSBC also qualify), or prove you have a monthly income of approximately $2,350 from a government pension.\n\nSpain\n\nWith excellent weather, high-quality health care, a relatively low cost of living and world-famous gastronomy, this European country has been a perennially popular spot among the retiree set for decades. In InterNations’ 2024 Expat City Ranking, Spanish cities captured the top three spots (Valencia, Malaga and Alicante) out of 53 cities; Madrid, meanwhile, ranked seventh and Barcelona, 21st.\n\nIn addition, Spain boasts a wide variety of options for different lifestyles, from the cosmopolitan hub of Madrid to small villages up and down the country’s Mediterranean coastline, as well as the northern Basque region along Spain’s Atlantic coast.\n\nWhat to consider: Spain’s tax system can be complicated, and it differs from one autonomous region to another. The general rule of thumb is that if you spend more than 183 days per calendar year in Spain, you’re considered a tax resident.\n\nEnglish proficiency is among the lowest in Europe, especially outside major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. Castilian Spanish is spoken by the majority of Spaniards, but some autonomous regions have their own official language (Catalan in Catalonia, for example, and Basque, or Euskara, in the Basque Country).\n\nFinally, don’t expect any early-bird dinner specials: Spaniards rarely eat their evening meal before 8:30 p.m.\n\nHow to make the move: Spain’s non-lucrative visa (or NLV, also known as a retirement visa), is a popular route for Americans. It’s aimed primarily at those with sufficient passive income or financial means to not be a burden on Spain’s welfare system (currently, the minimum is about $2,600 per month for a single applicant; additional family members require more funds per member).\n\nYou’ll apply through your nearest consulate (note: this links to the Los Angeles consulate but outlines the process step-by-step). You’ll also need to show proof of insurance in Spain, which can be a tricky step to navigate (travel insurance is not accepted, by the way). Be prepared for plenty of paperwork and for appointments to be booked far in advance, so plan accordingly.\n\nMexico\n\nThe Mexican city of San Miguel de Allende is loved for its colonial architecture and timeless charm. ferrantraite/iStock Unreleased/Getty Images\n\nThe US’s southern neighbor consistently ranks high as a top retiree destination (it was fourth in International Living’s Global Retirement Index for 2025). Its proximity to the US, affordability, and slower pace of life are strong draws. Mexico also offers an excellent option for retirees who want to live abroad only part-time.\n\nMeanwhile, thriving English-speaking expat communities in most cities, as well as many of the same service providers popular in the US, including Netflix and Amazon, help ease the transition for newcomers.\n\nMexico also offers several tax advantages that are especially beneficial to retirees. It doesn’t have inheritance or wealth tax, and unlike many other countries, tax residency is determined not by the total number of days spent in the country, but whether your primary home or center of business is established there.\n\nKey considerations: Mexico ranks among the least peaceful countries in Latin America. According to government statistics, there were 31,062 homicides in 2023, about 24 per 100,000 residents (in the US, that figure was about six per 100,000 people in 2023, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data).\n\nCartel-related violence and drug trafficking in Mexico may capture the majority of media attention, but pettier crimes such as theft and pickpocketing are the most reported problems.\n\nIn addition, as is the case in some other countries including Portugal, an influx of foreigners and increasing gentrification in certain cities has sparked growing tensions in some areas with large expat populations.\n\nHow to make the move: Valid passport holders from countries that don’t require a visa (including the United States) can remain in Mexico for up to 180 days. (They still must complete a visitor’s permit, or Forma Migratoria Multiple (FMM), at their port of entry. Keep in mind that the exact number of days allowed remains at the discretion of the immigration official processing entry.)\n\nFor longer stays, retirees can look into visas as temporary and permanent residents. Both are fairly straightforward, but applicants must be able to demonstrate financial stability.",

        "content": "Seattle CNN —\n\nNed Johnson is not dead. The 82-year-old proved as much by bounding across a Seattle sidewalk to greet us with a firm handshake and a broad grin. But Ned was declared dead last month by the Social Security Administration, which led him and his wife on a Kafkaesque quest to prove there’s life left in this salty old Seattle seadog yet.\n\nNed has spent his life building business and sailing the world’s oceans, and he’s spent the past few weeks proving to bureaucrats and reporters that he’s still very much alive.\n\n“There’s been a lot of gallows humor,” giggled Ned’s equally spry wife, Pamela. But there’s also been some serious red tape to reverse.\n\n“You’re on the dead list,” deadpanned Ned, who is suspicious that all this might somehow be connected to President Donald Trump’s declarations that there are thousands of dead centenarians still collecting Social Security payments: false assertions enthusiastically parroted by the president’s dogged DOGE lieutenant, Elon Musk.\n\nTrump told a crowd in Florida last month, “There is one person on Social Security who is 360 years old.” And the president said during his recent address to Congress, “We’re gonna find where that money is going and it won’t be pretty.”\n\nDOGE now has at least 10 staffers working inside the SSA, six of them are involved with the death data. The first started work on February 13 analyzing “improper payments” and “the death master file,” according to court filings in an unrelated suit filed against the SSA. Five days later, Ned Johnson was declared dead.\n\n“That is a curious coincidence,” the rather wry Ned told CNN. “There’s a lot of unanswered questions,” added Pamela. “But I think that maybe we’ll never know.”\n\nTheir bank, they say, was informed electronically on February 18 of Ned’s “passing” and the following day sent a letter to his presumably grieving Pamela. “We offer our sincerest condolences. I understand this is a difficult time,” were among the first words in that letter she opened and read over breakfast one morning in their airy, antique-stuffed Seattle apartment.\n\nNed's wife Pamela scoffed when asked if she had received an apology from the Social Security Administration. CNN\n\n“It was a little weird,” she told CNN while sitting at that same oak dining table. “Because he was sitting next to me drinking coffee.”\n\nThe Johnsons assumed this was an attempted scam, until money started disappearing from their bank account. Ned had been among the roughly 73 million Americans who receive Social Security checks every month. Those payments stopped and, he said, the SSA also clawed back any payments made after the date of his alleged demise: November 23, 2024.\n\nNed says Social Security told the bank the dollar amount to take back. “This amount out of this account - and they said, ‘OK’,” he explained. “They just take it without permission,” added Pamela. “Apparently, they can do that because they have gotten this form from whatever hospital.”\n\nNeither the bank nor the SSA was able to tell the Johnsons where that form came from, or to share it with them.\n\n“I was told by the bank that ‘We have no way of communicating with Social Security,’” Ned said. “’It comes electronically to us. We automatically react to it,’” he said he was told of the bank procedure.\n\nThis is not a new or even a rare phenomenon. “More than three million deaths are reported to the Social Security Administration each year,” the agency revealed in a news release after Ned Johnson went public about his own alleged demise. “Less than one-third of 1 percent are erroneously reported deaths that need to be corrected,” that release continues. But even that tiny percentage is roughly 9,000 people reported dead each year who are, in fact, still living and breathing and in need of their benefits. And the onus is on them to prove they are still alive.\n\nNed and Pamela Johnson explain what they had discovered to CNN's Nick Watt. CNN\n\nNed was eventually “resurrected” after spending nearly eight hours waiting at a Social Security office in downtown Seattle armed with his passport and himself as proof of life.\n\nHe did get his rightful benefits back, after he went public with his story in The Seattle Times. But he’s worried his death might still be lingering in other data. “They canceled my Medicare insurance and our health insurance,” said Ned. He did manage to get them restored. But he’s concerned that next time he travels abroad that his passport might not work, and he might have trouble getting a new credit card. “Your credit status goes to zero as soon as you’re declared deceased in the Social Security system,” he explained.\n\nJohnson also worries for others who might not have the time or ability to prove they’re still living. “Somebody’s disabled,” he said. “They can’t get out of a wheelchair or whatever, and they live 100 miles from the nearest Social Security office: what are they going to do?”\n\nNed says the office was woefully understaffed the day he visited, with perhaps just three of 30 windows staffed, hence his long wait that he says should have been even longer. “One of the booths opened up and the next person was there, and I jumped in front of him, ran up,” said Ned. “I pleaded with this woman. I said, ‘I’ve been here all day and by the way, I’m declared dead.’”\n\nWait times might be about to get even worse because the SSA will now limit the number of recipients who can identify their identity online, and now no one will be able to verify their bank details over the phone. Experts estimate that will mean the need for tens of thousands more in-person visits to Social Security offices.\n\nBut the federal building in Seattle Johnson visited was earmarked for sale on a since-deleted government list. The SSA is planning to close several regional offices and is right now in the process of slashing roughly 12% of its workforce. The SSA claims the restructuring, which is, “Consistent with recent executive orders issued by the White House,” will actually, “prioritize customer service by streamlining redundant layers of management… and (involve) potential reassignment of employees to customer service positions.”\n\nFor Pamela, the non-widow, there’s a big question about how effective that will be. “To me anyway,” she said, the changes could create “more waste fraud and abuse than if they had a professional fully staffed office with easy accessible internet and a decent phone system.”",

So is all the technology out there that’s marketed toward new parents, from smart bassinets to high-tech baby monitors and breastfeeding tracker apps. What gadgets do new parents actually need, and do you need them at all? Sophie Brickman explored this in her book Baby, Unplugged , and she shares some insights for fellow parents in the digital age.\n\nDownload Transcript Episode Transcript\n\nClare Duffy 00:00:04 Welcome to another episode of Terms of Service. I'm Clare Duffy. And to kick off today's episode, I have CNN Audio's senior producer, Haley Thomas, back with me. Loyal listeners might remember Haley from a previous episode we did about how to manage your passwords, and Haley bravely put herself on the line for us. Right, Haley?\n\nHaley Thomas 00:00:23 I did. I'm back again. I think I'm the problem.\n\nClare Duffy 00:00:26 You're the inspiration. Today we have you here to talk about something much happier. You became a parent very recently, and you told me something you noticed as you were getting ready to be a mom: all the technology that's out there that's marketed to new parents. So that's what we're going to talk about today. But first, congratulations.\n\nHaley Thomas 00:00:45 'Thank you, thank you. It's amazing and exhausting and anxiety-inducing, all of the things.\n\nClare Duffy 00:00:51 So when you first started preparing for parenthood, what kinds of advice were you getting? What kinds of products were people telling you that you needed to buy?\n\nHaley Thomas 00:01:00 Well, throwback to our is your phone listening to you episode because I swear it's somehow listening because as soon as we became pregnant, all of my ads on every social media platform was parenting things and a lot of parenting tech, a lot of use this device to rock your baby to sleep. Use this device to know your baby's heart rate and if they're dreaming, and it was an onslaught of a lot of stuff, and a lot of it was was heavy tech, AI influenced.\n\nClare Duffy 00:01:31 Know if your baby is dreaming is insane.\n\nHaley Thomas 00:01:34 Insane, and do they dream? Do we need to know that? I don't know.\n\nClare Duffy 00:01:38 Do we need to know? I don't know. How did you feel about all of those options and possibilities? Like obviously becoming a parent in the first place is like kind of overwhelming. How are you thinking about, you know, what you really needed and what you didn't, and how did you process all of that?\n\nHaley Thomas 00:01:54 Yeah, it is overwhelming. I think the beauty is that my mother was like, we did it with relatively nothing, right? And so that I kept in my mind every time I would see an ad that was like, you need this for your baby, because a lot of it is like, you need this for your baby to keep your baby safe, to know how your baby's feeling, to like, feed them the right way. It was overwhelming, but I kept asking, do we need it? And at what cost does that come? What data? What privacy do we have to share to get that information?\n\nClare Duffy 00:02:26 So what did you end up buying, not buying, what are you using now?\n\nHaley Thomas 00:02:32 Honestly, we went fairly minimal. I put it in air quotes because, you know, in today's society I don't know what minimal really means, but we basically said no to all the things that were high tech that our friends suggested that we absolutely needed. We didn't do it. Maybe some of the stuff would have made it easier, but I don't really know if becoming a new parent is all that easy. So we didn't get any of those things. And we're surviving, and I think we're thriving. I think he's thriving. So it's the route we wanted to take. Not to say the other one is a bad one. It's just, it's what we chose.\n\nClare Duffy 00:03:03 Yeah. And certainly you can always upgrade if you decide.\n\nHaley Thomas 00:03:07 You can buy anything on the internet these days. So if we really needed something, we would do it, for sure.\n\nClare Duffy 00:03:16 Haley's not alone in feeling overwhelmed by all of the technology out there that's geared towards new parents. Baby tech is a broad category and covers everything from apps to track breastfeeding to physical products to engage or soothe babies. So on this episode, I'm going to talk to reporter and writer Sophie Brickman. She wrote a book that takes a deep dive into baby tech and what parents really need. Well, Sophie, thanks for doing this.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:03:46 Thank you so much for having me.\n\nClare Duffy 00:03:47 So you're a mother of three?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:03:49 Yes.\n\nClare Duffy 00:03:50 Take us back to when you and your husband were preparing for your first baby. It was 2016. What kinds of products were you buying, and what was the prep like?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:03:58 'Oh, I mean like nothing, I don't know, I had a few friends who had had kids before me. And so I sort of, you know, people had spreadsheets that they shared. I was living in an extremely small apartment in Manhattan that was a walk up, so like I couldn't get extra stuff, and I had the bare minimum. I remember getting like four onesies, and my friend called and was like, that's cute. Like, you're going to go through four onesies in one hour. So I had like very little stuff. But my husband is in the tech world, and so he had access to a lot of kind of early-stage products. And when I got pregnant, he sort of got interested in baby-related ones. He brought home one kind of monitoring, sort of smart sock that was in its very early stages, and the promise was that it would tell you if your baby's heart rate was good or something was going wrong, and we strapped it on our like three-day-old, and it went off in the middle of the night with this like horrible alarm that was actually just telling us that it had lost connection to the Wi-Fi. But I thought that something had happened.\n\nClare Duffy 00:04:57 Was this the first night that you used it?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:04:59 Yeah, and I was like not a very confident new mother. I didn't know what I was doing, and this little gadget was saying, you know, it's going to keep your baby safe, and you don't have to worry. And I was like, great, let's do it, let's try it. And then that happened, and I suddenly was kind of forced to confront, you know, the thoughtlessness and sort of the mindlessness with which we just adopt technology in our lives.\n\nClare Duffy 00:05:20 That's terrifying.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:05:21 Yes, it was. It was.\n\nClare Duffy 00:05:23 And so from there, like, what made you decide to take this deep dive into the world of baby tech?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:05:29 I mean, there's the, like, cute answer, which is that I wanted to prove my husband wrong and be like, I'm just going to go write a book about how this technology is not great. And then there's the real one, which is I wanted to explore both my reliance on technology and children's kind of infusion of technology. There's a lot of tech around, and I think that we just sort of adopt it because the promise is to make you more efficient and you have far less time in your day when you're a new mother. And it seems really appealing. But what does the science say about this stuff in terms of keeping your children safe or making you less anxious, making everybody more successful? And also, what as a society may we be missing if we're kind of slapping technology onto big problems and issues that are around raising a human.\n\nClare Duffy 00:06:17 Can you describe the process that you went through to report your book, who you spoke with and what that research looked like?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:06:23 I researched like everything down to the final minute, so I spoke to entrepreneurs and technologists and venture capitalists. I spoke to developmental psychologists. I spoke to people who are making children's media and professors and a lot of pediatricians. I became very close with my kids' pediatrician, but I tried to find sort of a large swath of different experts. And I knew going into this like there was no way I was going to excise technology entirely from my life. I have my phone the same way that everybody else does. I wanted to try to find some middle ground that made me feel comfortable as a parent.\n\nClare Duffy 00:06:56 'Just like Haley, when Sophie became a parent, she discovered an abundance of high tech, data-driven devices based on nearly every imaginable baby need.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:07:07 So, you know, when you bring your kid home and you're nursing, there are apps that can track what you're feeding your kid. There's a lot of weighing. There's a lot of data crunching. There's a lot of stuff around sleep, because I think that is something that parents crave and need. There are a lot of devices, from smart bassinets to trackers that you can put on your kid that are telling you like what cycle of REM stage the kid is in. It's very, it's very intense, or it can be.\n\nClare Duffy 00:07:34 Right, in the same way that we do with so much other technology, I can imagine myself just being glued to it.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:07:39 Of course.\n\nClare Duffy 00:07:40 Like, you know, now I have this real time monitor of my child's sleep, maybe I should be paying attention to it instead of sleeping myself.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:07:49 And I had like a crazy realization you know the first day that I went back to work after my daughter was born. She was, I don't know, three months, and I left her in very capable hands, and then I went to my desk at the office, and I watched her on the monitor through my phone, sleeping, and it was like really boring. And I couldn't stop checking up on it. And I was like, what is this? This means I can't do either thing. I'm not there with her. I'm not here at work. I'm just sort of glued to the most boring livestream you've ever watched in your life, but it's very hard to look away.\n\nClare Duffy 00:08:20 What are new parents experiencing when they enter this market of baby tech? It seems pretty overwhelming. There's so many options. What are some of the challenges that you ran into when making the decisions about what to buy and what to skip?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:08:33 I think really taking a breath and trying to figure out what you're trying to solve for. And do you need to do that through a phone? Do you really need to know down to the minute how long your child is sleeping? Or can you sort of like relax into knowing that, like they will get there eventually? There are so many products coming at parents so rapidly, and they're a very vulnerable population because they are tired and because they are taking care of the newly most important thing in their lives that they're new to, and nobody wants to screw that up. So I think, you know, the market takes advantage of that very easily.\n\nClare Duffy 00:09:07 Sophie said the baby tech market exploded as the hardware inside some devices, like small cameras and sensors, became cheaper to make. Monitoring and tracking your child became a normal part of parenting, promising to solve for one key problem.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:09:24 Safety. Safety is the big one. A lot of these sleep ones will say this will help. You know, almost every new parent is terrified of something horrible happening, and they're nervous about SIDs and all of these...\n\nClare Duffy 00:09:37 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, if people don't know\n\nSophie Brickman 00:09:38 'Yes. Truly, truly tragic things that can happen — rarely but can. And so they really drill in on safety. When you go down and look at the fine print, and you look at the asterisk that's way, way, way, way, way at the bottom of the website, most of them say like, this is not FDA approved. This is not a medical device. And I spoke to somebody who studies SIDs at a hospital, and she said there was a study done, however many years ago, where we sent medically-approved devices home with parents that had been in the hospital, and like that didn't have an effect in any way, so the idea that another non-medical device would have a different and more beneficial effect doesn't seem to ring true. She also said something that I can't verify but stuck with me. She was like, there are certain safe sleeping practices that you should do with your kid. You don't co-sleep. You put them in a certain type of crib, whatever. She was like, a lot of these devices can encourage parents to say, like, whatever, I'll slap this device on you, but then I want to sleep with you in my bed anyway. And so she said like it encourages behavior that is actually not as safe as it would be without this sort of pretend added layer of safety underneath it, through the technology.\n\nClare Duffy 00:10:47 Right, you have the kind of false confidence that, oh, now it's going to be okay to make different choices. A lot of these monitoring products are, as you said, sort of meant to alleviate new parents' anxiety. Was that your experience? Is that the experience of other parents who you've spoken with?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:11:03 By and large, no, it was not my experience. I found myself addicted to the information, and it's like what my daughter wanted was me to be touching her and holding her and with her and connecting with her. But having this sort of scrim of technology in between the two of us was something that felt wrong, but was very hard for me to look away from. And I, you know, we're primed to do that. Like evolutionarily deep in our core, we as humans gather information and filter it. And so it's hard to look away from this kind of new input. But I found myself getting very overwhelmed by it.\n\nClare Duffy 00:11:37 But there are also parents for whom the opposite is true. For them, technology provides much needed peace of mind.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:11:45 There was one good friend of mine whose child was in the NICU, where the child had been monitored for, like, 24/7 by multiple professionals. And the first night that she came home from the hospital, she was like, that was a real sea change for me because I was on my own, and I know that the doctors wouldn't have let my child come home if she wasn't able to be okay on her own. But she used various technology devices that she said gave her a lot of calm. And so there I think it's like each case is different.\n\nClare Duffy 00:12:11 Yeah. So there are sort of like shades of what might work better for certain people or not. I think the point about instincts is so interesting. That's something that you hear parents say, like, I got used to certain cries that my kid would do and what they might mean, and it just makes me wonder if you instead have an app you become less attuned to those cues.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:12:30 Or, like, what does this cry mean? And it's like, I don't know. It's one of two or three things, right? It's like the baby's tired, the baby's hungry, or the baby, like, needs to have a diaper change. It's not rocket science. And I think that overall the big picture is that, like, you want to be connecting to your child and building the confidence to really know your child. And also, I think, learning to sort of relax into the chaos of being a parent. Like the promise of Silicon Valley and a lot of these products that come out of it is efficiency and optimization. I don't know if you can optimize a moment more than just sort of sitting on the ground with them and building a block tower with them.\n\nClare Duffy 00:13:09 As with any area of parenting, decisions about technology are super personal. And while some devices can make late nights or meal tracking easier, is any of it necessary to make you a better parent? And what options do you have if you're priced out of the latest gadget? That's after the break. Some of these higher tech products are also really expensive. If you're shopping on a budget for your baby, are any of them really for you? Are there cheaper options?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:13:46 There can be. It depends what you're talking about. I mean, like when you talk about quote unquote technology, there's a huge range of things, but there are many apps. Some of them are free. You know, the very first time that I used technology related to my kid was to monitor contractions. And I downloaded a free app, and I was in bed at two in the morning, and I was like, oh, they're getting pretty close together. And so, I mean, that was helpful. I could have used a piece of paper and a pen. That was another way to do that. I think that you can spend a lot of money if you want to. And I think the kind of nefarious moment comes when companies are trying to capitalize on that vulnerability and say, like, you want your kid to be sleeping soundly through the night, spend $1,000 on a bassinet, it's really going to change your life, and it changes some people's lives. But is it necessary? Not all the time.\n\nClare Duffy 00:14:30 Do you think that this tech is potentially furthering the sort of socioeconomic or digital divide among parents, given how expensive these things can be?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:14:39 'One of the most interesting and illuminating conversations I had was with this very well-regarded developmental psychologist named Alison Gopnik, and she works out in Berkeley and has a lab where she, you know, does a lot of things with tiny little babies. And we talked about sort of inequality in general. And she said, you know, the anxiety that parents feel to, like, get everything for their kid and prop them up, she said, I feel like is coming directly from this inequality and this gap of not wanting to have your kid fall out of the middle class or wherever it is that you are and trying to do everything that you can to support them. So I think that that's definitely part of it.\n\nClare Duffy 00:15:14 Yeah. With your research, you were trying to sort of sort out what was necessary, what's beneficial, what's too much. Is there any technology that you think is a need for new parents based on your reporting?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:15:27 A need? No, I don't think so. I think that certain things can help and make things easier. I think, you know, there are some apps that help you track feeding in the beginning that are a slightly more high tech equivalent of a piece of paper and a pen. And so, like, it's fine, and it's easier. You can see some trends. A lot of them then come with like splicing data in more ways, and then you're like, oh, the kid got cranky at 3 p.m. and maybe I should, like, inch up the feed by 14 minutes. It's like, that makes you more anxious. And I think they always say, like, if you're a calm parent, your baby will be calm. And it's like the stress level can ratchet up with a lot of this technology. You know, there are questions you should be asking yourself without just sort of blindly accepting this idea that, like, optimization is the goal.\n\nClare Duffy 00:16:12 Yeah, well, and one of my questions, too, is like, okay, if you start tracking your kid as a baby, where does it end? When do you stop?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:16:20 There's a writer named Pamela Druckerman who wrote this book called Bringing Up Bebe, and she's an American who raised her kids in France. And I asked her about this, like, what do the French think about it? And she was like, that's exactly the problem. They think if you start tracking these kids in their bassinet, where does it end? Where does their independence come from? You know, and I think that that's another sort of big question you have to think about: What are you teaching your child by monitoring their every movement and burp and fart and pee and everything?\n\nClare Duffy 00:16:48 When Sophie's babies were born, they weren't at risk. So tracking them wasn't medically necessary. To decide what tech to use, she turned to a trusted expert.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:16:59 'And I remember I would call my pediatrician, he's a pretty old school pediatrician, over and over again and be like, do I need to know this? And he kept saying he was like, if you needed to know this, we wouldn't let you go home from the hospital. Like if you needed to be monitoring this closely, like, there are pediatric checkups at a certain cadence that is understood to be the cadence you need in order to catch the milestones and make sure that the kid is progressing the way that they want to progress. This like minute up-to-the-second data collection is not necessary for most children, and so I think that should be a form of comfort for parents. You don't need to be doing all of this.\n\nClare Duffy 00:17:35 And what about all the data that is collected by these baby tech devices? Do you have privacy concerns about how that data is used by the companies?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:17:44 I mean, I don't know what they're going to get me on knowing that my kid was a crappy sleeper?\n\nClare Duffy 00:17:50 Starbucks advertisements or something.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:17:53 That would be embarrassing for me, I guess. Yes, there are privacy concerns. Like, I did a lot of reporting for a different section of this book that was about the amount of photos that I take of my kids and sort of why we take so many photos and memorialize all these moments and, like, what is the impulse to do this? And I have like 9,000 photos of my kid's toe, and what does that mean? And there are privacy concerns there for sure. In terms of how people are using sleep data and that and like how much I nursed my kid, I'm not sure. It depends what type of person you are, you know? I would imagine that if you are the type of person that is nervous about privacy, then you should not be logging every single last detail about your kid. So I think people often pick and choose.\n\nClare Duffy 00:18:34 'Parents who are concerned about privacy do have some more analog options. You could choose baby monitors that aren't Wi-Fi enabled, or you could opt out of syncing data to your phone or across other devices. No matter what, though, there are still a lot of choices out there. If a new parent came to you feeling overwhelmed by all of these choices: what to buy, what to skip, what to monitor? What's your best advice for them?\n\nSophie Brickman 00:19:02 My best advice is to say that when you bring a new human into the house, the idea that you can control what they do and how they are and when they sleep and when they eat is sort of folly. And that you learn that with time, and you learn that you can only kind of do so much to make your kid have a particular outcome in a given moment. And so hacking and optimizing that moment with technology is not necessarily the end game. And I think that the endgame is to try to be present when you're there, and to try to sit down on the rug with them and play with them and delight in them and look at them giggling and respond to their cries. And do your best to be analog when you're with them, because friction is a big thing that technology aims to get rid of. You can order things on your phone. You don't have to interact with anybody. But friction is what makes parenting rich and full and human. And so if your aim is to get rid of the friction, you're missing out on so much. And I would say that you don't need any of this stuff. And some of it sprinkle in, and it'll help you, but you don't need it. It's not a necessity.\n\nClare Duffy 00:20:14 Awesome. Well, Sophie, thank you so much.\n\nSophie Brickman 00:20:16 Thank you for having me.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa was engulfed in flames late Thursday after being struck by a large-scale Russian drone attack, hours after US President Donald Trump expressed optimism about ending the war and as peace talks are set to resume on Monday.\n\nTrump – who recently held separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky on implementing a partial ceasefire – projected optimism about reaching an end to the war on Thursday, saying “we’re doing pretty well in that regard.”\n\nDelegations from Russia and the US are expected to resume talks on ending the war on Monday in Saudi Arabia, both countries’ officials said, following an earlier round of talks in February.\n\nZelensky said a team from Ukraine will also attend, with parallel meetings likely to take place, and urged Putin to “stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war.”\n\n“I believe we’ll get it done. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said on Thursday, referring to the talks.\n\nHours after Trump spoke, Russia launched a “massive” drone attack on Odesa, hitting civilian targets and injuring at least three people, including a minor, local officials said.\n\nA high-rise residential building and a shopping center were among the targets, local governor Oleh Kiper said.\n\nResidents surveyed the damage as the sun rose on Friday morning. Oleksandr/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVideos shared on social media show what appears to be civilian infrastructure on fire and huge plumes of smoke rising over the city. CNN has not been able to immediately verify the videos.\n\nCzech President Peter Pavel was in the port city on an official visit at the time of the attack, Ukrainian official Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian assaults wounded at least five others near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Thursday, local governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\nNearly 200 drones also hit the Kirovohrad region in central Ukraine overnight into Thursday, wounding 10 people, including four children, and damaging homes, a church, and key infrastructure, Zelensky said.\n\n“Russian strikes on Ukraine do not stop, despite their propaganda claims. Every day and every night, nearly a hundred or more drones are launched, along with ongoing missile attacks. With each such launch, the Russians expose to the world their true attitude towards peace,” Zelensky said Thursday on X.\n\nA frame from a video shared by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine shows fire fighters battling a blaze in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, on Thursday, March 20. State Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\nUkraine and Russia have exchanged aerial assaults in the days since the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, Ukraine struck a military airfield deep inside Russian territory, sparking a huge explosion and destroying nearby houses, Russian and Ukrainian officials said.\n\nUkraine’s military confirmed it was behind the attack on Engels airbase - more than 465 miles from the Ukrainian border - saying it targeted the airbase because it is used by Russia’s air force “to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine and terrorist attacks against the civilian population.”\n\nZelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones, including strikes on energy facilities.\n\nZelensky has said he is “ready” to pause attacks on Russia’s energy and civilian infrastructure, saying his team will prepare a list of civilian targets to be included in a future deal.\n\nUkraine “unconditionally agrees” to a ceasefire, but is “waiting for the aggressor to agree,” Zelensky said Thursday while speaking at a press conference in Norway.\n\nPutin announced the halt on energy infrastructure attacks on Tuesday after a lengthy call with Trump. “Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order,” a Kremlin readout said.\n\nAs part of its demands for a broader ceasefire, the Kremlin laid out several tough conditions that Putin had previously insisted on – such as a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence to Kyiv, and a halt to any Ukrainian mobilization or rearming during that period.\n\nZelensky spoke to European leaders on Thursday as they reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, calling on other Western leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as Trump escalates his courting of Russia.\n\n“The stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiation table,” the European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said of the Ukrainians, according to Reuters.\n\nThe meetings in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh on Monday are designed for US and Russian officials to hammer out more specific language on the deal reached by Trump and Putin, as well as other areas of negotiation toward a full ceasefire. The talks won’t involve Cabinet-level US officials, the State Department said Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the name of the Ukrainian official Oleksiy Kuleba.",

        "title": "Trump delivers on a generational conservative goal, but it could be risky for Republicans as well as students",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump is claiming generational wins for the Republican Party on the cultural and ideological battlefield of education – which MAGA supporters see as a hostile bastion of liberal power ripe for disruption.\n\nIn a move he described as “45 years in the making,” Trump, seated among children at desks in a mock classroom set up in the White House, signed an executive order designed to obliterate the Department of Education.\n\n“It sounds strange, doesn’t it? Department of Education, we’re going to eliminate it,” Trump said, aware that he’s unlikely to get Congress to vote to abolish the agency – but that he can suffocate it from the inside anyway.\n\nRepublicans see the department as a hotbed of liberal activism, a source of “woke” social policies on diversity and inclusion and an ally of teachers’ unions, which are a foundation of the Democratic Party. A sense among GOP voters that the department promotes values antithetical to conservative principles was exacerbated by school closures during the pandemic and by debate about how to treat transgender students.\n\nBut Trump does not just have K-12 education in his sights as he attempts to use aggressive executive power in his second term. The administration is piling pressure on elite universities over curriculums. It’s cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants as part of its purge of the federal government. And it is provoking fear on campuses with its hardline immigration policies that have targeted several academics and activists.\n\nThe approach has caused fears about government interference in higher education and about the suppression of the constitutional right to free speech – which is only underscored when it protects rhetoric that many Americans view as unacceptable.\n\nThe crackdown also raised the prospect that an American national jewel – the global power, reach and reputation of scientific research at US college – could be damaged and that there could be a drain of scientific brains and funding to foreign nations. Just last week, for instance, Johns Hopkins University announced that it was cutting 2,000 jobs across 44 countries after it lost $800 million in funding during the effort to dismantle the US Agency for International Development.\n\nTrump takes aim at elite universities\n\nElite universities especially are braced for an escalation in the Trump administration’s campaign – since they are regarded in the GOP as incubators of liberal protest and mores that the MAGA movement seeks to eradicate.\n\nThe philosophy was summed up by now-Vice President JD Vance, a graduate of Yale Law School who was at the time a Senate candidate, at a National Conservatism conference in 2021. Vance advocated a campaign against “very hostile institutions” and added: “If any of us want to do the things we want to do for our country and the people who live in it – we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.”\n\nSuch talk concerns historians familiar with the strategy of totalitarian leaders overseas, who target universities and other institutions, such as the press, as part of a broader assault against free speech.\n\nOne of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s earliest acts in his 25-year rule was to drive Western-oriented and liberal democratic influences out of Russian universities as he suppressed academic freedoms. And one of the heroes of Trump’s MAGA operatives is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has long battered liberal institutions like universities. This is part of a playbook that also foreshadowed Trump’s aggressive attempts to co-opt big business and to push executive power to the limit – and sometimes beyond constitutional limits.\n\nThe administration’s new front in its immigration enforcement operation at universities was highlighted by the detention this month of Columbia graduate and Palestinian green card holder Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead campus protests last year against Israel’s war on Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks. The case is only one of several involving students at US universities linked to the Middle East, and Trump has promised a much wider sweep.\n\n“This is the first arrest of many to come,” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month in a reference to Khalil. “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.”\n\nElise Stefanik, Trump’s nominee to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile saw her profile in MAGA world – and nationally – soar after she made alleged antisemitism at Ivy League schools a signature issue. The New York representative’s campaign was instrumental in the resignation of President Claudine Gay at Harvard University – Stefanik’s alma mater.\n\nWhy education is such a fertile field for Republicans\n\nPolitical incentives for Republicans to target education have steadily grown over recent decades as the party has transitioned from a haven for elites to a populist force that now speaks for working-class and non-college-educated voters – a process sent into overdrive by Trump in 2016.\n\nAt the same time, the Democratic Party has moved away from its blue-collar roots and based its most recent presidential election wins on big student turnout, college graduates and more affluent voters. The apparent contempt by some leading progressives for the party’s former power base, and the way that universities have become havens for liberal social campaigns that alienate many conservatives, have hardened this new political fault line.\n\nIn fact, education level has now become one of the defining characteristics of political affiliation – and one of the starkest divides in a nation full of them. In CNN exit polls of the 2024 election, 56% of college graduates voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, while an identical percentage of voters without a college degree voted for Trump.\n\nTop Republican politicians have also understood that fanning conservative hostility toward elite educational institutions can be a political winner. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, was a bitter critic of school shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. He’s also trying to remake his state’s public universities to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and to seek ideological reforms by using the leverage of state funding in a model for Trump at the federal level.\n\nTrump hedges on some aspects of his assault on the Education Department\n\nTrump’s executive order went a long way to fulfilling a promise made by President Ronald Reagan – whom he has replaced as the ideological guiding light of the modern Republican Party.\n\nIt instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the states.”\n\nThe president justified the move by claiming that the US spends more money on education than many developed nations and yet trails in many educational standards assessments. Like many Republicans, he blamed such failures on the Education Department and argued that returning school policy and funding to states would fix the problem. However, since almost all education policy, hiring of teachers, responsibility for curricula and even the provision of textbooks already lies with the states and local school boards, he may be choosing the wrong target.\n\nThe Department of Education plays a vital role in managing the critical student loans sector; Pell grants for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and funding for special education, students with disabilities and those from poorer areas.\n\nThe White House announced that student loans would remain within the department, as would some other popular programs, while Trump said that Pell grants and funding and resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be “fully preserved” but may move to other departments and agencies.\n\nThis switch raises the possibility that while Trump seeks an ideological victory and a new highlight for his perpetual political show, he’s worried that he and his fellow Republicans could pay a price for the disruption. This is especially the case since many of the federal funds disbursed for education go to red states that spend less per pupil on education. According to educationdata.org, for instance, 8 of the top 10 states in accepting federal funding for K-12 students voted for the president in 2024.\n\nKim Anderson, the executive director of the National Education Association, told CNN International on Thursday that Trump’s moves would directly affect conservative-leaning districts from where he draws staunch support.\n\n“They are going to have a lot fewer dollars to spread around to take care of students’ needs, class sizes are going to go up, after-school programs are going to go down,” Anderson said. “There are so many gaps that are going to impact students and what they need to thrive and to live into their full potential.”\n\nWhile Trump claimed his moment of generational triumph on education on Thursday, he’s also taking a big risk for students – and for the prospects of the Republican Party, which could now face some of the political downsides of its long quest to close the Department of Education.",

However, many economists and consumer advocates say the widespread use of these services, plus a lack of transparency and little regulatory oversight, leaves them wondering just how much debt Americans are actually getting into.\n\nDuring last year’s holiday shopping season, Adobe said that BNPL usage “hit an all-time high,” raking in more than $18 billion in online spending — growing nearly 10% compared to the same time period a year earlier. The option is particularly attractive to younger, cash-strapped consumers who are looking to make their paycheck stretch further.\n\nTo make money, the BNPL providers charge merchants between 1.5% to 7% of the transaction price, according to Kansas City Federal Reserve research. For some retailers, the costs are worth it, according to research from RBC Capital Markets, which showed online BNPL offerings boosted average ticket sales by 30% to 50% and increase the share of customers who ultimately made a purchase.\n\nAmericans have found themselves in more and more debt recently. In the fourth quarter of last year, overall debt levels increased by 0.5% to $18.04 trillion, according to the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThat report also found that the share of households becoming seriously delinquent (a missed payment for 90+ days) on their auto loans and credit cards is at 14-year highs.\n\nThe partnership with DoorDash comes as Klarna continues to expands its offerings ahead of going public with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange in the coming weeks. The Swedish fintech company reported last week a 24% surge in 2024 revenue, cashing in on the BNPL craze, which is projected to surpass $160 billion over the next seven years.\n\nIn addition to food delivery, DoorDash also lets people buy large ticket items through third-party merchants, like Best Buy and the Home Depot.",

But what does this mean for their long-term health? Sanjay sits down with Dr. Cara Natterson , a pediatrician and expert on adolescent health, to discuss the implications of early puberty, what's driving the shift, and what anyone with a young person in their life needs to know to navigate this crucial time.\n\nDownload Transcript Episode Transcript\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:00:00 You know, I have to tell you, as a parent, something I think about a lot is how to have real, authentic conversations with my three teenage daughters. It can be hard sometimes. I realize that things are different for their generation. They have smartphones and screens and influencers. There is news that is constantly blaring everywhere. It's a different time. And a lot has changed right down to our biology. Take, for instance, puberty. It's one of the most awkward and yet important stages of growing up. But even that has changed. The average start of puberty in the United States now begins at eight years old for girls and nine for boys. Some kids are going through puberty even earlier than that. It also last much longer than it did before. For some people, puberty can last for up to a decade. Just think about that. All of this might come as a surprise to you.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:00:58 People know a lot about the puberty they went through, but it is not the same now.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:01:05 That's doctor Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and she's a parent. She's author of the New York Times bestselling series for girls called The Care and Keeping of You. She also has a sequel for boys called Guy stuff. She's an expert on puberty, so I decided to sit down to talk to her and try and learn. Why are kids going through puberty earlier, and is that early puberty really the new norm? I think most importantly for me, as a dad of three teenage girls, what do parents need to know about how to help their children navigate it? I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, and this is chasing life. So if you're a parent and I'm just guessing we're around the same age because I know you have two college athletes who are teenagers still, I think, or maybe early 20s, and I have three teenagers. So right around that same age, the way that we think about puberty is parents. But even I think as physicians may be totally different than than what our kids are going through. You're a pediatrician, so you obviously have updated knowledge, but for me, as just a dad, it's a totally different thing compared to 30, 40, 50 years ago.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:02:25 Even up until the late 1990s, we were all taught in medical school that puberty begins around 11 or 11.5 and it takes about two, three, four years. It's a sprint and you get through it and it's super awkward and your body changes and then you're done. That was sort of the teaching and the medical school more detailed teaching was not a whole lot more detailed. It was that the path through puberty were these stages called the Tanner stages. And Tanner looked at breast development. He looked at penile and testicular growth, and he looked at hair growth. And he did these studies in the 1940s and 50s and 60s. In an orphanage outside of London. And that's where he collected all of his data. So five stages, Tanner one. Nothing's happening. You're not in it. Tanner five, you're totally done. And two, three and four. That's puberty. Girls go into puberty around age 11. They're earlier kids or later kids. But that was about it. And boys around 11.5 now. And we started to get this knowledge in the late 1990s, when a study was published by a doctor of public health named Marsha Herman Giddens. She published a study, 17,000 girls, that showed, nope, it's not 11 anymore. It's ten. And in fact, if you looked at kids according to their race, kids who are black. Their average age of pubertal onset was even earlier, and we could talk about that study and what that did, but that really rocked the world. And that was more than 25 years ago, by the way. And then more data came out. And Louise Greenspan, with others, published data in 2010 that looked to confirm that original data. And it didn't just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further. So starting in 2010, right, 14 years ago, we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country. And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening. I did not know it was happening in my own house, because it's when boys tend to get private, but that average age is between 9 and 10. So that's different. That's two years different from when we were growing up.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:04:57 So 11, 11.5 was what the onset of puberty. That's the age that we all sort of learned, at least when we were in medical school. And now it's become younger, maybe even as young as eight. Is that normal puberty now or is that considered early onset puberty or early puberty? How do you refer to it?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:05:18 I love this question because I think definition of terms is the most important starting place. Right. So 8 to 9 is an average. Normal can be earlier than eight for some groups of girls. So as a pediatrician, when I was starting in practice in the year 2000, if a kid had secondary sex characteristics, if their bodies were starting to change, usually it meant breast development. And it happened before age eight. They would come into my office to see me. That was considered atypical or abnormal. Now that post has moved back to seven. So if a kid is younger than seven, they'll come see a pediatrician. But if they're over seven. Most advice is that is within the normal range. Oh, and by the way, if they're 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal. So now wrap your brain around a 5 or 6 year spread of normal onset of body changes. That's really hard for everyone to manage. And I'll add one more term that's really important. So puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation. So when you start puberty. You cannot be part of a baby making equation, and when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby. That's the definition of puberty very narrowly. The broader definition, as we talked about earlier, is all the other downstream shifts from all of those sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone floating around the body in the brain? Mood swings, friendships shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:07:21 I think the point is puberty isn't always straightforward. Things that seem like puberty, using that narrow definition might technically not be puberty.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:07:32 There's this thing called adrenarche that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEA s, and these hormones are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. Nostrum. And when the adrenal glands release these hormones, these hormones tell the body to make more sweat and in certain places to make it with greasier thicker proteins and to sprout more hair. Some places it's new hair, some places the hair texture and color changes that sweat hair. You can imagine how body odor and pimples are related. Right? That is not puberty. That's called adrenarche. It happens around the same time as puberty. But in some kids it can happen much earlier. So a five year old can have pubic hair and they're not in puberty. Or a 15 year old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness, and no pubic hair growth. It's confusing.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:08:47 Adrenarche and puberty can be totally disparate in terms of is there a relationship at all between. Yes. I mean.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:08:53 Yes, because the hormones are all cousins and they can convert forms. So DHEA and DHEAS can convert into testosterone and forms of estrogen. I should add, people always ask about where body weight fits in. And the answer to that is in many bodies that carry extra weight, they have what what's called peripheral conversion of these hormones. So DHEA and DHEAS when they're floating around, the body can convert more easily into the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone when there's more body fat, which is one of the bridges that connects this, which is one of the reasons why kids who carry extra body weight tip into puberty, typically a little earlier.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:09:45 This is fascinating. And I mean, the question I think a lot of people will ask which are which are addressing here is, is why over the last 30, 40 or 50 years, has puberty become something that is happening younger and younger? I, you know, again, this is just me, me talking here. I had heard about high body weight being a concern because of, as you say, what the added fat might do. I had also heard about potential environmental factors playing a role here, and I'm curious what what your thoughts are on that. But this idea of stress hormones, you know, I think of stress hormones as sort of short acting hormones. The idea that sort of a persistent exposure to high levels, for example, of cortisol, could also be a culprit in tipping people into puberty earlier. I had not considered that.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:10:37 Yeah. So the cortisol is for sure a short acting hormone. But when your adrenal glands are pumping it out 24 over seven. Because you're on social media reacting to what you're seeing, or because you're living in a stressful environment where you're expected to be an academic achiever or an athletic achiever, or if you're living in a stressful environment because you don't know where your next meal is coming from, or you don't know where you're going to sleep that night. So all of these things are what we call stressors. And by the way, there's no value judgment to be placed on which stressor is more or less important. But now you can see why every kid is exposed to stress, quote unquote stress, right? We love to throw around that term. What does it mean? It means anything that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol. And the stressors are there all the time. They're there all the time. When we went to school, we came home at the end of the day, and any dynamic that happened at school was left at school. Maybe someone called us on the corded phone and maybe one of our siblings. Let us take the call. Otherwise they were busy on the corded phone. Right now there is round the clock. Social dynamics. Romantic dynamics. Right. But I don't want to demonize this either. I think it's really, really important to be level about all this. I mean, social media, for instance. For sure. There's a connection here. But social media has also been shown to save lives, to build community for people who are marginalized and don't have it. It's too easy to be black and white about this. And so I think it's very important for us to recognize the role of stress and stressors, but also to recognize that some of the things we call stressors have huge upsides and huge positive benefits. I would never argue that the aces, the adverse childhood experiences that cause stress like food insecurity, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, witnessing violence, living in a traumatic situation. There is no upside to any of those stressors, but a lot of these sort of stressors in lives that are less challenged by ACS have positives and negatives.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:13:07 Stress in and of itself is not the enemy. It's the relentless nature of stress, I guess, is what I'm hearing you say.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:13:14 But I don't want to send people, you know, sort of screaming for the hills and stressed out because it is not a switch which goes from 0 to 100. With puberty. When we were growing up, the path for puberty was fast. Today, even though it's starting earlier, it is actually happening more slowly. So it's not like an eight year old wakes up one morning in the body of an 18 year old. It is not what's happening. What is happening is eight year olds. If their girls might be developing breast buds, they might just have breast buds for a while. It is not like they are going to have their full adult breast size immediately. And this is another thing that is layering sort of the confusion and the, the, the sense of I don't know how to help the kid in my life. Parents don't know how seriously to take any of this. And there's worry. I mean, it's just it's a mess. It's a mess of information that is so easily remedied with just some simple facts. So fact one puberty is starting earlier. Fact two it's going slower. It's going slower. Girls are getting their period a little bit earlier than they used to, but not three years earlier. It's more like somewhere between 3 and 6 months.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:14:42 What about the racial divide? So when you take all these factors that could potentially be causing puberty to happen sooner. Why? Why racial divide?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:14:51 'Every researcher that I trust is landing at the same conclusion, which it's going to turn out not to be race. It's going to turn out to be zip code. So if you take this explanation of cortisol being at the heart of everything that's going on, and you look at the way this country sets up and the socioeconomic divide and the racial divide, it's you can't argue that the two are not completely overlapped. It's a very, very hard to look at the sociological data and say, oh, yes, we can account for racial shifts in puberty separate from zip code, socioeconomic shifts and puberty. So it's kids who are more stressed and more under-resourced, who are entering puberty the soonest. Now everyone's entering sooner. On average, the trend line is down because of something you mentioned earlier, which is these amorphous environmental causes. So the way I would describe that bucket is everything we put into and onto our body is impacting our body. Right? So it's everything from the toiletries, the cosmetics that we use, the shampoos and cleansers and moisturizers. Many, many, many of them contain chemicals in them that disrupt the hormones in our body. They change the way hormones signal. Likewise, the pollution in the air that we breathe impacts the way our bodies work, right? Everything. The water we're drinking, depending upon what's in the food we're eating, what's, you know, antibiotics that are pumped into animals that then end up on grocery shelves. There's tons of data that shows that those antibiotics shift the way our body's immune system works are inflammatory cascade. We have inflammation as a result that has impacts on the sex hormones. So it's a lot of things coming at us. But it's a reminder that there are some really incredible scientists out there who are trying to figure out what are these lowest common denominator chemicals that are showing up in these various environmental insults. We call them insults, right, that are changing the way the hormones work in our body so that we can get rid of them. And that's really important. And right now, the foods that don't have antibiotics are the toiletries Cosmetics that don't have a whole list of chemical ingredients tend to be more expensive. Right? So right. We're back to zip code. We're back to the socioeconomic drivers of puberty. So it's complicated.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:17:35 If you look at the data around the world, do you see differences geographically, by country or culture?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:17:42 Yes. So net net puberty everywhere is starting earlier. And we've known this for a long time. And even in very remote areas we know that puberty is starting earlier. So that's that sort of global phenomenon of what people are putting into an onto their bodies and how chemicals are shifting the path through puberty. But it looks different from country to country and region to region. And the data is kind of all over the map. And in the US we tend to be a little bit on the earlier side. So the data shows our average start of puberty has been consistently at or below the average for the world.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:18:29 So puberty happening earlier isn't just a thing happening in the United States. This is a global phenomenon. But I think the real question then is just how worried should we be about kids starting to develop earlier in life? And if we are worried, when then should we as parents get involved? We'll be right back. When we talk about blue zones and things like that, places where people live better, they live longer lives, they have more social connection. You can see the benefit, and the benefit usually is something like longevity. You live longer, you have a higher health span, things like that. The question that I really sort of struggle with when it comes to puberty is, is puberty starting earlier a bad thing?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:19:21 We have no idea. I mean, because we have no data, right? So people ask this all the time, and the answer is we only have about 25, 26 years of evidence that puberty is really started to march earlier. And so the oldest of those kids are just in middle age now, right, entering middle age. So we don't know. But what we do know is there have been trends through history of when puberty has started earlier, when puberty has started later. We are so sure that earlier puberty is bad. And yet really, if you look back through the lens of history in cultures or in societies where there was no food available, what did those kids bodies do? Their bodies slowed down their development and puberty happened much later, and it makes great evolutionary sense. The whole point of puberty is to be able to be part of a baby making equation. If your body, if you are a female and your body cannot carry a fetus because you're so nutritionally deprived. You don't have the food you need. You don't have the nutritional resources. Well, then why would the body try to develop and get itself there in order to reproduce quickly? There's no rush. So there are times where you look through historical records, and the average age of pubertal onset is 16. And that's because in those societies there was a famine. And so I'm not saying earlier puberty is good. I think we have to put everything in context.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:21:02 But just in terms of mental health risks. I've been reading some about this and how girls starting puberty earlier might come with added mental health risks. Is there evidence of that then? And do we know anything for boys as well?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:21:15 So for girls, the data is pretty clear and it tethers to this early data about earlier puberty, earlier body changes, more sexualization, earlier risk for predation. If your body is changing. No one's talking to you about it, or the world thinks it's happening to you. Too young. So you're not getting informed in a certain way. But then the world is sexualizing you and expects for you to either think like you're older because you look like you're older, or to behave like you're older because you look like you're older. The set up for mental health issues is tremendous, right? Also, the sex hormones, whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty, they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed. You know, Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line. It is absolutely true. And that is where third and fourth grade parents are like, wow, my kid is in puberty. They are slamming the door. I mean, that is all those hormones rising and falling and and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts. It has to be a set up for mental health issues if we are not talking about it. I will add for boys, there has been no study that looks at testosterone and quiet, but I am 100% convinced that when someone finally studies it, we will see that testosterone surges and drops are what cause the silence of tween and teen boys. We know testosterone causes rage, but the other side of that pendulum swing is silence. And it's not that they don't talk, but they talk less. And then they are rewarded for talking less or. Today's generation of parents goes well that was what I did. And I just shut my door for three years and my parents didn't say anything and was totally fine. And I emerged out the other end, and I'm okay. And that the truth is that was then. This is now that sign that you see in boys where they just become monosyllabic or grunts. It is painful for parents, it is hormonal and there are ways through it. There are conversations you can have with your boys. There are ways to pull them out of their shell. They do emerge out the other side, but they do want to be talked to. I swear. They tell us all the time, just because they're not talking a lot, doesn't mean that they don't want to be included in the conversation.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:24:06 This is so fascinating. I mean, I think anyone listening, myself included, is thinking about those teens in their life, whether their own kids or kids friends. And it tracks. It's so interesting. I mean, it's fascinating. Let me ask you this. So if parents come to you and say that my kid seems to be going through puberty very early. What is the conversation that you'd have with parents?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:24:29 So let's start with this thing. Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider. This is really important. What they need to do is they need to have a conversation, and then they need to do a physical exam, and they need to actually look at your kid. I am a pediatrician. I did not examine my own child. I did not know when my son went into puberty, but it was not my job to be his pediatrician and to examine him and to determine that. So I would take him in for his annual checkup, and if there were any concerns in between, I would take him in. And it was the pediatrician who had the conversation with him and examined him, and then I could pick up the conversation from their. Pediatricians are trained to ask parents to leave the room. By the time a kid is about somewhere 11, 12, 13, 14, they're going to kick the parent out at some point. That's totally appropriate. Then call him up, ask him, or at the end of the visit, pull him aside. Hey, is my kid in puberty or do I need to worry about anything? There are so many ways into the conversation, but hopefully the theme here is coming through that talking about it is the most important thing.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:25:54 Puberty can on average starts around 8 or 9, but it can be 6 or 7, you said. So I have a kid. I think they may be going through puberty at a very young age. Should I be worried about that?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:26:07 So before age seven, for a girl, before age eight for a boy, I would say you would want to bring in medical advice. You start seeing changes in the body. You want to bring in a medical finger, but you noticed I'm not using the word concerned or worried because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren't puberty.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:26:33 But if it is happening before that age, what would the pediatrician be thinking?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:26:37 They're looking for what's called precocious puberty. And precocious puberty is puberty that's happening sooner than it should. And one of the causes of precocious puberty, which is not common, but it's always on the list for every pediatrician, is a tumor that is growing in the brain, that is telling the brain to secrete the hormones called LA and FSH, that tip the body into starting puberty. That's the main thing that people are looking for. It's a tumor that is causing the hormones to release early. But I hesitate to go down that road because more often than not, the concerns turn out to be not a worry, but a great opportunity for conversation with the pediatrician, right? So, for instance, if you have a kid who's carrying extra body weight and you think they're developing breasts and actually it's just fat tissue, and a doctor can examine them and show that it's just fat tissue and there's no breast tissue, it's still a great opportunity for a conversation about nutritional wellness.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:27:43 Right? Right. But what what are some of the approaches that you've implemented as a parent, with all you've known when it comes to talking about puberty?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:27:53 The best tip I have is what I did with my son, so that my oldest is her daughter, who is just a talker. But my son was not a talker. And when he went through puberty, he became really not a talker. And that was very hard for me. So the first thing I learned how to do was to sit on the other side of a closed door. So I would sit on the other side of my son's door and I would knock on the door and I would say, hey, buddy, I'm actually just sitting on the other side of the door, and I would really love to hear what's going on, and I'm going to be here for about 5 or 10 minutes. And if you want to talk, I'm just happy to sit here and talk. And it's so funny we did. My partner Vanessa and I did a podcast episode with our two sons who were going off to college this month, and there's a part of the podcast where I talk about this with my son, and I'm like, do you remember this? And he's of course, I remember it because it worked. We didn't have to look at each other. We didn't have to. There was no vulnerability. I wasn't there was no worry, you know? He was so aware of me being worried about everything right then. And there was none of that with a closed door between us. And then eventually the door opened. And then my strategy became. And it is still to this day, my strategy. Knock on the door. Always knock. Go in. He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I'd be like, hey, then how you doing? And he'd start talking. No eye contact, but my laying on his bed and him sitting in his desk, at his desk, with his back to me, was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations. That is a way of communicating with a kid that works. Everyone says do it in the car. Car is great on a walk. On a walk is great. You're just not making eye contact. So that's what worked for me, and I hope that other people can take that advice, because the parents who taught me that I'm forever grateful.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:30:03 I get to tell you another piece of crucial advice is to just start having these conversations. Just start talking. Have the conversations. The big ones, the small ones, the silly ones, the serious ones. Because you gotta know this. In this day and age, our kids are exposed to a lot early, and some of what they're exposed to, like it or not, is not what any parent would want.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:30:26 The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12. Really? Yeah. Wow. And 15% of ten year olds have seen it. So if you're not having conversations like this about all of this smells and feelings and sex and all of it, if you're not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is. So it's time to get over the awkwardness. Educate yourself. Find your own trusted adult. We always tell kids to find a trusted adult. Adult find your own trusted adult, you know, bounce things off of them, but start having these conversations. They can be short. You can have many of them over many years. You will mess them up, I promise you. That's okay. Take a do over. Come back and say to your kid, you know what? I said that wrong. I want to try again. But it's really, really critical to know that there are information resources out there for them that compete with you. And if you want to be the source of information, it's up to you to do it.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe pilots of a Boeing 737 started to mistakenly take off from a taxiway at a Florida airport on Thursday before an air traffic controller told them to stop, the Federal Aviation Administration said, announcing it was investigating the incident.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Flight 3278 was cleared to take off on a runway at Orlando International Airport, bound for Albany, New York, the FAA said in a statement. The plane, however, started to accelerate on a parallel taxiway instead, prompting an air traffic controller to cancel the takeoff clearance.\n\nTaxiways are used by planes to travel between gates and runways, but are not intended for take offs or landings.\n\nThe aircraft’s top speed was 70 knots at the time, or approximately 80 mph, according to flight data tracker FlightRadar24. Airplanes typically travel about 35 mph on taxiways. A Boeing 737 would need to accelerate to about 150 mph for takeoff.\n\n“The crew mistook the surface for the nearby runway,” the airline said in a statement. “Southwest is engaged with the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) and FAA to understand the circumstances of the event.”\n\nThe 737 stopped safely and no other aircraft were involved, Southwest said. The airline later flew the passengers to Albany on a different plane.\n\nThursday’s episode comes after a series of incidents in recent weeks, including near misses, crash landings and accidents, including the fatal collision of an American Airlines plane and a US Army helicopter in Washington, DC.\n\nOn Wednesday the NTSB released a report on the February 6 crash of a Bering Air regional flight in Alaska, which killed all 10 people onboard. According to the NTSB, the Cessna Grand Caravan was overweight before it took off. The plane was initially reported missing but was found the next day on ice floating in Alaska’s Norton Sound.\n\nAnd on Thursday Canada’s Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report on a February 17 incident that saw a Delta Air Lines regional jet flipping over as it landed at Toronto Pearson International Airport.\n\nPassengers were left “hanging like bats” but all 80 on board - passengers and crew - survived.\n\nOn February 25, Southwest Flight 2504, from Omaha, was landing on Chicago Midway Airport’s runway 31C when a private Bombardier Challenger 350 crossed the runway in front of it.\n\nThe pilots of the private jet told investigators they thought they were in the right place and crossing a different runway at the time of the incident, according to a preliminary report released by the NTSB.\n\nAt their closest point, the two plane’s GPS antennas were separated by about 200 feet, the NTSB reports.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nHamas says it is considering the latest US ceasefire plan for Gaza and remains “fully engaged” in the mediation process as Israel vowed to escalate its renewed campaign in Gaza to pressure the militants into releasing hostages.\n\nThe shaky truce collapsed on Tuesday when Israel bombarded Gaza, shattering two months of calm that also saw dozens of hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Hamas said it was continuing to deliberate on a proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, who has suggested extending the first phase of the ceasefire-hostage deal through early April.\n\nHamas has insisted on sticking to a timeline previously agreed with Israel and the US that would move the warring parties into a second phase of the truce, in which Israel would commit to ending the war. But Israel has refused, saying it wants to extend the first phase instead.\n\nKhaled Meshaal, a senior Hamas official, on Thursday accused Israel of using the Witkoff plan “to blackmail Hamas by retrieving the (hostages) from the first phase of the agreement without committing to the obligations of the second phase, which include a lasting calm and full withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip.”\n\nThe ceasefire ended earlier this week as Israel resumed its air and ground campaign in Gaza, citing Hamas’ refusal to agree to the new terms. It has warned that it plans to significantly intensify military operations as well as pressure on civilians.\n\nIsraeli fire has killed nearly 600 people and injured more than a thousand in Gaza since the fighting resumed, according to the Hamas-run Government Media Office. Hamas fired rockets into Israel Thursday for the first time since the truce collapsed, but no casualties were reported.\n\nThe United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, said the reported number of children killed on Wednesday marked “one of the largest single-day child death toll in the last year.”\n\nThe Israeli military said Thursday that it began a ground operation in southern Gaza’s Rafah city. The city’s municipality reported Friday that more than 100 civilians had been killed under bombardment – most of them children and women. It said residents were being forcibly driven into the open, with no shelter or food.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Friday instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to seize more Gaza territory and evacuate its residents until Hamas releases all hostages, warning that the seizures would be “permanent.”\n\nThe move, he explained, would “expand the security zones around Gaza for the protection of Israeli communities and IDF soldiers through permanent maintenance of the territory by Israel.”\n\n“The more Hamas continues its refusal, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz added.\n\n‘Civilian means of pressure’\n\nHe also warned that “civilian means of pressure” will be adopted along with military pressure, “including evacuating the Gaza population to the south and implementing US President Trump’s voluntary transfer plan for Gaza residents.”\n\nSmoke billows behind a cemetery during Israeli strikes west of Gaza City on Tuesday.

Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn its statement on Friday, Hamas reiterated its demand for a permanent end to the war, saying it was exploring “various ideas on the table in a manner that aims to achieve a prisoner exchange deal that ensures the release of detainees, ends the war, and secures a withdrawal.”\n\nThe proposal from Witkoff last week would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a month-long extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, CNN has reported.\n\n‘An isolationist policy’\n\nUnder the proposal, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly three weeks.\n\nThe ceasefire extension would run until the end of Passover, extending the pause in fighting and renewing the entry of humanitarian aid through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday.\n\nKatz said Israel accepted Witkoff’s formula for the release of all the hostages, “both living and dead, in advance and in two stages with a ceasefire in between - without endangering Israeli security interests.”\n\nOf the 59 hostages still being held in Gaza, fewer than half are still believed to be alive.\n\nAsked by CNN whether Israel appears to be willing to return to the negotiating table, Egyptian foreign ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf said: “It doesn’t, and I think it’s an isolationist policy and runs diametrically opposed to what the global community would like to see… an end to this war.”\n\nEgypt had no indication that Israel was going to breach the Gaza ceasefire when Israeli negotiators were in Cairo on Sunday, just two days before Israel renewed attacks, Khallaf told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview on Thursday.\n\n“We have not been receiving these indications. We were engaged in ceasefire talks in order to move forward with phase two and phase three,” he said, calling Israel’s return to war a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement “that will trigger ripple effects.”\n\nEgypt continues to engage with the Trump administration on its efforts to resuscitate the ceasefire, he added.\n\nAfter the Trump administration initially cast doubt on the Egyptian-led plan, Khallaf said conversations with Witkoff have been constructive.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge will come face-to-face with Justice Department attorneys Friday in the wake of President Donald Trump’s call for his impeachment over how the jurist has handled a challenge to Trump’s use of a sweeping wartime authority to quickly deport some noncitizens.\n\nThe hearing before US District Judge James Boasberg comes as the he navigates a high-profile showdown with the administration over his orders last weekend that temporarily blocked Trump’s ability to use the Alien Enemies Act – and probes whether the administration immediately flouted those rulings with deportation flights Saturday night.\n\nBoasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama and the chief judge of the trial-level court in Washington, DC, has become emblematic of the scores of district court judges who have frustrated – even on a temporary basis – Trump’s agenda during the opening months of his second term.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump even echoed calls for Boasberg’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on the threat.\n\nBoasberg’s frustration with the department spilled further into open view on Thursday after he lambasted it for giving him “woefully insufficient” information in response to his request for more details about the deportations in question.\n\n“The Government again evaded its obligations,” the judge wrote. He went on to criticize DOJ for giving him a sworn statement by an official with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations who “repeated the same general information about the flights” and went on to say that Cabinet secretaries “‘are currently actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets privilege over the other facts requested by the Court’s order.’”\n\n“The Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege; indeed, his declaration on that point, not surprisingly, is based solely on his unsubstantiated ‘understand[ing],’” he added.\n\nCritically, Boasberg, in an escalation of the standoff with DOJ, ordered its attorneys to “show cause” as to how two deportation flights it allowed to continue last Saturday did not violate orders he issued that day temporarily blocking Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport individuals the government has accused of being affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe judge had ordered all planes carrying migrants being deported under the act to turn around immediately pending a legal challenge brought the American Civil Liberties Union and others to Trump’s use of the 18th century law.\n\nBut the ACLU lawyers quickly accused the administration of flouting his commands. The Justice Department has repeatedly insisted it did not violate the orders last weekend.\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk over the last seven weeks about constitutional crisis. People are throwing that term around. I think we are getting very close to it,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told Boasberg earlier this week.\n\nThe Justice Department has already appealed Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but they’ve also asked the judge to completely wipe them away – a request he’s hearing arguments over during the Friday afternoon hearing.\n\nOn TV and social media as well as in court papers, Trump administration officials have pushed a range of arguments for why they believe the judge exceeded his authority in issuing the orders, including that Trump’s use of AEA is shielded from any review by federal courts.\n\n“We have one unelected federal judge trying to control foreign policies, trying to control the Alien Enemies Act, which they have no business presiding over. And there are 261 reasons why Americans are safer now – that’s because those people are out of this country,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday on Fox News.\n\nBoasberg, Bondi maintained, is symbolic of the Trump administration’s defeats in court.\n\n“This has been a pattern with these liberal judges,” she said. “This judge had no right to do that. They are meddling in foreign affairs, they are meddling in our government, and the question should be why is a judge trying to protect terrorists who have invaded our country over American citizens.”",

The captain told us of the fire in Hayes and we all immediately went online to see what we could find out.\n\nAnd then the time just started passing. Babies cried; coffee was served. Every half an hour or so the captain would make an announcement telling us about the latest situation in London: meetings were being held; planes were being diverted. He was trying to get more information.\n\nThose of us who were in business class were able to recline and get a bit of sleep, and we kept waiting and waiting for more information. The captain told us that we burned off fuel with the auxiliary power unit and we wouldn’t have enough to get to London anyway, so he topped up the tanks and then we waited a bit more.\n\nFinally, at 4 a.m. he told us the flight was canceled and that we would be bussed back. Hotels were being arranged. immigration in São Paulo was quick and to the point; no one seemed to want to ask any questions.\n\nThe bags are going round the carousel.

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nYurliana Andreina Chacin Gómez gripped her cellphone, her three-year old daughter clinging on, as the voice of a federal official boomed through the phone.\n\n“He’s been removed,” the official confirmed, as Chacin Gómez – with CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez translating – asked about the whereabouts of her brother, a Venezuelan national who’s been in US custody. And then, the answer she had been desperate for.\n\nHer brother, Jhon Willian Chacin Gómez, had been sent to El Salvador.\n\nOvercome with grief, Chacin Gómez collapsed on the couch with her family.\n\nFor four days, Chacin Gómez had been searching for her brother after spotting him in a handout video from the El Salvadoran government as among those sent to El Salvador from the United States, accused by the Trump administration of having ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\n“He’s not a criminal,” she cried in Spanish.\n\nChacin Gómez’s story is, in many ways, consistent with those of multiple family members and immigration attorneys who spoke with CNN – Venezuelan migrants detained in the US, suddenly disappearing from the US federal system, and leaving families and attorneys scrambling to find them.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for a list of those moved to El Salvador and requested comment from Immigration and Customs Enforcement multiple times in the case of Chacin Gómez’s brother. CNN also asked ICE for information about the cases of other deportees in this story, and reached out to agencies in Venezuela and El Salvador to seek out details about them.\n\nThe deportations stem from President Donald Trump’s invocation of a sweeping wartime authority that paved the way for the swift removal of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which has agreed to take migrants from the United States. The administration said 137 of those immigrants were deported pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDespite the high-level accusations levied by the Trump administration that the deportees were affiliated with Tren de Aragua, it has not provided evidence on a case-by-case level, and CNN has not been able to confirm whether any of the deported migrants identified in this story have any affiliation to the gang.\n\n“I’ve been representing people in immigration court for 15 years and my organization represents thousands of people every year. This is the most shocking thing I’ve ever seen happen to one of our clients,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, co-founder and president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, who is representing a different Venezuelan asylum seeker they say was abruptly removed to El Salvador over the weekend.\n\nThis handout image obtained on March 16 from El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office shows Salvadoran police officers escorting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Cecot prison. El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office/Handout/Reuters\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act, an obscure 18th-century law, has only been invoked three times in US history, all during major military conflicts. Detentions and deportations that occur under the measure do not go through the immigration court system, which provides immigrants the chance to seek relief and make their case to stay in the country.\n\nNow that they’re in El Salvador, it’s unclear what legal recourse, if any, those migrants have—they are no longer in US custody, nor in their origin country. US officials say it will ultimately be up to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele what happens to them next.\n\nBukele said the migrant arrivals, who the Trump administration has accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, will remain “for a period of one year” in the Center for Terrorism Confinement. Known as Cecot, it’s the largest prison in the Americas and is infamous for its harsh conditions. (In response to a CNN inquiry, the Salvadoran government said it respects the human rights of those in custody “without distinction of nationality” and insisted that its prison system meets standards of safety and order.)\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly teased invoking the 1798 law, saying in October that he wanted to use the measure because “it gives tremendous authority to everybody to straighten out our country.”\n\nTrump has often cited Tren de Aragua, which began as a prison gang in Venezuela. Much of their criminal enterprise has been focused “on human smuggling and other illicit acts that target desperate migrants,” according to the US Treasury Department. The full scale of its operations is unknown. The Trump administration has acknowledged in court documents that many of the deportees it accuses of being Tren de Aragua members don’t have criminal records in the US.\n\nThe US recently designated Tren de Aragua, among other gangs and drug cartels, as a foreign terrorist organization, paving the way to tougher financial penalties and legal ramifications in the US against those involved. That designation also served as a basis for invoking the Alien Enemies Act, as US officials have claimed that the country is under “invasion” by the gang at the direction of a foreign government, Venezuela.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has decried what he called the “kidnapping” of Venezuelan migrants who were sent to El Salvador and denied that the migrants were criminals.\n\nThis handout image obtained on March 16 from El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office shows Salvadoran police officers escorting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Cecot prison. El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office/Handout/Reuters\n\n‘He’s my other half’\n\nJhon Willian Chacin Gómez, a tattoo artist from Venezuela, crossed into the United States with his sister, Yurliana, last year. While Yurliana was able to stay in the US with her daughter to pursue her asylum claim, Jhon Willian was returned to Mexico, she says. He later requested an appointment through the CBP One app, which allowed migrants to set up appointments to legally enter the United States to request asylum.\n\nHe arrived for that appointment at the California-Mexico border last October and was detained. While in detention, Jhon Willian tried to find a legal pathway to remain in the United States, but his sister says he was denied.\n\nThe two of them jumped on phone calls and video calls daily, sometimes multiple times a day, to connect. “When I saw him on video calls, I would see his innocence,” she said. “He would say, ‘I’ll wait as long as I have to here until we can reunite.’”\n\nWhile in detention, her brother had also shared that ICE was investigating him because of his tattoos and asked whether he was associated with Tren de Aragua, which he denied. He welcomed the investigation, Yurliana said, and later told his sister that ICE had confirmed that he was not associated with the gang.\n\nIn early March, Jhon Willian was transferred to Texas, without explanation. By then, his sister says, he had started to become more anxious, hoping to either be released or returned to Venezuela. Last Friday, in the last call between the two of them, Jhon Willian shared that there had been movements at the facility where he was being held with other Venezuelans, and he believed his deportation to be imminent.\n\nShe never heard from him after that. His name disappeared from the ICE locator and the apps she had used to communicate with him while in detention.\n\nOn Sunday, Yurliana learned that flights had arrived in El Salvador. “I began to feel suspicious because there wasn’t news of any other planes arriving elsewhere,” she said.\n\nYurliana Andreina Chacin Gómez looks at a photo of her brother. Shelby Tauber for CNN\n\nA day later, while furiously texting with family to try to locate her brother, the news played in the background on her television. As she watched videos of migrants arriving in El Salvador pop up on her screen, she spotted who she believed to be her brother. The images were blurry, but she could identify his tattoos, glasses and recognized his posture.\n\n“It was emotional,” she said. “I don’t know if he’s okay, if he’s eating, how he’s sleeping. He must be nervous and scared.”\n\nFour days later, she received confirmation from DHS that he had been sent to El Salvador. Her only way of getting in touch with him now—by going through channels in El Salvador.\n\n“He knows how much I love him. He’s my other half,” she said. “My heart is broken.”\n\nA deported singer\n\nAlso among those believed to be detained in El Salvador is Arturo Suarez Trejo, an up-and-coming Venezuelan singer.\n\nKnown by his stage name, SuarezVzla, Arturo is known for singing peaceful ballads and love songs. Arturo had been living with his pregnant wife in Chile, where he launched his career as an artist, according to his family. In September, he decided to migrate to the United States to advance that career and learn English, his brother Nelson told CNN. After setting up an appointment at a border entry point, he was allowed to enter the US while he completed a political asylum application, Nelson said.\n\n“My brother has no criminal records in Venezuela, Chile or even a traffic violation in the US,” Nelson said, sharing documents from the civil registry of Chile, the Venezuelan interior ministry and Colombia’s national police, which he says show Arturo has a clean record. CNN has reached out to all three agencies for comment.\n\nNelson said ICE detained Arturo and his manager during the filming of scenes for a music video in North Carolina on February 8, just days before he was scheduled to submit his fingerprints as part of his asylum application. Nelson noted that this brother has tattoos, though he says they’re not related to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nCNN has contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for details on his detention.\n\nArturo was later transferred to Georgia, where he was awaiting an immigration hearing to determine his status. Court records show his initial hearing was scheduled for April 2.\n\nHis family said they requested that he be released on bond but were told that it wasn’t an option because he hadn’t committed a crime. They also asked if he could leave the US voluntarily but did not receive a response, Nelson said. CNN has requested more information from ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\n\nArturo Suarez Trejo is seen in an undated photo. From Arturo Suarez Trejo/Facebook\n\nOn Friday, the last time the brothers spoke, Arturo said he was told that authorities would repatriate him to Venezuela, an update that thrilled his family, Nelson said.\n\nTo their shock, Arturo was apparently flown to El Salvador instead. His relatives say they found out only after the Salvadoran government posted photos of the deportees in prison on Sunday.\n\nThe family recognized Arturo in one of those pictures by his tattoos. One drawing inked on the left side of his neck shows a hummingbird. Another on his left leg depicts two faces leaning in for a kiss. The tattoos in the prison picture are similar to those in social media photos of Arturo that his brother and wife have shared.\n\nCNN has asked the Salvadorian government if it can confirm Arturo is being detained in Cecot but has not received a response.\n\n“My brother has tattoos because he’s an artist but that doesn’t make him a criminal,” Nelson said. “I’ve never seen him argue or be aggressive. He’s a person who’s beyond calm.”\n\nA lawyer’s scramble\n\nDetainees were abruptly moved from different parts of the United States to Texas days before their removal flights, according to relatives and attorneys who spoke with CNN.\n\nToczylowski’s client arrived in the United States last year through the CBP One app. The client, who Toczylowski didn’t name over concerns for his safety, was detained in California while he sought asylum on the basis of political persecution. He was moved to Texas in early March.\n\nLast Thursday, he was expected to appear virtually for his immigration hearing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, but he wasn’t there. The ICE prosecutor didn’t have information, according to Toczylowski, and the judge rescheduled the hearing to Monday.\n\nHis absence set off a race to collect information on his whereabouts, but his attorneys couldn’t find him in the US immigration detention system. DHS had previously filed pictures of his tattoos, alleging – as they have in other cases – that they were evidence he had ties to Tren de Aragua, adding to the alarm among his attorneys that he could be subject to the wartime authority. Toczylowski’s client denied that was the case.\n\n“We start hearing about the three planes (over the weekend),” Toczylowski said. “We were just watching, knowing that our client was likely on one of those flights.”\n\nOn Monday, ICE confirmed in immigration court that Toczylowski’s client had been among those sent to El Salvador – despite his ongoing asylum proceedings in the United States.\n\n“He came here seeking protection, seeking asylum and because of his tattoos which are the type of tattoos you would see on any person hanging out in a coffee shop in (Los Angeles). Because of those tattoos he’s in a labor prison in El Salvador known for human rights abuse,” Toczylowski said.\n\nThe removal of migrants to El Salvador “should be putting a chill down the spine of everyone,” she added.\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, executive director of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, speaks to the media outside St. Anthony Croatian Catholic Church in Los Angeles in June 2023. David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Carefully vetted’\n\nThe administration has not publicly identified those removed on Saturday’s flights to El Salvador. CNN previously reported that more than half of the 261 migrants expelled to El Salvador were done under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\n“We are not going to reveal operational details about a counter terrorism operation, but what I can assure you, as I said on Monday, we have the highest degree of confidence in our ICE agents and our Customs and Border Patrol agents who have committed their lives to targeting illegal criminals in our country, particularly foreign terrorists,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“They had great evidence and indication. They have the highest degree of professionalism, and they were 100 percent confident in the individuals that were sent home on these flights and in the president’s executive authority to do that,” she added.\n\nThe administration has similarly argued in court that they thoroughly vetted the migrants selected to be sent to El Salvador, arguing that they were “carefully vetted” through investigative techniques and a review of information to ensure they were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to a court declaration submitted this week from an agency official.\n\nRobert Cerna, acting field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, argued that the agency “did not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone,” instead using multiple methods to make determinations.\n\n“Members of TdA pose an extraordinary threat to the American public. TdA members are involved in illicit activity to invoke fear and supremacy in neighborhoods and with the general population,” the filing states.\n\nCerna noted that many of the TdA members did not have criminal records in the United States.\n\n“However, even though many of these TdA members have been in the United States only a short time, some have still managed to commit extremely serious crimes,” Cerna said, listing multiple charges and convictions against some of those removed.\n\nSalvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Cecot on March 16. El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office/Reuters\n\n‘Indeed, he is my son’\n\nAnother presumed detainee is Venezuelan national Francisco García Cacique. His mother, Mirelys Cacique, said on CNN en Español that she also recognized him in one of the photos of the inmates.\n\nShe said he was photographed from above as he was sitting next to other prisoners on the ground with his head down. Although his face was not visible, she’s “100% certain” it’s him based on his physical features, including his own distinctive tattoos.\n\n“I know his physiognomy, his body, his neck, his ears, and, indeed, he is my son,” Mirelys said.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm that Francisco García is the person in the image. CNN has contacted the US Department of Homeland Security and the Salvadoran Presidential Communications Secretariat to verify if García was among those deported this weekend but has not yet received a response.\n\nGarcía’s family denies that he’s affiliated with a gang. They claim he’s simply a migrant who entered the United States in 2023 and worked as a barber in Texas until his arrest in February. His mother acknowledged that her son was ordered to be deported after a judge issued a removal order in absentia when he failed to appear for a hearing.\n\nThe wife of another presumed detainee, Mervin José Yamarte Fernández, shared a similar story on CNN en Español.\n\nJaannelys Parra Morillo said her brother-in-law recognized her husband in one of the prison photos El Salvador published. She said he also has tattoos but insists he has no criminal record or ties to any criminal group.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm that Yamarte Fernández is among those detained in El Salvador and the Venezuelan government has not responded to inquiries on the matter, but Parra says there’s no doubt it’s him.\n\n“I’m sure about my husband. I know him well. I’ve been with him for 11 years. I know he’s not a bad guy,” she said. “He’s not a member of Tren de Aragua. He doesn’t like bad things. He likes soccer, he likes to work.”\n\nCNN’s Avery Schmitz and Max Saltman and CNNE’s Mauricio Torres and Osmary Hernández contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nSummary Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of US cancer deaths.\n\nExperts recommend screening for most adults beginning at age 45.\n\nRisk factors include obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use and diets high in red and processed meats.\n\nRegular doctor visits, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol, exercise and eating a healthy diet reduces risk\n\nTreatment options include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, and early detection improves prognosis.\n\nColorectal cancer stands as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in US men and the fourth leading cause in US women, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThis year, over 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with this cancer, and 52,900 will die from it, according to the organization’s estimates. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is estimated to be about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women.\n\nBecause March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness month, I wanted to speak to an expert about the risk factors for this type of cancer. How is it treated? When should people begin colorectal cancer screenings, and what types of tests are available? Who should start screening earlier? And what can people do to try to lower their risk of developing colorectal cancer?\n\nTo help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n\nCNN: What is colorectal cancer?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Colorectal cancer refers to colon cancer, which starts in the colon, and rectal cancer, which starts in the rectum. Sometimes, people refer to “colon cancer” and “colorectal cancer” interchangeably, but technically colon cancer is part of the broader category of colorectal cancer.\n\nDiet is one risk factor for colorectal cancer that can be controlled, specifically the amount of red meat and processed meat you eat. miodrag ignjatovic/E+/Getty Images\n\nCNN: What are the risk factors for colorectal cancer?\n\nWen: Risk factors for colorectal cancer are divided into ones associated with lifestyle, which therefore can be changed, and those that are not.\n\nIn terms of lifestyle risk factors, a major one is being overweight or obese. Another is having diabetes. Others include smoking, alcohol use and diets with a lot of red meats and processed meats.\n\nIn terms of risk factors not associated with lifestyle, inherited syndromes, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis, substantially increase colorectal cancer risk. People with inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, also are at elevated risk, as are those who have had radiation to the abdomen or pelvic area and individuals with a family history in a first-degree relative of colorectal cancer.\n\nYour age is also important. Colorectal cancer is far more common after age 50, though in recent years, there has been a rise in this cancer among younger people. In fact, the rate of colorectal cancer in people under 50 is expected to double by 2030, according to some estimates, and colorectal cancer is on track to being the leading cause of death for people ages 20 to 49.\n\nCNN: Why has there been a rise in colorectal cancer in younger people?\n\nWen: We don’t know the exact cause, and it probably involves several factors. Since obesity is a risk factor, increasing rates of obesity may account for some of the rise in colorectal cancer. Changes in dietary habits and increasingly sedentary lifestyles also may be associated with higher cancer risk. Environmental factors could play a role, too, for instance, cancer-causing chemicals in soil, water and food.\n\nCNN: How is colorectal cancer treated?\n\nWen: Treatment depends on multiple factors, including the stage of cancer and the person’s overall health. Surgery is the most common treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy are sometimes offered, too, and there are also targeted therapies, including immunotherapies that help a person’s immune system fight cancer.\n\nAs with other types of cancers, the prognosis is best if the cancer is localized and has not spread at the time it is diagnosed. That’s why screening is so important: to try to catch the cancer early.\n\nCNN: When should people begin colorectal cancer screenings, and what types of tests are available?\n\nWen: The US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended since 2021 that most adults 45 to 75 years old be screened for colorectal cancer. This represents a change from prior guidelines, which advised that screening begin at age 50. Between ages 76 and 85, the task force states that the screening decision should be an individual one made in consultation with one’s physician. The task force recommends discontinuing screening after age 85.\n\nSeveral types of approved methods exist for colorectal cancer screening. The first method is visual inspection of the colon. The gold standard of these tests is the colonoscopy. This procedure involves a gastroenterologist passing a long tube through the patient’s bowels, and it generally requires that the person is put under anesthesia during the procedure. A related procedure, called the sigmoidoscopy, is quicker and requires less sedation, but it results in a more limited view of the bowels. People can also receive a CT colonography, also called a virtual colonoscopy, to view the bowels through a scan.\n\nThe colonoscopy is generally recommended every 10 years. The sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography would be recommended every five years. The benefit of the colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy over the CT colonography is that if a precancerous polyp is seen, it could be removed during the procedure to prevent it from developing into cancer in the future.\n\nA second type of test is stool-based tests. Patients collect a stool sample at home and then send it to a lab to be analyzed. The test looks for certain things in the stool, such as blood or tumor DNA, that could suggest cancer. These tests need to be done every one to three years. If there is a concerning finding, the patient is generally recommended for a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy for further testing.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration approved another type of test in 2024. This blood test has an accuracy rate comparable to that of stool tests. I think it’s a good option for individuals who may otherwise not get colon cancer screenings. Indeed, according to the American Cancer Society, as many as 1 in 3 people who should get tested for colon cancer have never received any screening tests.\n\nCNN: Who should start screening earlier?\n\nWen: It’s important to note that the age of 45 to start screening is for adults at average risk of colon cancer.\n\nPeople who should begin screening at earlier ages are those at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer. Those people with genetic syndromes, for instance, inflammatory bowel disease, or personal or family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps may need to begin earlier and receive screening more frequently. People who have such personal or family history should discuss options with their provider.\n\nCNN: What can people do to try to lower their risk of developing colorectal cancer?\n\nWen: Everyone should regularly visit their primary care provider, at least once a year. This is the time to discuss screening recommendations that consider their personal and family cancer history.\n\nIt’s also the opportunity to discuss lifestyle-related risk factors that could be changed. Stopping smoking and reducing alcohol consumption can substantially reduce risk, as can receiving counsel on weight loss to treat obesity. Increasing physical activity and modifying diet to one with less red and processed meat and with more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fiber can help as well.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Downers Grove, Illinois CNN —\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have faced eruptions of anger at town hall meetings across the country this week, as constituents have coupled their fury over President Donald Trump’s actions with deep frustration over what they see as a feckless Democratic response.\n\nArizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego were told to “fight dirtier” and “get in the mud” with Republicans.\n\n“We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,” a man told Maryland Rep. Glenn Ivey.\n\n“They should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party,” an attendee groused to CNN at a town hall held by Illinois Rep. Sean Casten.\n\nThe sharp criticism from voters comes as Democrats are out of power across all levels of the federal government and lacking a clear leader, exposing deep divisions along ideological and tactical lines over the party’s direction. The schism emerging within the party on the heels of a contentious government funding fight has prevented the caucus from uniting behind a single strategy to counter Trump and attempt to make political inroads ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe tension between Democratic lawmakers and their voters spilled into public view days after the Republican-led House and Senate narrowly averted a shutdown by approving a short-term government spending measure — with the help of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine others in his caucus who cleared a pathway for the bill.\n\nEager to avoid embarrassment as Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk slash federal spending and remake the federal government, Republican leaders told the party’s House members not to hold town hall meetings during this week’s congressional recess.\n\nMost Republicans heeded those calls. Those who didn’t — Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood and Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, among them — faced heckling and pointed questions, including some from Republican voters, at their events.\n\nFlood was asked how he “personally stomachs” limiting funding for medical research after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nCarol Moseman, a Republican who voted for Flood, told CNN she doesn’t want Congress to give up its role as a check on the Trump administration.\n\n“I want to hear that he and other Republicans are going to stand up for democracy that they’re not going to let Mr. Trump take over using executive powers,” she said. “We voted for Congress to enact laws, and that’s not happening.”\n\nHageman faced concerns in her deep-red district over federal spending cuts and frozen grants. Kindergarten teacher Tomi Sue Wille said she supports Trump’s push to dismantle the Department of Education but worries that crucial federal funding for special needs children won’t reach her students.\n\n“I do believe that Congress needs to take some control in making sure how that funding is still distributed to the states,” Wille told CNN.\n\nAt another town hall, a voter who identified herself as a retired military officer and Republican, pressed Hageman on allegations of fraud in the government in a tense exchange.\n\n“You are a lawyer, where is this fraud?” the voter asked Hageman, according to CSPAN video of the town hall. The voter added: “What company, what organization, what personnel are we going after?”\n\nHageman pointed to spending by the US Agency for International Development – which the Trump administration and DOGE are attempting to dismantle – as the fraud. “This is what it is. This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud, spending is the fraud,” Hageman asserted, to the dissatisfaction of the constituent and other attendees, who repeatedly interrupted her as she attempted to cite numbers.\n\nA federal worker and Republican in Wyoming, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, said GOP rhetoric about federal employees has been a let-down — including Musk’s “fork in the road” email offering months of severance pay, which the worker described as “a little off-putting.”\n\n“I don’t think we’re all parasites” the federal worker told CNN. “I try not to take it too personally. I know what I do. I know how committed I am.”\n\nGoing into the week, Democrats took most Republicans retreating from public view as an invitation to meet with their constituents and drive a forceful argument about how Republicans’ government funding plan would slash spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBut the anger that greeted Democrats at their own town halls left them returning to Washington next week without appearing to have gained great political momentum during their time at home – instead offering a vivid window into the party’s struggles during the first two months of Trump’s presidency.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low of just 29%, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found — an outcome fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that the party should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.\n\nBranding it a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has aimed to galvanize those looking for some form of political action with rallies across the country. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow progressive, joined the swing through competitive Western states Thursday – but, underscoring the party’s divide, that answer to Democratic voters’ demands for action drew public criticism from some corners of the party.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada, said Trump has “handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling this country for parts to the richest people on the planet for a kickback.” But she also had sharp words for her own party.\n\n“We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”\n\n‘What is the plan?’\n\nAt the town hall meetings, attendees who voted for Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said they felt let down by the party’s failure to show it’s up to the task of matching their furor and responding with force.\n\nIn Scottsdale, Arizona, when Kelly and Gallego argued at a joint event Monday that there was a path to convince Republicans to preserve Medicaid, Jacie Czerwinski had heard enough.\n\n“When are they going to take the gloves off and actually do something,” she said under her breath. “They’re preaching to the choir.”\n\nCzerwinski, a Democrat who owns a rock-climbing gym in the area, had called Kelly’s office multiple times since the start of the Trump administration. And when Kelly told the audience to leave voicemails to senators as a way to make their voices heard, she shouted: “Yours is full!”\n\nThe swing state’s two Democratic senators ducked an attendee’s shouted question about whether they support removing Schumer from his leadership post after his public support for the spending measure last week. “We’re focusing on this right now,” Gallego said, noting the town hall was billed as one focused on what Democrats characterize as a Republican push to cut Medicaid spending.\n\nQuianna Brown, who said her 10-year-old daughter’s Medicaid coverage is at risk now that she is no longer in the foster system, pushed back on the senators who described cuts to Medicaid as yet to be determined.\n\n“What do we do? We feel incredibly powerless trying to plan for our family. We can’t wait until it’s done. We need to know how to prepare what may come down the hatch. We are trying to shield ourselves before we’re wounded, and we don’t know how,” Brown said.\n\nKelly described Brown’s story as “incredibly powerful” and asked for her name in order to share it with Republicans in Washington. Gallego said Democrats “would all love to be able to snap our fingers right now and have that solution, but it’s not going to happen that way.”\n\n“We have to fight them down. We have to grind them to the point where they give up on this fight. Because if you give an inch, they will take it all,” he said.\n\nAfter the event, Brown told CNN she appreciated the senators hearing her out but wasn’t satisfied. “I wanted more. I think as a parent at any time when you feel that you can’t protect your kid, you want a game plan. Like what is the plan?” she said.\n\nThe senators, she told CNN following the event, were being “too business as usual.”\n\nJefri Knazan, who had taught in Canada but returned to the United States for family reasons and is currently on Medicaid, was so frustrated by how the senators answered Brown that she changed her question to push them to “be straight with us” on how to take the fight “to the next level.”\n\nMultiple attendees took their blunt assessments even further in conversations with CNN, saying the party lacks a clear leader and an effective message.\n\n“I don’t think showing up with hand fans at a speech does much,” said retired Navy veteran Tom Dyson, referring to signs Democratic lawmakers held up during Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. “I think you have to take action. I think you have to speak out.”\n\nFor retiree Donald Bandy, frustration with the Democratic Party is an “understatement.”\n\n“We don’t seem to be organized. We don’t have a coalition. We don’t have any power. Republicans control everything and everyone’s afraid of Trump. It’s what he says goes,” Bandy said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11 - Source: CNN 'You are not fighting!': Voters demand answers at Democratic lawmaker town hall 01:11\n\n‘We need you to be less polite’\n\nAt a town hall for Ivey, the second-term Democratic congressman, held in Forestville, Maryland, attendees lambasted the role Democrats, particularly Schumer, played in helping congressional Republicans approve the continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown.\n\n“The message that was sent by Democrats in Congress with the CR catastrophe was clear,” a man who identified himself as John told Ivey. “It’s not that you are in the minority, it’s that you aren’t even working together on a shared strategy. And that is failure.”\n\nIvey listened as the man continued, raising his voice.\n\n“We are not interested in hearing that you are in the minority – we know that!” John yelled into the mic. “We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority. We want you to show fight and you are not fighting!”\n\nAnother constituent, Donya Williams, complained Ivey didn’t know the people in his district well enough — because he admitted earlier that he didn’t know who popular podcaster Joe Rogan was until the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n“You don’t know anything about a podcast, and as a Democratic (lawmaker) who’s representing all of these people, you don’t know how to reach them,” Williams said. “So therefore, you don’t know us.”\n\nIvey countered that he and other members of Congress are trying to do more to connect with younger voters on social media. “The key is to make sure that we turn to each other and not on each other in doing the outreach,” he said.\n\nIvey kept his composure throughout the evening, drawing a compliment from one woman. But then she, too, turned critical: “We need you to be less polite.”\n\n‘Be the opposition party’\n\nIn the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove, attendees at Casten’s town hall Wednesday night were largely complimentary of the congressman’s opposition to Trump. But, they told CNN before the town hall got underway, they were furious with Sen. Dick Durbin’s vote to advance the spending measure last week.\n\n“Dick Durbin needs to be primaried in two years,” said Ben Holinga, a 43-year-old salesman and Democratic voter from nearby Willowbrook.\n\n“I’m very upset with how Democrats in the Senate handled the continuing resolution,” he said. “They should try actually fighting for once. They should try to actually be the opposition party.”\n\nRick Lunt, a 68-year-old retiree and Democratic voter from Palos Hills, said he is happy with Casten and “wanted to be here to show him support.” But he said he’d like to see Democrats take more measures to show their opposition to Trump, even if they are purely symbolic.\n\nDemocrats could, he said, “propose a resolution of impeachment or something” to remove Trump from office – acknowledging that “sometimes just a symbolic effort, movement on that part, is enough to inspire the rest of us.”\n\nCasten’s town hall was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters — with one protester who declined to share his name with CNN climbing on stage and refusing to leave.\n\nChants of “Casten” and “leave, leave, leave” rang through the room as some sought to drown out the protests, but after more than 45 minutes of interruptions, local police asked the congressman to end his event.\n\n“The consequence of what you’re doing is that the good people in this room are going to decide not to come to town halls anymore,” Casten told protesters, “because it’s not productive.”\n\nCNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Danny Freeman contributed to this report.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nElon Musk seems to be everywhere these days, just not in the place he’s most needed: at the helm of his flailing electric vehicle company.\n\nTesla is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 so far this year. Sales are falling around the globe. The US resale market is crumbling. Tesla’s militaristic Cybertruck is under a recall order because of an exterior panel that can fall off the vehicle while driving. The company was abruptly booted from this week’s Vancouver International Auto Show over unspecified safety concerns. And according to an analysis by the Financial Times, there’s about $1.4 billion that just sort of disappeared from the company’s balance sheet.\n\nThat’s to say nothing of the company’s brand identity. Tesla was once a badge of pride for upwardly mobile, environmentally conscious lefties. More recently, it has become a talisman of an increasingly authoritarian right wing.\n\nInvestors — even Tesla’s staunchest supporters — are rapidly losing patience.\n\nOn Thursday, Wall Street’s No. 1 Tesla bull pleaded with Musk and Tesla’s board to “stop being silent” and fix their mess.\n\n“Let’s call it like is: Tesla is going through a crisis and there is one person who can fix it … Musk,” wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a note to clients. “Tesla is Musk, and Musk is Tesla. They are synonymous and cannot be separated.”\n\nBut where is the boss?\n\n“Musk is spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla’s CEO),” Ives said.\n\nAnother major investor, Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday that “there isn’t more that Elon could do to turn off customers” and that it’s time for the board to find a new CEO.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nLate Thursday night, Musk addressed employees in an all-hands meeting broadcast on X, acknowledging the “bit of stormy weather” hitting Tesla’s shares. He also repeated his claim that Tesla is on track to make its vehicles fully autonomous and encouraged employees to hold on to their stock.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how unusual it is for a Tesla cheerleader like Ives to so pointedly criticize Musk.\n\nOver the years, investors have tolerated all kinds of behavior in Musk — his racist tweets, his spreading of Covid-19 misinformation, publicly inviting business partners to go f*** themselves, to name just a few — that they would find unacceptable for other CEOs. His antics were priced in because Tesla was so undeniably ahead of its competition.\n\nAnd though he was prone to childish outbursts, investors knew Musk would lock in if Tesla were in trouble. When the company fell behind on Model 3 production in 2018, Musk told the press he was sleeping on the factory floor and working through the night to make sure Tesla met its target.\n\nTo be sure, Tesla is still the most popular EV maker in America. But it is rapidly losing market share in the US and abroad — partly because of rising competition and partly because Tesla itself hasn’t done enough to innovate.\n\nThose core business concerns are the primary reasons investors have slashed their Tesla holdings, causing the stock to lose half its value since December.\n\nMusk’s mad-oligarch turn is hardly helping. Until recently, Wall Street might have shrugged at the public’s performative boycotts, occasional vandalism or one-off protests outside a Tesla showroom. But, as Ives notes, social movements against Musk are creating real hazards that threaten to drag the stock deeper into the gutter.\n\nAlso not helping: The people publicly pumping Tesla up are some of the most powerful voices on the planet — and even they can’t pull the stock out of its spiral, which is closing in on nine straight weeks of declines.\n\nIn a Fox News appearance Wednesday night, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick straight-up told viewers to “buy Tesla” — the kind of explicit endorsement that appeared to run afoul of government ethics rules that bar officials from using their office to endorse specific companies or products.\n\nLutnick’s pitch didn’t seem to help much; Tesla shares fell 1.7% in premarket trading Thursday. A late afternoon rally pushed shares up 0.17% for the day.\n\nA week earlier, President Donald Trump himself — historically not a fan of EVs — peddled Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House, giving the company’s shares a sharp but short-lived bump.\n\nBottom line: Musk, whose vast fortune is directly linked to his 13% stake in Tesla, sauntered into Washington two months ago with a vision of running the government like a business. In doing so, he appears to be neglecting the actual business that made him a household name and the world’s richest person.",

        "title": "4 things to know about Trump’s effort to dismantle the Department of Education",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump kicked off the process of dismantling the Department of Education by signing an executive order on Thursday.\n\nThe move aims to fulfill a longstanding campaign promise and shift more power over education to the states. While the president cannot completely shut down the agency without approval from Congress, the department announced earlier this month that nearly half its staff would leave through layoffs and voluntary buyouts.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to the agency’s programs and functions, and legal challenges to Trump’s executive order are likely.\n\nFederal funding for students with disabilities, who fall under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, along with Title I funding for low-income schools and federal student loan payments, will not be changed by the order, a senior administration official said. However, the order bans programs or activities receiving agency funds from advancing diversity, equity and inclusion or gender ideology.\n\nSupporters of the order have said that education oversight should be returned to the states and parents, while opponents argue that that the move will harm children and their ability to learn.\n\nHere’s what to know about the Trump administration’s effort to dismantle the Department of Education:\n\nLow-income, rural and disabled students could be impacted\n\nThe Department of Education provides tens of billions of dollars in funding to support millions of students in low-income and rural areas and those with disabilities – and advocates are concerned about what the agency’s shuttering could mean for them.\n\nThe agency funnels more than $18 billion in supplemental funding annually to local school districts to provide extra academic support to schools with high rates of poverty. Title I grants serve about 26 million low-income students.\n\nThe dismantling of the department, along with the loss of many of its staffers, raises concerns about ensuring that states and districts will use the federal funds in the best ways to lead to positive outcomes for students, said Weade James, senior director for K-12 education policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. For instance, she questioned whether states will track students’ progress.\n\nAlso, rural and smaller school districts rely on the Department of Education for technical assistance and for the implementation of the Title I grants and other programs, she noted.\n\n“It’s very important that we continue to question how these cuts are going to impact students because indeed they are,” James said. “There’s going to be a loss of expertise and a loss of data collection, oversight and accountability.”\n\nThe Department of Education also sets the parameters around accommodations for disabled students, ensuring that they have the right to a free and appropriate public education. The agency helps fund schools for the deaf and blind in the US and oversees the Rehabilitation Services Administration, which provides services that aim to help Americans with disabilities live more independently and land jobs. The department provides more than $15 billion annually to help serve 7.4 million students through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA.\n\nWhat happens to these functions remains to be seen, but Project 2025, a sweeping plan to overhaul the federal government written by several people in Trump’s orbit, called for the functions to be shifted to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is not as knowledgeable about the programs, said Mia Ives-Rublee, senior director for the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress. That could make it much more difficult for students with disabilities to get the services they need, she said.\n\n“What we do know is we’re going to see a radical change in the way we provide or don’t provide services to disabled students,” she said.\n\nQuestions remain around management of federal student loans\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Education has struggled to find a viable alternative agency to manage its massive student debt portfolio, according to two sources involved in the discussions. The loan portfolio totals a staggering $1.8 trillion in debt, with an estimated 40% of loans past due, the sources said, up from what CNN has previously reported based on publicly available information.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced ahead of the executive order’s signing on Thursday that certain “critical functions” like student loans and administering grants to at-risk students would remain with the Department of Education, but Trump later said those functions would be redistributed to other agencies.\n\nThe discrepancy could set up a challenge for Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who is required by law to carry out some of the department’s congressionally mandated functions, including administering loans and providing grants for schools in high-poverty areas.\n\nThe president had previously suggested that the portfolio – which is larger than all but three US banks – would be transferred to the Treasury Department or Small Business Administration, though those plans have not taken shape.\n\n“Treasury doesn’t want it,” according to one of the sources involved in the discussions, who also told CNN no conversations about moving it to the Small Business Administration had advanced.\n\nLocal school curriculum won’t be directly impacted by Trump’s order\n\nThe Department of Education does not have control over the curriculum in schools.\n\nIn creating the Department of Education, Congress said:\n\n“No provision of a program administered by the Secretary or by any other officer of the Department shall be construed to authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, over any accrediting agency or association, or over the selection or content of library resources, textbooks, or other instructional materials by any educational institution or school system, except to the extent authorized by law.”\n\nResponsibility for curriculum falls on states and localities, so the executive order would not affect students’ curriculum directly.\n\nThe Department of Education has announced cuts of nearly 50% to its workforce\n\nThrough a combination of layoffs and voluntary “buyouts,” the Department of Education has announced plans to nearly halve its workforce since Trump took office.\n\nOne of the offices hit hardest by the job cuts, the Office for Civil Rights, works to protect students by holding schools and colleges that receive federal funds accountable for combating antisemitism, islamophobia, racism and discrimination against students with disabilities.\n\nThe Trump administration is shuttering seven of the office’s 12 regional offices and laying off nearly half of its staff\n\nWhat happens to the office is still uncertain. But employees within the office have told CNN they are extremely concerned about their ability to process the claims effectively with half of the staff.\n\n“This will completely halt the vast majority of cases that we can take in, evaluate and investigate,” said one employee at OCR, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution.\n\nCNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story.",

Then she jumped on the back of Benin local Honoré Orogbo's motorbike and the trip changed her life in more ways than she ever could have imagined.\n\nDownload Transcript Episode Transcript\n\nFrancesca Street 00:00:02 Imagine you're on a solo trip. You're in a country you've never been to before, and you've just jumped on the back of a stranger's motorbike.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:00:15 So you said, if you want, I can bring you there. It's about ten minutes away. So, I'll take a chance. Hop on the back of his motorcycle.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:00:29 That's Rachel Décoste, a Canadian traveler in her 40s who just arrived in West Africa's Republic of Benin. And you heard it right, she just jumped on the back of a stranger's motorbike. Let's rewind and explain a bit how we got here. Rachel arrived in Benin back in 2018 and she was on a family history odyssey. Rachel had always known that she was a descendant of enslaved Africans, But until a DNA test earlier that year, she didn't know where her forebears had lived.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:01:07 So the DNA test for a descendant of enslaved Africans has very deep significance for us. Even though it's not a precise science, when you get the map of where your ancestors came from, it's an emotional journey.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:01:27 Suddenly, she had a list of countries where she had roots.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:01:31 Senegal, Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo, Ghana.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:01:37 So, Rachel decided to pack her bags for an epic adventure.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:01:44 I just kind of, like, flew by the seat of my pants for six months. Senegal was great. All of them were great.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:01:50 Rachel arrived in Benin towards the end of her half year remote working trip. She expected this could be the most significant of all the stops on her tour.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:02:00 My ancestors are from there, making my maiden voyage to the motherland. It was important for me to include that in my journey.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:02:11 Benin is also home to Ouidah, once one of the most active slave trading ports in Africa.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:02:18 I'm sure that one of my ancestors passed by there just because of my DNA test. There's not that many other choices.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:02:24 For this reason, visiting Ouidah was top of Rachel's priorities while in Benin. So shortly after she arrived, Rachel stepped out of her accommodation and glanced around, looking for someone to ask for directions.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:02:40 Many of these African homes have huge, tall gates. I opened up the gate. The first guy I see outside, I say bonjour, ça va? Which is how you start a conversation with a stranger in West Africa in French, which just means hello, how are you?\n\nFrancesca Street 00:03:01 This motorbike riding stranger was Honoré Orogbo, a single father and business owner who just happened to be passing by that morning.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:03:11 So he said, if you want, I can bring you there. It's about ten minutes away.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:03:15 Rachel had no intention of driving during her trip and public transportation wasn't reliable.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:03:21 So I figure 9:00 in the morning, I'll take a chance. Hop on the back of his motorcycle. Had I left five minutes later, it would have been a missed connection. Like, you cannot plan this.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:03:41 'I'm Francesca Street, CNN travel journalist, and this is Chance Encounters, a podcast about the incredible connections we make while traveling. This week, we're fall in love while traveling through West Africa's Republic of Benin. It's 2018, and Canadian traveler Rachel Décoste just landed here. Before she arrived in Benin, Rachel anticipated an important journey of self-discovery. But she could never have predicted the extent to which this trip would change her life. Rachel is French-Canadian and Honoré first language is also French, and that's still the language they communicate in today.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:04:34 (French)\n\nRachel Décoste 00:04:39 So Honoré believed that this was destiny because he was not planning on being at that spot where we met that morning.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:04:49 And when I listen to her voice that sounds like she is foreign. She's not local. And then I said, okay, I'm gonna just help you because you don't know anywhere in our country.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:05:05 So Honoré ended up taking Rachel all the way to Ouidah.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:05:11 And we get to Ouidah one hour and a quarter later. And I'm like, okay, good to go. Thanks, sir.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:05:19 Before they went their separate ways, Rachel asked Honoré if he wanted to get brunch. She wanted a bite to eat before she started her tour, and extending the invite to Honoré felt like the polite choice. He'd gone out of his way to help her after all. When the two sat down to eat, Rachel was acutely aware that she was a woman traveling alone.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:05:43 In Canada, I'm a dark skinned Black woman, but in Africa, I'm Mariah Carey. Okay, so I don't blend. They could tell from my skin tone and I'm not even talking about the way I dress.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:05:56 Honoré had been nothing but polite and respectful, but he was still a stranger. So when he quizzed Rachel about herself, she was pretty economical with the truth.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:06:08 Where are you from? Haiti. I'm going to tell him I'm from Canada. What do you do for a living? I'm a secretary. I'm actually an engineer. But I'm not going to tell him that. Are you married? Oh, yeah. My husband's waiting for me at the hotel, right? Like, I'm married. I'm not worth any money. I'm not worth kidnaping. Like, I'm not available. Don't pick me if you have any ill intentions type of thing.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:06:33 A relationship started on lies isn't usually a great start, but at that stage, Rachel wasn't expecting to see Honoré again. Still, while she didn't share the true details of her life, Rachel did explain how she was hoping to travel around Benin over the coming days, and after a bit of back and forth, Honoré, agreed to be Rachel's driver, with Rachel paying him to take her around the country for the rest of the week. Honoré took Rachel to Benin's most important sights. Touring Benin was a powerful experience for Rachel.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:07:12 Did you kind of start opening up a bit more. Or were you still kind of keeping some barriers because you still didn't know him and everything else?\n\nRachel Décoste 00:07:20 'We both were very open and very candid because we were strangers, and we'll never see each other again. He was candid about his family. For example, he was a single dad of a, then he was four-year- old son. But I remember him saying at one point when I'm riding on the back of his motorcycle, he says, you know, you'll have to forgive my old motorcycle because I'd rather put my child in English school. He paid a lot of money for that, he says I'd rather have my kid have those opportunities than drive a fancy motorcycle. And I thought, wow, I saw myself in those values. And my whole family actually in those values where we may not come from money, but there's always money for education because it's that important. And they sacrifice themselves for their children.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:08:19 They were having this conversation while on their way to a huge market where Rachel was going to pick out some fabric for dresses.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:08:30 The market in Cotonou, for fabric, it's the size of like five football fields. Fabrics stores and one after the other. And there's just a million different options and I can't pick.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:08:44 Rachel was overwhelmed by the choice, so much so that she asked Honoré to pick his favorites. He opted for two pieces of colorful, bright Ankara fabric. The third option was a white gray lace style called lessi. Rachel loved it.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:09:05 And I thought the dress I will make with this could be appropriate for a baptism or some kind of special occasion.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:09:17 Dress for a special occasion in hand, Rachel left the market. She was starting to grow closer to Honoré, but he still thought she was married. When we come back, Rachel tells Honoré the truth.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:09:36 Welcome back to Chance Encounters. I'm Francesca Street. Before the break, chemistry was starting to bubble and things were starting to change between Rachel and Honoré. They definitely weren't strangers anymore. And in one of the many conversations driving to Benin landmarks, Honoré had mentioned to Rachel that when he and his friends wanted a night out that travel to Lomé, the capital of the neighboring country of Togo. Rachel thought this kind of sounded like fun.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:10:16 'I can't guarantee that I'll come back here. This is a once-in-a lifetime trip. So I said, if you're willing, I could get two hotel rooms and we could go to Togo together and we could go to one of those bars that you think is so great. And we did go to Togo. We're dancing, it's just pure joy. It was absolutely like, wow. And it was in Togo that I was like, after I think five days that we were together. Then I was like, hmm, we get along great. He laughs at my jokes, I had a bit of a meltdown, which I'm not proud of, where he didn't freak out. He took it all in stride and we just clicked. I would never do this in real life. Well, that's not true. I guess I did it in real life, but this is not in my character to be forward. But I reached out and kissed him first, and I told him that I really wasn't married. And he was very happy to hear that. And he was just. In total shock. His legs almost fell under him. I sent an email to one of my girlfriends in Ottawa. I met this guy. I've known him for four days. We get along so great. I've met some of his family. I met his kid. We get along great. I don't know how to say in English, le courant passe. We have a connection.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:11:55 Oh, like the chemistry, maybe?\n\nRachel Décoste 00:11:56 Yeah, we had chemistry.\n\n00:11:57 Yeah.\n\n00:11:59 I think this should be my husband. But am I crazy? Like, I've known this guy for a week. Is that stupid? Tell me if I'm crazy. And she says, and I quote, I still have the email. It says, Rachel, you're not a stupid person. You have good judgment. You are a good judge of character. If he's the one, grab him. And that's when I was like, you know what? I'm going to tell him the truth that I'm not married.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:12:34 For the remainder of Rachel's time in Benin, she and Honoré, they spent as much time together as they could.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:12:41 Well, I guess we, he kind of moved in with me for the rest of our time in Benin.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:12:50 And then on the evening of Rachel's return to Canada. Honoré and Rachel sat together side by side on a beach.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:13:01 We just discussed, like, you know. Is this it? Do you want to continue? He's like, yes. You know, I have to go back to the Americas. How would you feel about joining me? And he he had to think about it.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:13:21 It was a big decision. Rachel and Honoré had only known each other for a couple of weeks. For Honoré, emigrating had never been a goal. He knew it would be a big change for his son. But Honoré says he decided to follow his instincts.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:13:39 (French)\n\nRachel Décoste 00:13:44 Sometimes, you have to follow your heart.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:13:45 Voila, c'est ça\n\nRachel Décoste 00:13:47 That's it.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:13:50 Two weeks after we met, we got engaged.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:13:54 (French)\n\nRachel Décoste 00:13:57 When we got engaged, it felt like a movie.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:14:00 (French)\n\nRachel Décoste 00:14:03 I'm the kind of person that takes a long time to analyze people. So when she suggested that we get married, I surprised myself when I said yes almost immediately.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:14:16 From that, things moved quickly.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:14:19 Got married six months later in Benin.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:14:25 And remember that dress made from that white lace fabric that Honoré and Rachel picked out during that first week together in Benin?\n\nRachel Décoste 00:14:33 So that dress ended up being my wedding dress.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:14:38 Wow.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:14:40 You can't make this up. He picked my wedding dress the day after we met. So he joined me in Canada.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:14:50 For Honoré, the Canadian winter was a bit of a shock, but he was so happy to be with Rachel. His son quickly settled into the new routine, too. They became a family in Canada.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:15:05 Everybody's reaction was shock. Because I'm perpetually single and happy being single. So first it's shock. And mostly they're just so happy. And yes, the the serendipity of the meeting and the whole journey, I've been told too many times, this sounds like a movie.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:15:27 Today, seven years after Rachel spontaneously jumped on Honoré's motorcycle, the couple live happily with their son in Canada. They own a business together, creating garments with African inspired prints. Honoré is studying while Rachel is working as a diversity and inclusion expert, as well as writing a memoir about her travels and, of course, her incredible love story.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:15:59 I wonder if there's a particular emotion or message, you would want a listener to this podcast to take away into their own life and maybe learn from you guys in some way.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:16:12 My message is that you're never too old to travel solo. Travel is okay as a woman, and there's no expiry date on the possibility of finding the love of your life.\n\nHonoré Orogbo 00:16:31 Sometimes you have to make a decision based on your intuition, not what other people said.\n\nRachel Décoste 00:16:40 I already told Honoré that he's my good luck charm. I'm the luckiest girl in the world. I should have bought a lottery ticket that day.\n\nFrancesca Street 00:16:53 Thank you to Rachel Décoste and Honoré Orogbo for sharing their Chance Encounter.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nKelly Clarkson got vulnerable while marking a milestone for her popular daytime talk show.\n\nSeveral guest hosts had filled in for Clarkson in recent weeks as she was absent for unknown reasons. The singer on Thursday welcomed her audience 1000th episode of “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” which first premiered September 9, 2019 on NBC.\n\nShe called the five-and-half-year journey “crazy.”\n\n“We have met some hugely talented people, tons of big stars and inspiring everyday heroes,” she said. “We created a community and supported each other through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of ups and downs personally as well.”\n\n“We have laughed together, we have cried together with beautiful stories, sang together with some people, danced together, celebrated and competed together,” she said. “I’ve lost, alone, a lot.”\n\nClarkson did not specify what she was referring to, but she paused briefly to assure the audience, “It’s okay.”\n\nKelly Clarkson Celebrates 1000th Episode!\n\nShe’s had some major life changes in recent years. Clarkson moved the show from Los Angeles to New York in Season 5, following her divorce from her former husband of almost seven years, Brandon Blackstock. The couple share two children, River Rose and Remington Alexander.\n\nShe has publicly reflected on the difficulty of their split.\n\n“I mean, it’s no secret my life has been a little bit of a dumpster,” Clarkson said during a “Today” appearance in 2020. “Personally, it’s been a little hard the last couple of months.”\n\nShe’s embraced her cross-country move and how it helped her find more time for walking and managing her health.\n\nDuring the taping of her 1000th episode, Clarkson had even more to say about how the show, and she, have evolved.\n\n“I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built and the community we created,” Clarkson said. “We’ve started with the intention of making connections and bringing people together and it feels like we’ve been doing just that.”",

Daniel Heuer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Friday morning told a federal judge that the Trump administration is holding Cabinet-level discussions on whether to invoke the state secrets privilege in response to demands it release more information on last weekend’s deportation flights.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg chastised the Justice Department yesterday, saying it did not obey his order that it turn over information he’s seeking about deportations the Trump administration carried out last weekend, saying it “evaded its obligations.”\n\nBoasberg had ordered the administration to turn over the information by noon ET Thursday or invoke the “state-secrets privilege” in its bid to avoiding provide the information. But in a brief order Thursday afternoon, the judge said the department had instead submitted a sealed filing “shortly after” the deadline.\n\nThe DOJ filing, Boasberg wrote, included a sworn statement from an official with the ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations who “repeated the same general information about the flights” and went on to say that Cabinet secretaries are “’are currently actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets privilege over the other facts requested by the Court’s order.’”\n\n“This is woefully insufficient,” Boasberg wrote. “The Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege; indeed, his declaration on that point, not surprisingly, is based solely on his unsubstantiated ‘understand[ing].’”\n\nHappening today: Boasberg is holding a hearing this afternoon on the Trump administration’s attempt to lift his order barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.",

        "content": "Many prominent mainstream news organizations are facing an \"inmates-running-the-asylum situation\" after liberal employees have failed to get on the same page with business-minded bosses, according to media critics.\n\nThe ownership of the Washington Post, as well as the Los Angeles Times, irked staffers when ending the decades-long practice of endorsing presidential candidates last year and continued to bother liberal employees with recent changes to their opinion sections. MSNBC’s biggest stars have gone on-air to condemn network management and other newsroom overlords have been publicly rebuked by their staff. While many media leaders continue to turn a blind eye to the liberal groupthink that has infiltrated newsrooms, others have pushed back on disgruntled employees.\n\n\"At long last, some executives at establishment journalism outlets have figured out that their staffers are not necessarily interested in being surrogates for the news-consuming public they are presumably supposed to serve. Instead, most newsrooms are filled with activist journalists living in a groupthink world where they have hired new reporters and editors who are supposed to think just like them,\" DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall told Fox News Digital.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW BLASTS MSNBC FOR AXING JOY REID, CALLS OUT NETWORK'S TREATMENT OF STAFFERS IN STUNNING REBUKE\n\nThe latest example came when Martin Varsavsky, a Jewish tech mogul who sits on Politico parent company Axel Springer’s supervisory board, accused the outlet of \"one sided Hamas support.\"\n\nPolitico published an Associated Press report headlined, \"Israel hits Gaza with new airstrikes that kill at least 200,\" that did not go over well with Varsavsky.\n\n\"I am on the board of Axel Springer that owns Político. I consider this article one sided Hamas support. It fails to mention that the airstrikes were aimed at eliminating top Hamas military and that Israel was successful at doing so. It also quotes casualty figures given by Hamas that are not believed to be accurate,\" Varsavsky wrote on X.\n\nIn a since-deleted follow-up that was reported by Jewish Insider, Varsavsky reportedly wrote \"most journalists are woke and to the left of the general public\" and \"management does not dare to fire them.\"\n\nMcCall believes a lack of intellectual diversity has led to declines in news consumption and the bottom line.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, news consumers have drifted to confirmation news sources, podcasters, and so on, or simply become news bystanders who don't pay attention to the news,\" McCall said.\n\n\"Owners of media outlets need to maintain their courage to reinvent the news industry, restore credibility, and build newsrooms that are committed to fairness and serving audiences, and not the staffers,\" McCall added. \"That might mean some housecleaning of the more activist staffers and replacing them with reporters who understand the higher mission of journalism.\"\n\nIn another recent act of defiance, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow recently used her primetime perch to scold her bosses over Joy Reid’s program \"The ReidOut\" being canceled by the liberal network last month.\n\n\"It is absolutely an inmates-running-the-asylum situation, and this is why nearly every media organization is failing. Woke work culture, with woke management and a woke human resources department, pushing woke messaging is a recipe for disaster for any business - especially one that's failing, like most liberal publications and networks,\" Heritage Foundation media fellow Tim Young told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Most major media organizations – particularly newspapers and leftist cable news channels – have seemingly sunk themselves by focusing on everything but profit over the past decade – and it's partially due to their focus on placating the woke, entitled mob they have inside their organizations.\"\n\nYoung said that management at these outlets should have started making better decisions years ago, and it might be too late at this point.\n\n\"For many of these organizations, they're beyond simply needing to shift a few staff members and a bit of strategy to improve - they need to literally start over from scratch,\" he said.\n\nThe trend of rank-and-file journalists not seeing eye-to-eye with management has been a major theme in recent years.\n\nLos Angeles Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong sparked complaints from staffers when he wanted to add conservative voices to the paper’s opinion section, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos saw opinion editor David Shipley step down when he announced the Post opinion page would be completely revamped, focusing on \"writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.\"\n\nLast year, Soon-Shiong and Bezos sparked internal backlash when they nixed planned endorsements of Vice President Kamala Harris from their respective papers.\n\nLIBERAL PUNDITS DUB WASHINGTON POST'S LATEST OPINION SHAKE-UP A 'TERRIBLE TRAGEDY,' SLAM JEFF BEZOS\n\nNBC News and MSNBC were overwhelmed in controversy fueled by their own staffers earlier in 2024 after the company hired former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a contributor. A variety of high-profile anchors and pundits publicly disavowed McDaniel's hiring, citing her alleged actions in trying to block the certification of Michigan's election results in 2020.\n\nHosts like Maddow, Nicolle Wallace and Jen Psaki spoke out against the move, and staffers got their way when NBC News announced McDaniel was being let go only four days after her hiring was announced.\n\nIn October, left-wing staffers at CBS News lashed out at their colleague, \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil, over a tough but civil interview exchange with progressive author Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nDokoupil, who is Jewish and has children living in Israel, angered liberal colleagues by suggesting that Coates’ book \"The Message,\" which is harshly critical of Israel and has been rebuked by the Jewish state's defenders, would \"not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.\"\n\nCBS leadership insisted the interview did not meet \"editorial standards,\" but Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone defended Dokoupil after he was reprimanded internally.\n\n\"I think Tony did a great job with that interview. I think he handled himself and showed the world and modeled what civil discourse is. He showed that there was accountability, that there is a system of checks and balances, and frankly, I was very proud of the work that he did,\" Redstone said during a panel in New York, according to the Washington Post.\n\nMSNBC STARS SHOOT INSIDE THE TENT, ATTACK NBC FOR HIRING EX-RNC CHAIR RONNA MCDANIEL: ‘INEXPLICABLE’\n\nIn 2023, CNN staffers, including anchor Christiane Amanpour, publicly scolded their boss, then-CNN CEO Chris Licht, for giving a primetime town hall event to President Donald Trump when he was running for office again. Many CNN staffers didn’t feel Trump deserved a platform on the network, and Licht was never able to regain the faith of his workforce before getting fired that summer.\n\nCNN STAFFERS CONTINUE UNDERMINING BOSS BY TOUTING CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR'S BLISTERING TAKEDOWN OF TRUMP TOWN HALL\n\nNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck said Americans have shown their displeasure with the far-left worldview at the ballot box but \"these liberal partisans\" still think they’re in charge.\n\n\"The inmates still believe they have some divine mandate to control what their audiences are force-fed and supposed to believe. It's also likely there's still at least a few who are deathly terrified of their far-left base,\" Houck told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"For all the talk in the liberal media that Republicans are scared of their right flanks, liberal journalists and their editorial bosses certainly feel at least warm to mildly hot when a BlueSky mob or other keyboard warrior groundswell in the comments section comes to the forefront,\" Houck continued. \"It's maddening and no way any serious person runs a company, especially outside the political realm.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital’s Joseph A.

That must be our total focus. There is a time and place for politics, but it is not now.\"\n\nThe effort to remove Karen Bass from office kicked off after intense criticism of her response to the fires that destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Pacific Palisades, including from Caruso, a Democrat.\n\nKRISTIN CROWLEY APPEALS LOS ANGELES MAYOR'S DECISION TO TERMINATE HER AS LAFD CHIEF\n\nBass was in Ghana when the fires began despite a prior weather warning, for which she has since expressed remorse. But she has stopped short of stepping down. She also recently sacked the city's fire chief, Kristin Crowley, who failed to get her job back after appealing.\n\nCaruso, a real estate mogul, ran against Bass in 2022 and lost, and it’s unclear if he plans to run against her again in 2026.\n\nHis decision not to support the recall caught the attention of former Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vice presidential pick Nicole Shanahan, a major supporter of the recall.\n\n\"Don’t people deserve accountability?!\" she said in reply to his post on X. \"I don’t see this as political division… I see this as LA being the most united I’ve ever seen it around the real cost of mismanagement. The recall team is [100%] bi-partisan.\"\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW CONFESSES LA FIRES CAUSED HER TO DRINK 'EVERY NIGHT'\n\n\"People want competency in their leadership,\" Caruso responded. \"But a recall election doesn’t happen overnight. It would run into June’s primary and cost the city millions we don't have. Let's be smart about how we move the city forward.\"\n\nThe disagreement led to a mix of opinions on the recall itself.\n\n\"’Cheaper to keep her' is that really your argument? Recalling her forthwith will likely be cheaper than keeping her in place (see: recent $200 billion fire that destroyed my family home). Shouldn’t this be up to the voters and not you anyway, Rick?\" Tranquility AI co-founder Dave Harvilicz posted.\n\n\"Disagree Rick. [Karen Bass] poses a clear and present danger to LA. She must go immediately,\" Biotech entrepreneur Houman David Hemmati posted. \"If you don’t want a recall, persuade her to resign. No other options. Sorry.\"\n\nLOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS RECALL EFFORT LAUNCHES\n\nHowever, some did agree with Caruso that a recall election would be an uphill battle.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The premise of [Caruso]’s decision not to back a recall (which is correct) is precisely BECAUSE it is the best interest of LA not to waste everyone’s time and energy on recall that is destined to fail and further demoralize voters at the worst possible time,\" Los Angeles County GOP Central Committee member Elizabeth Barcohana tweeted.\n\nTo trigger a recall election, a petition would need signatures from 15% of registered voters in the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\"This recall is nothing more than another extreme right-wing political stunt designed to divide Los Angeles when we need to move forward,\" Doug Herman, a strategist for Bass, told Fox News Digital in a statement when the campaign first launched.",

And I guess that's who I speak for.\"\n\nUngar-Sargon defines \"MAGA leftist\" as someone who identifies with \"the labor left\" in believing that the working class \"is the backbone of any society, and their ability to achieve a middle-class standard of living is the defining feature of whether we will have a stable democracy or not.\"\n\nMAHER ASKS ‘WHY DO WE WANT TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING’ AS TRUMP MAKES JOBS ARGUMENT IN TARIFF WAR\n\n\"To me, that's sort of what ‘left’ means, along with all the other stuff being anti-war, being pro-free speech, you know, this was all, like, left stuff, and now it's MAGA stuff,\" Ungar-Sargon said.\n\nThe independent journalist, who also wrote \"Bad News: How Woke Media Is Undermining Democracy,\" pushed back at the notion that she underwent a \"political evolution\" since she says her views haven't changed much. She did, however, concede that she was once a \"woke leftist\" with severe \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n\"In 2015, I hated him. In 2016, when he won, I stopped going to my favorite bar, Wheeler's, the local cop bar in Sheepshead Bay [in Brooklyn, New York], because everybody there had voted for him, and I felt that it was a personal betrayal,\" Ungar-Sargon admitted, laughing at herself. \"Like I was one of those lefties. I really had the derangement bad, ok? I'm embarrassed to say. Of course, now I'm back at Wheeler's more often than I should be, probably.\"\n\nWhat triggered her tectonic shift away from TDS didn't exactly involve Trump himself (though her pro-Trump Orthodox rabbi certainly helped). It was a 2018 Yale University study that showed White liberals were more likely to dumb down their language when speaking to people of color compared to White conservatives.\n\n\"I remember when I read that I was so shook because I instantly recognized that it was true,\" Ungar-Sargon recalled. \"And it was an indictment of not just my milieu, but my entire worldview, which I immediately could recognize was built on the same thing that makes White liberals behave in such a racist way, which was this idea that Blacks and Hispanics are beneath us and need our help. Like, it's disgusting. But the entire progressive movement is really based on that idea.\"\n\n\"So I remember looking at that study and feeling like I'm about to lose all my friends because this is true, and it's undeniable, and it's an indictment of everything I think,\" she continued. \"And so I remember I put it in a desk drawer in my office. I closed the door and I said, 'I'm not ready to deal with the fallout here. I'm not ready to acknowledge this. I'll be back in three months.' And three months later, I came back, and I was like, 'Okay, what does this mean, Batya? Like, what does it mean you're wrong about?'\n\n\"And that sort of slowly started to change my perception of President Trump because this was such orthodoxy. Everything I thought was like, you know, the fundamentals of what I believed were so clearly wrong. And again, you have this feeling of like, 'Well, if I'm wrong about this, what else might I be wrong about?'\"\n\nJAMES CARVILLE OFFERS LOVER ADVICE TO YOUNG PROGRESSIVES FOLLOWING ‘LOVE IS BLIND’ POLITICAL BLOW-UP\n\nShe described the 2020 election as being a \"toss up\" with her vote ultimately being for Joe Biden.\n\nWhat the country underwent during the COVID pandemic, between how everyone was \"lied to\" about the virus and the harm lockdowns and vaccine mandates had on the working class, all done by the elites, was a deterrent for her to continue supporting the Democratic Party that she says has rejected her. Meanwhile, Trump was reshaping the Republican Party.\n\nAnd in doing so, she said, he built a coalition that included pro-life, pro-traditional marriage conservatives and pro-choice, pro-gay marriage leftists like herself.\n\n\"That is his genius, right? He looked at the party. He looked at the Reagan party, which was socially conservative, free trade and foreign interventions and foreign wars. And he had the confidence to say, 'That is not where the American people are at. They're not socially conservative, they're socially moderate. They support gay marriage, and they want there to be exceptions for abortion,'\" Ungar-Sargon said.\n\n\"Can you imagine the confidence to not only take on the Democrats, but to destroy and rebuild the GOP? People say [it's rebuilt] in his image, but it's not in his image. It's in the image of the American working class. On every issue. You look at the polling and President Trump is where 65 to 90% of Americans are at. And he just had the confidence to say, like, 'This is where the electorate is at. I love the American people, and I'm going to represent them.' And that is exactly what he did,\" she added.\n\nUngar-Sargon learned this first-hand while interviewing working-class Americans for her book \"Second Class,\" with many of them praising Trump's policies from his first term in office.\n\n\"People would make a very persuasive case to me about how his protectionist economic policies, specifically around trade and the border, had put money in their pockets and helped them become people who could aspire to the American dream once again after they had thought that that was really off the table for them,\" the author said. \"And I started to see the president as somebody who was a polarizing character only for the elites. But when you got out of the elites, he was actually a very unifying person who had a very unifying agenda when it came to kind of normies.\"\n\n\"And I really came to respect what he had done in terms of seeing through the interests of the elites that had been pushed for 50 years by both parties and saying, 'Actually, I'm going to take on the elites on both sides on behalf of the forgotten men and women of this great country,'\" she continued. \"And I think that I just could no longer deny that that was the real story, despite what all of us were told all the time about President Trump.\"\n\nThroughout her political journey, Ungar-Sargon felt welcomed by the MAGA movement, saying people would reach out and tell her, \"I don't agree with you about everything, but you are so welcome in this movement.\"\n\n\"And it's the exact opposite of the left. The left- if you agree with them on 99.9% of the issues, and you have a 0.1% disagreement on some issue, like, 'Yeah, maybe we shouldn't defund the police, how about reforming the police?' You are dead to them. You are out. They will do anything to destroy your life,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\nBILL MAHER RIPS LEFT'S ‘EXCLUSIONARY ATTITUDE’ AS ‘HAMILTON’ CANCELS SHOWS AT TRUMP-BACKED KENNEDY CENTER\n\n\"And there's clearly an appetite within MAGA not just to be part of a multi-racial coalition, which I think a lot of people in the movement are very proud of, and not just to have people from all walks of life and all religions represented, but even to have people from all ideological walks of life. It is a very welcoming movement for people who come at the abortion question, let's say, from a slightly different point of view. I mean, President Trump and JD Vance come at the abortion question from different points of view, and there's no reason that the GOP shouldn't be a big tent around this kind of beautiful diversity.\"\n\nIn the 2024 election, for the very first time, she voted for Trump, a decision she expressed zero regret for on \"Real Time.\"\n\n\"I mean, you must have a feeling in your gut- look me in the eye and tell me you don't- that this is really going badly, and I shouldn't have thrown my lot in with this team,\" Maher said to Ungar-Sargon, to which she replied, \"Oh, no, I feel the opposite.\"\n\nShe gave Maher credit for inviting her back on his show in what she called a \"genuine attempt\" at understanding why she and others continue to support Trump. She suspected the ideological disconnect may come down to pure economics.\n\n\"The argument that I made in both of my books was that for the leftist progressive elites, a lot of this is economic. And I'm not saying this about Bill [Maher] specifically, but I think as a class, their economic interests are very much at odds with those of the people that Trump represents,\" Ungar-Sargon said. \"They've made trillions of dollars collectively out of the open border, and they've been able to dress up the economic benefits of their progressivism as virtue while actually it's wage theft of their working-class neighbors, right? Because they can hire illegals instead of having to hire working-class people, which puts money back in their pockets. A lot of money.\"\n\nThe columnist went on to say that instead of strengthening the lower and middle classes, the liberal elite would rather \"raise the bar on what counts as poor and pay people off not to work.\"\n\n\"It's kind of like a plane, you know, and the knowledge industry, leftist elites, the over-credentialed, you know, multi-credentialed top 10% who now control 60% of the GDP, they're in first class,\" Ungar-Sargon said. \"And what they're basically saying to the American people is 'We're happy to pay your ticket, and you can fly on this plane for free as long as you stay in coach,' you know. 'Don't you dare use our bathrooms. And there's no upgrades. And you don't get to say where the plane is going. But as long as you're happy to sit in economy, you can sit there for free, and we'll pay your ticket.' That's really, like, the best metaphor for the Democratic Party right now.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn contrast, she said Trump understands his supporters don't want a free ride and want an economy that delivers a \"modest version of the American dream.\"",

        "content": "As many Democratic-run major cities across America double down on resisting the Trump administration’s illegal immigration crackdown, law enforcement agencies in Texas’ two largest cities are now alerting ICE of encounters with illegal immigrants.\n\nThis comes after ICE filed administrative warrants in the National Crime Information Center to arrest and deport some 700,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle first reported that police officers in Texas’ largest city will call federal immigration authorities whenever they encounter an illegal immigrant with a federal administrative warrant against them.\n\nIn line with this policy, Houston Police Department officers are directed to communicate with ICE once an illegal immigrant with an administrative warrant is detected. Officers are then directed to discuss options for transferring the illegal immigrant to ICE custody, which could include holding them on the scene until ICE arrives.\n\nBLUE SANCTUARY STATE OPERATING AS 'CONTROL' CENTER FOR VICIOUS MIGRANT GANG: ACTING DEA CHIEF\n\nAccording to the Chronicle, this policy is already being implemented. The outlet reported that Jose Armando Lainez Argueta, a 40-year-old Salvadoran national illegally present in the country, was arrested by ICE after his name came up in the system during a routine traffic stop by Houston police.\n\nMeanwhile, local outlet News 4 San Antonio reported that the police in San Antonio, the second-largest city in Texas and seventh largest in the U.S., will also be following a similar policy, alerting local ICE officials of encounters with illegal immigrants who come up in the National Crime Information Center system as having federal administrative warrants against them.\n\nThe outlet obtained an email sent to San Antonio Police Department officers in which officers were told to \"contact the ICE Law Enforcement Service Center … and request an ICE officer come to the scene to arrest the individual.\"\n\nThe email said the types of illegals who may come up in the system include previously deported felons, aliens who have been previously ordered deported or removed, and individuals with civil immigration detainer orders against them.\n\n'OPERATION TAKE BACK AMERICA' RESULTS IN OVER 80 ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTS\n\nThe San Antonio Police Department did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nHowever, the department’s sister agency, the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office, told Fox News Digital that while it does not directly alert ICE of illegal immigrant encounters, it does have a policy of coordinating with ICE and regularly has immigration officials visit county jails to conduct interviews.\n\nBexar Deputy Sheriff Johnny Garcia told Fox News Digital that ICE officials enter county jails to conduct interviews as often as \"every three hours.\"\n\nThe sheriff’s office also gives ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officials 48-hour notice of when an illegal immigrant with an immigration detainer is set to be released from jail.\n\n‘BRING IT ON’: SHERIFF PUSHES BACK AFTER BLUE-STATE LEADERS SUE TO STOP IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT\n\n\"They're visiting the jail just to make contact with any new persons that may be arrested. So there's no obstruction in that regard,\" he explained. \"They come in just like any other officer of law enforcement official who has access and authority to enter the jail for official purposes. They, too, have that ability to come into the jail and conduct their business as needed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\nGarcia told Fox News Digital that their policy of cooperating with ICE is simply in line with all state and federal laws.\n\n\"We do what is required of us by the law,\" he said.\n\n‘CLOSING TIME’: WHITE HOUSE, BORDER PATROL TROLL WITH DEPORTATION MEME VIDEO\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Fox News Digital that though the agency \"does not comment on the agency’s internal methods for operational security reasons,\" he said the use of administrative arrest warrants is a \"vital tool to protect public safety and reduce the amount of taxpayer resources needed to fund law enforcement at all levels of government.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"ICE is leveraging all available law enforcement resources to aggressively pursue these aliens to restore law and order in our communities and integrity to our nation’s immigration laws,\" he said. \"By taking advantage of all lawful means to carry out our critical mission, it not only bolsters public safety, national security and border security, it also lessens the threat that our officers face each day when they bravely go out into the community to apprehend these violent criminal aliens.\"",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "Two high school graduates who say they can't read or write are suing their respective public school systems, arguing they were not given the free public education to which they are entitled.\n\nCornell Law School Professor William A. Jacobson, director of the Securities Law Clinic, told Fox News Digital the lawsuits signify a \"much deeper problem\" with the American public school system.\n\n\"I think these cases reflect a deeper problem in education. For each of these cases, there are probably tens of thousands of students who never got a proper education — they get pushed along the system,\" Jacobson said. \"Unfortunately … we've created incentives, particularly for public school systems, to just push students along and not to hold them accountable.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has railed against the Department of Education for \"failing American students,\" a White House fact sheet published Thursday reads. The administration has suggested plans to eliminate the Department altogether, directing education authority to individual states.\n\nTRUMP STILL NEEDS CONGRESS' HELP WITH PLAN TO ABOLISH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT\n\n\"Since 1979, the U.S. Department of Education has spent over $3 trillion with virtually nothing to show for it,\" the fact sheet reads. \"Despite per-pupil spending having increased by more than 245% over that period, there has been virtually no measurable improvement in student achievement: Math and reading scores for 13-year-olds are at the lowest level in decades . … Seven-in-ten fourth and eighth graders are not proficient in reading, while 40% of fourth grade students don’t even meet basic reading levels.\"\n\nTennessee lawsuit\n\nAn appellate court judge recently sided with Tennessee student William A., ruling that the student was denied the free public education to which he is entitled under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n\nEDUCATION LEADERS SAY TRUMP DISMANTLING KEY GOVERNMENT AGENCY ‘SAVED EDUCATION'\n\n\"William graduated from high school without being able to read or even to spell his own name,\" Circuit Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote in his judgment. \"That was because, per the terms of his IEPs, he relied on a host of accommodations that masked his inability to read.\"\n\nTo write a paper, William would speak the topic into a speech-to-text software and paste the words into an AI app like Chat-GPT, which would then \"generate a paper on that topic,\" Kethledge explained. William would then paste that text back into his own document and \"run that paper through another software program like Grammarly, so that it reflected an appropriate writing style.\"\n\nEDUCATION DEPT LAUNCHES WIDESPREAD CIVIL RIGHTS PROBE: A LOOK AT WHAT THE AGENCY AS TRUMP EYES SHUTDOWN\n\nWilliam, who has severe dyslexia, went through 12 years of public education with an independent education plan (IEP), never learned to read or write, and still graduated with a 3.4 GPA, according to court documents.\n\n\"This kid can't read.\" — Teacher in William A. lawsuit\n\nWhen William was in 9th grade in 2020, a special education teacher asked a school psychologist to \"[p]lease take a look at William [A]. I am very concerned.\"\n\nThe teacher stated: \"this kid can’t read,\" according to the suit.\n\nThe Clarksville-Montgomery County School System (CMCSS) in Tennessee, \"knowing he cannot read, passed him right along, creating an artificial GPA of 3.41 by the end of eleventh grade putting William on a path to regular education diploma, even though he lacked basic reading skills,\" the original complaint reads.\n\nCMCSS told Fox News Digital it does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nUS ‘REPORT CARD’ SHOWS STUDENTS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IN READING, BARELY BUDGED IN MATH: ‘THE NEWS IS NOT GOOD’\n\n\"By March 2023, William could not consistently spell his own first and last name while signing his IEP. And in June 2023, William’s own writing sample illustrated he was unable to write more than 31 words in three minutes. He misspelled half the words, all of which were Kindergarten level sight words he had memorized,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nConnecticut lawsuit\n\nIn a similar lawsuit out of Connecticut, a high school graduate named Aleysha Ortiz argues similarly that she went through years of public education in Hartford County with a learning disability and IEP without ever being taught how to read or write.\n\nOrtiz not only graduated with honors, but she was also admitted into the University of Connecticut, according to the complaint.\n\nOrtiz argues in her complaint that while her reading and writing skills were not properly addressed, she presented \"younger than her age socially and emotionally\" and was subjected to bullying.\n\nLike William, Ortiz began using \"assistive technology to help her read and write, and advocated for herself tirelessly in school,\" the complaint states.\n\n\"She told them that she was concerned that she was not prepared for college…\" — Aleysha Ortiz lawsuit\n\n\"In May 2024, the Plaintiff reported to her case manager and PPT that she had been accepted and planned to attend the University of Connecticut after graduation,\" the complaint states. \"She told them that she was concerned that she was not prepared for college and would not be able to obtain the accommodations she would need in college to be successful due to the Board’s refusal to permit proper testing.\"\n\nOrtiz was concerned that her elementary-level reading and writing skills would \"impact her ability to be successful in college,\" but \"[t]t wasn’t until approximately one month before graduation that the [Hartford Board of Education] agreed to conduct additional testing that the Plaintiff had been asking for.\"\n\nCHILDREN SCORING WORSE IN MATH AND READING COMPARED TO BEFORE LOCKDOWNS, DATA SHOWS: ‘MULTIYEAR RECOVERY’\n\nAttorneys for the Hartford Board of Education did not respond to Fox News Digital.\n\nThe \"deeper problem\"\n\nJacobson told Fox News Digital that \"in fairness\" to teachers and school districts, they are \"caught between various forces pushing against each other.\"\n\n\"On the one hand, there's oftentimes money tied to performance. And if you fail students, if you don't advance them, that could affect the funding that the school district gets,\" he explained. \"There are individual students who have parents who … want them not to fail. And so there's a lot of pressure there.\"\n\nNATIONWIDE TEACHER SHORTAGES LEAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RELYING ON ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS\n\nAn increasing number of public school students have IEPs, meaning more students have individualized learning programs that teachers, who are already overwhelmed by national employee shortages, must accommodate by law.\n\n\"This is a real problem, and it's a failure at its core of our educational system.\" — Prof. William Jacobson, Cornell Law\n\n\"Obviously, it varies district to district,\" Jacobson said. \"Some have perfectly good intentions. Some have maybe not good intentions and just want to go along to get along.\"\n\nPARENTS, ACTIVISTS HOPE STUDENTS CAN OVERCOME COVID DISRUPTIONS: ‘THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO ARE BEHIND’\n\nThe Cornell Law professor added that while he does not see AI going anywhere in the future of education, \"we've got to be very firm that AI does not end up actually dumbing down the students rather than informing the students, because you can become very dependent on it, and that's another problem, but it's one we can't ignore.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jacobson said, parents should be more focused on helping their children to read and write.\n\n\"I think parents would be better focused on helping their students and their children learn, rather than worrying about the next lawsuit,\" he said. \"I realize that might be a little unrealistic, because we are in a culture of trying to cash in on lawsuits, but I think our energy should be focused on fixing the system and getting students properly treated, as opposed to: how are we going to sue the school district?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJustin Gilbert, the attorney representing William A., told Fox News Digital that \"[w]ith up to 20% of the students in the United States having dyslexia, William’s case reinforces the need for dyslexia-trained teachers.\"\n\n\"Most of us take reading for granted, but once we move outside the ‘reading window’ of the elementary school years, learning to read becomes much harder,\" Gilbert said. \"That’s particularly true for students with dyslexia. William’s case is a reminder, though a tragic one, of the need for greater awareness of dyslexia in the public schools.\"",

The program specified that schools that complied with the changes would receive a reimbursement of 6 additional cents for each lunch served.\n\n\"It became a partisan issue. People were telling me that I'm trying to be the ‘nanny state,’ and I'm trying to control what our kids are eating and telling them what's good for them and what's not good for them,\" Obama told Kelce.\n\nWhile acknowledging the pushback, Obama said that she thinks the program made a difference.\n\n\"Eventually, we got a lot done. You know, we were able to improve the nutrition standards, the labels so that they were more readable, so that people's parents could really understand the breakdown of fat and sugar, and it was clear we got the school nutrition standards improved in our schools for the first time in like 50 years.

I planted a garden to try to get people more focused on making vegetables a little more fun and interesting for kids.

Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\"\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philly Anti-Capitalist vandalized a university police vehicle, broke windows of local businesses, smashed an ATM and graffitied anti-police and anarchist messaging near the college campus, prompting police to advise students to remain indoors.\n\nThe violent riot was one of many such events that occurred nationwide in 2020 in the wake of the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"An initial UPenn alert about the unrest was sent to the Penn community at 9:37 p.m. on Aug. 25,\" The Daily Pennsylvanian reported at the time. \"The Division of Public Safety updated its website with a more detailed explanation of the events at approximately 10:00 p.m. that night, before an all-clear update was issued at 10:21 p.m.\"\n\nNow, as vandals firebomb Tesla dealerships across the nation, Philly Anti-Capitalist is helping to foment further violence.\n\nSUSPECTED TESLA ARSONISTS HIT WITH FEDERAL CHARGES IN ACTS OF ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’: AG\n\nThe group's site recommends against using Molotov cocktails, as several radicals across the country have, in favor of more effective devices. It also directs combatants on how much explosive material to use and where to place that material on vehicles in order to cause the most damage.\n\nPhilly Anti-Capitalist also provides tips on using those devices without getting hurt and quickly enough to escape undetected, and directs would-be arsonists to another site for further details on protecting their anonymity.\n\nSAN JOSE MAN ARRESTED AFTER VIRAL VIDEO SHOWS SUSPECT KEYING TESLA IN COSTCO PARKING LOT\n\n\"Stay anonymous, get home safe, and go torch the ever loving s--- out of every part of this miserable society,\" the post concluded.\n\n\"Seeing the wave of tesla arsons has made us incredibly happy,\" the group said on its site.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the FBI, ATF and Pennsylvania State Police, all of whom would not comment.\n\nFox News Digital also reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department, the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office and Philly Anti-Capitalist.\n\nOn Thursday, Bondi announced federal charges against three people for allegedly firebombing Tesla dealerships and charging stations around the country.\n\nTESLA GROUP LEADER WARNS VIOLENT PROTESTS AGAINST CAR OWNERS ARE JUST THE ‘STARTING POINT’\n\nPAM BONDI: WHY IS A JUDGE ‘TRYING TO PROTECT TERRORISTS?’\n\nAdam Matthew Lansky, 41, on Jan. 20, threw approximately eight Molotov cocktails at a Tesla dealership located in Salem, Oregon, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nLucy Grace Nelson, also known as Justin Thomas Nelson, 42, was arrested in Loveland, Colorado on Jan. 29 after attempting to light Teslas on fire with Molotov cocktails, prosecutors said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDaniel Clarke-Pounder, 24, allegedly wrote profane messages against President Donald Trump and advocated for Ukraine around Tesla charging stations in Charleston, South Carolina before lighting three of the charging stations on fire with Molotov cocktails on March 7.\n\nFox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.",

        "content": "New court filings in the Idaho student murders case could severely handicap suspect Bryan Kohberger's defense, according to legal experts – he allegedly purchased a Ka-Bar knife on Amazon months before the murders and then shopped for a replacement days after they took place.\n\nBryan Kohberger, a 30-year-old former criminology Ph.D. student, is accused of using a large, bladed weapon to kill four University of Idaho undergrads – Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20 and Ethan Chapin, 20.\n\nAccording to Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt, all four victims died with multiple stab wounds. At least two of them were so intoxicated at the time of the attack that they were unable to resist at all, prosecutors wrote in court filings.\n\nUnder Mogen's body, police found a Ka-Bar knife sheath, stamped with a United States Marine Corps logo and allegedly containing Kohberger's DNA on the snap.\n\nPROSECUTORS CLAP BACK AT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S ‘BUSHY EYEBROWS’ DENIAL BY SHARING ALLEGED SELFIE FROM DAY OF MURDERS\n\nProsecutors revealed in court filings this week that he allegedly bought a Ka-Bar, a sheath and a sharpener on Amazon in March 2022, months before the murders. Then, in the weeks after the murders, his Amazon app \"click activity\" allegedly shows he was browsing for a replacement.\n\nExperts say the shopping list will be difficult for the defense to explain away, especially based on the timing and the specific details about what Kohberger was allegedly looking at.\n\nThat is a catastrophic fact for his defense. — Edwina Elcox, Boise defense lawyer\n\n\"There's always kind of this lore around that using a knife in a murder is particularly personal,\" said Edwina Elcox, a Boise defense attorney who has been following the case. \"And then the time frame of the search that links him, if this is correct, to this murder weapon shows a significant level, or at least I'm sure the prosecution would argue, shows a significant level of premeditation.\"\n\nShe said that the slate of newly revealed evidence against Kohberger indicates prosecutors may have a stronger case than previously known.\n\nRead the filing:\n\nIDAHO COURT RELEASES SURVIVING ROOMMATES' TEXT MESSAGES FROM NIGHT OF STUDENT MURDERS\n\nKohberger's defense team has asked the court to keep his Amazon records out of the trial.\n\n\"The information that is publicly available is that …the murder weapon, other than the sheath, has never been recovered,\" Elcox told Fox News Digital. \"And then he is searching for this very, very specific item. This is beyond a catastrophic fact to the defense…I do not know how you explain that away.\"\n\nFor Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and cold case investigator, the Amazon business records are yet another tool in the digital era that he believes will increasingly help law enforcement solve crimes going forward.\n\n\"Electronic evidence is gonna bring this case to a head for sure – it's amazing,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I said cellphone records, internet records and video surveillance are things that are gonna solve most cases going forward, but having this type of information is extremely damaging.\"\n\nProsecutors made the revelation in response to Kohberger's defense team trying to have evidence of his Amazon activity kept out of the trial, arguing in part that the retail giant's algorithm \"shapes user behavior\" by serving up items it predicts shoppers want.\n\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\n\n\"Applying the test for relevancy, first, Kohberger’s click activity which shows a purchase of a Ka-Bar knife and sheath before the homicides, makes it more probable (than it would be without the evidence) that the Ka-Bar sheath found at the crime scene was Bryan Kohberger’s,\" Latah County Deputy Prosecutor Ashley Jennings wrote in a court filing made public Wednesday evening.\n\n\"Second, Kohberger’s click activity after the homicides makes it more probable (than it would be without the evidence) that Kohberger had a reason to search for a Ka-Bar knife and sheath after the homicides.\"\n\nGET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB\n\nJudge Steven Hippler this week denied Kohberger's request to have an expert testify about the Amazon data at a hearing next month. He has not yet ruled on the motion to exclude the evidence.\n\nFBI'S KOHBERGER DNA TACTICS DIDN'T VIOLATE LAW, BUT THEY RAISE ANOTHER PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERN\n\n\"This is the smoking gun evidence in the case,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who has been following the case.\n\nWATCH: Former prosecutor breaks down Bryan Kohberger’s Amazon history\n\nThe DNA connects Kohberger to the crime scene, and his Amazon history undermines a defense theory that it could have been planted, he said.\n\n\"This was a big mistake by Kohberger, who was otherwise very careful about covering his tracks,\" he added.\n\nSIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\nKohberger was pursuing a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University, just 10 miles down the road from the University of Idaho crime scene .\n\n\"I think he fancies himself…as remarkably intelligent, but as somebody who has studied this field, you know that law enforcement and their searches cast a wide, wide net,\" Elcox told Fox News Digital. \"Having this in a searchable history format is…OK, you just have to wonder, I don't think you're maybe as smart as you thought you were.\"\n\nProsecutors have also alleged they traced his car, a white Hyundai Elantra, to and from the crime scene, that an eyewitness saw a masked man inside the home just after the murders, and that phone records also corroborate their alleged timeline of events. But Kohberger was not identified as a suspect until more than a month after the slaying with the help of investigative genetic genealogy.\n\nWhile legal experts say the Amazon history is damming evidence, it also raises new questions for people who study the criminal mind, a topic Kohberger himself had studied at the graduate level. Was a suspect looking to replace a missing sheath, after leaving one behind at the crime scene, or a budding serial killer taking steps toward another kill?\n\n\"I don’t think this killing was a one off – I think…whoever did this, they were likely to kill again,\" Dr. Kris Mohandie, a criminal psychologist, told Fox News Digital. \"If it was him, why would he kill like that unless he enjoyed it? Further, he was interested in serial killers.\"\n\nAnd although whoever committed the crime is believed to have taken steps to conceal their tracks, he added killers always make a mistake that catches up to them.\n\n\"I’ll guarantee you that scene didn’t have one fingerprint of his on it, nor did it have anyone else’s,\" said John Kelly, a criminal profiler who has been following the case. \"Because whoever did it wiped it down so well.\"\n\nBRYAN KOHBERGER DOESN'T WANT AMAZON SHOPPING LIST REVEALED AT TRIAL\n\nWhile search warrants show police recovered knives after Kohberger's arrest, none have been publicly identified as a potential murder weapon.\n\nKohberger's trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 11 in Boise.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe could face the death penalty if convicted.

Boston was born facing down bullies,\" she added.\n\nShe noted that while she was in D.C., she kept an eye on what was happening back in Boston, where she was pleased to see locals protesting with signs reading, \"We stand with immigrants,\" \"You belong here,\" \"Somos una ciudad de inmigrantes\" [We are a city of immigrants], and \"Boston doesn’t back down.\"\n\nMAJOR BLUE CITY MAYOR SILENT AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT USES SHELTER FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY\n\nShe extolled Boston's virtues as a city, describing it as a \"family\" that sticks together and defends its own, including illegal immigrants.\n\n\"We are a city where the Irish coffee is strong, and our opinions are stronger,\" she said. \"We may not always agree or see eye-to-eye, but at the end of the day, we are a family.

Newman sent out a letter to the system’s leaders informing them that diversity statements are no longer required for new applicants.\n\nNewman wrote that while some programs and departments have required them, the university has never had a policy of diversity statements and believes it could harm applicant evaluation.\n\nNEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY\n\n\"The requirement to submit a diversity statement may lead applicants to focus on an aspect of their candidacy that is outside their expertise or prior experience,\" the letter obtained by Fox News Digital read.\n\nShe added that employees and applicants can still reference accomplishments related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) on their own, but requiring stand-alone diversity statements is no longer permitted.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, UC Board of Regents Chair Janet Reilly said that the university will still continue to honor its commitment to \"embrace and celebrate Californians from a variety of life experiences, backgrounds, and points of view.\"\n\nUC follows the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and University of Michigan in eliminating diversity statements as elite colleges start scaling back on DEI initiatives.\n\nThe news came one month after a letter from the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights was sent out to departments of education across all 50 states warning them to remove diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies or risk legal consequences, including a loss of federal funding.\n\nThe Trump administration already pulled $400 million in grants to Columbia University earlier this month, citing the school’s failure to address rising antisemitism on campus.\n\nELITE UNIVERSITY ELIMINATES DEI HIRING REQUIREMENT: 'THEY DON'T WORK'\n\nThough the school was unclear whether these were factors in the decision to remove diversity statements, UC President Michael Drake also announced a system-wide hiring freeze and several cost-saving measures ahead of a significant state budget cut and any potential federal challenges in the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "content": "Puerto Rico, which for years was seen as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants, is now facing increased attention under the Trump administration, and an immigration expert tells Fox News Digital the U.S. island territory has long been a favored jurisdiction for evading immigration restrictions.\n\nMore than 200 people have been arrested since deportation operations in Puerto Rico ramped up on Jan. 26, 149 of which have been citizens of the Dominican Republic, according to U.S. Customs and Immigration data provided to the Associated Press. Local migrants are \"panicking,\" Jose Rodriguez, the president of the Dominican Committee of Human Rights, told the AP. \"They're afraid to go out; they're afraid to take their children to school.\"\n\nIllegal migrants have lived in Puerto Rico \"for decades,\" according to the report, which added that many had been staying in the U.S. territory \"without fear of arrest\" while many have been allowed to open bank accounts, obtain driver's licenses and even open their own businesses.\n\nBut Heritage Foundation Border Security and Immigration Center director Lora Ries tells Fox that's long been a problem with island territories like Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nTRUMP POLICY ON BORDER JUMPERS EMPOWERS USE OF 'MAXIMUM CONSEQUENCES,' BORDER AGENT TELLS FOX\n\n\"These localities allow them to open bank accounts, give driver's licenses, allow them to open businesses, it's just facilitating and prolonging this illegal immigration,\" Ries said. \"And then, of course, the immigrants, the aliens, if they are put into removal proceedings by ICE, then they use that as a shield, a defense, saying, 'You can't deport me because I've been here so many years, and I have a business here, and I have these financial ties.'\"\n\nThe recent raids have \"shattered the perception\" that the island territory is a sanctuary for illegal immigrants, causing many to live in fear about their own fate.\n\nRies said that despite the perception of safety, illegal migrants in any U.S. territory face the same potential consequences as those on the mainland United States.\n\n\"They always skip over personal responsibility. They knew they broke the law. They knew they were continuing to break the law. They knew that they could be arrested and removed and detained for breaking the law … don't try to shift responsibility to the U.S. government and then play victim,\" Ries said.\n\nRies noted that U.S. territories, including those in the Pacific such as Guam, are often jumping-off points for illegal migrants, who first enter there and then find easier travel to the mainland United States. Meanwhile, others start a life that they try to later use as a \"shield\" from immigration authorities.\n\nINFLUX OF ILLEGAL CHINESE MIGRANTS THREATENS US TERRITORY; ISLAND MUST SHOW 'STRENGTH OF THE NATION'\n\nA U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the AP that the agency has focused its efforts in Puerto Rico on those with a criminal record or those who have received a final court ruling to leave the country.\n\nNevertheless, the AP report said there has been a surge in support for Puerto Rico's illegal immigrant population, noting that volunteers have been working to provide meals to families too afraid to leave their house, while government officials from multiple jurisdictions have moved to limit cooperation with federal authorities.\n\nRies argued the situation is no different from those that have played out in many areas of the U.S., where so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions have severely limited cooperation with federal authorities and prioritized illegal migrants over their native citizens.\n\nTRUMP PUTTING TROOPS ON BORDER WAS GAME CHANGER, SAN DIEGO SECTOR CHIEF SAYS: 'FORCE MULTIPLIER'\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" Ries said. \"It's local officials not cooperating with federal agents, or local officials dedicating very limited resources and time and attention to illegal aliens rather than their own constituents. They need to do a better job representing their citizens to giving their resources to citizens.\"\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.",

        "content": "A liberal Canadian member of Parliament claimed the Trump administration has committed an \"act of war\" over President Donald Trump repeatedly referring to Canada as the U.S.' \"51st state\" and for leveling tariffs on the nation.\n\n\"Well, I think Marco Rubio probably needs to be sent back to school because when you say that someone doesn’t have a right to have a country, that’s an act of war. When you rip up, arbitrarily, trade agreements and threaten and say you’re going to break a country, that’s an act of war. And Canadians have responded in kind,\" Canadian MP Charlie Angus, who is a member of the country's liberal New Democratic Party, said Monday during an interview with the MeidasTouch Network.\n\nAngus was reacting to a clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking with reporters during his recent trip to Canada for the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Rubio was repeatedly asked by the press to weigh in on Trump referring to Canada as the U.S.' \"51st state.\"\n\n\"The president has made his argument as to why he thinks Canada would be better off joining the United States… for economic purposes,\" Rubio said on March 14 when asked about Trump's \"51st state\" comments, explaining the issue was not addressed during the G7 meeting. \"There’s a disagreement between the president’s position and the position of the Canadian government. I don’t think that’s a mystery coming in, and it wasn’t a topic of conversation, because that’s not what this summit was about.\"\n\nRubio further explained that the origin of the \"51st state\" rhetoric was born during a meeting between Trump and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump began using the \"51st state\" title for Canada in November 2024, following his election win.\n\nCANADA 'RAGE ROOM' LETS VISITORS SMASH TRUMP, VANCE, MUSK PORTRAITS TO RELEASE TARIFF ANGST\n\nTrump was meeting with Trudeau, \"and Trudeau basically says that if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canada, Canada couldn’t survive as a nation-state, at which point the president said, ‘Well, then you should become a state.’ And that’s where this began,\" Rubio recounted of the Trump–Trudeau meeting. \"He made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like. He’s made that argument repeatedly, and I think it stands for itself.\"\n\nTrudeau announced his resignation as the country's prime minister in January after nine years in the position. Mark Carney was sworn-in as the nation's next prime minister on March 14 after he was elected the new leader of Canada's Liberal Party earlier in the month.\n\nDuring his interview, Angus said that Canada's boycott of U.S. products over tariffs leveled on the nation would be \"punishing\" to the U.S.\n\nSTEVE MOORE: TARIFFS WILL BRING FREER AND FAIRER TRADE\n\n\"The boycott that Canada has launched against the United States is punishing. We were told in January a 10% drop in Canadian travel to the United States would cost 140,000 jobs,\" he continued.\n\nTrump leveled a 25% tariff on all imports of steel and aluminum from other nations on March 12, while Canada specifically is set to face a 25% tax on all imported goods beginning April 2. The tariffs have sparked boycotts of U.S. goods.\n\nNEW CANADIAN PM BLASTS TRUMP'S 51ST STATE IDEA: 'CRAZY'\n\nTrump joined Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, where he railed against how the U.S. has subsidized \"Canada by $200 billion a year.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Here’s my problem with Canada,\" Trump said on Fox News. \"Canada was meant to be the 51st state because we subsidize Canada by $200 billion a year. We don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we have a lot of lumber. … We don’t need their energy, we don’t need anything, we certainly don’t want their automobiles… millions of automobiles are sent in, I’d rather have them made in Michigan, I’d rather have them made in South Carolina.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Charles Creitz contributed to this report.",

        "content": "A group of self-described Satanists plans to stage a \"black mass\" inside the Kansas State Capitol, despite recent attempts by the governor and a group of bipartisan lawmakers to block it.\n\nThe Satanic Grotto, a registered nonprofit that describes itself as an \"independent and non-denominational Satanic church,\" intends to hold its demonstration at the state Capitol on March 28. According to founder Michael Stewart, the event initially drew little attention, until allegations surfaced that he stole consecrated bread from a local Catholic church for use in the \"black mass\" ceremony.\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, issued an order on March 12 barring The Satanic Grotto from entering the State House for its planned March 28 demonstration. That order was subsequently followed up by a modification of the State House's building and grounds policies, led by a group of bipartisan state legislators.\n\nFAITH LEADERS GATHER AROUND TRUMP TO PRAY IN OVAL OFFICE: ‘INCREDIBLE DAY’\n\n\"There are more constructive ways to protest and express disagreements without insulting or denigrating sacred religious symbols,\" Kelly said in an announcement about The Satanic Grotto's \"black mass\" event.\n\nIn Satanist traditions, a \"black mass\" ceremony sometimes involves the desecration of the consecrated Eucharist, as was recounted online by Monsignor Roger J. Landry, a priest of the Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, in 2014. Landry pointed out that, at the time, the New York Satanic Temple's website described the black mass as a \"perversion of the Catholic Mass\" and posited that a consecrated host gets \"corrupted by sexual fluids\" during the ritual.\n\nA lawsuit brought by the bishop of the Archdiocese of Kansas City, Joseph Naumann, alleged Stewart admitted on social media to stealing the consecrated Eucharist. The lawsuit also alleged members of The Satanic Grotto sent threatening letters to lawmakers.\n\n\"The First Amendment does not protect criminal conduct,\" Senate President Ty Masterson told the Kansas Reflector this week. \"Recent statements from an organization – which pledged to engage in such conduct – necessitated a thoughtful review of policies to ensure the safety of all those visiting our State Capitol.\"\n\nVANCE VOWS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL BE ‘BIGGEST DEFENDERS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES,’ CATHOLICS\n\nStewart, in an interview with Fox News Digital, did not deny the accusations that he was the owner of a social media account that admitted to taking the host. Stewart said that while he and his group may have sent rude letters to lawmakers in the past, none of them were threatening. An evidentiary hearing in the case took place Thursday, and it was ultimately dismissed after Stewart denied the allegations, he said.\n\nStewart promised to proceed with his demonstration at the Capitol on March 28, despite orders attempting to block it, even if it leads to his arrest. He expects to be joined by two or three other members of The Satanic Grotto but has urged unaffiliated supporters looking to confront public officials or law enforcement to stay back.\n\n\"It's come up a lot lately that we're going to storm the Capitol. And because [critics] see that one of our specific laws of the grotto speaks to violence, that we're a violent organization. Neither one of those things are true,\" Stewart said. \"We're going to the Capitol non-violently. This is not going to be January 6th. This is going to be a 1960s civil rights act. We're not going to be literally slinging fecal matter on the walls.\"\n\nDYLAN MULVANEY SAYS 'RELIGION AND FAITH USED AGAINST' RANS COMMUNITY, HOPES PEOPLE WILL FEEL ASHAMED\n\nStewart said that the idea of the \"black mass\" demonstration in Topeka stemmed from the group wanting \"to build a church that matches how Kansans define Satanism.\"\n\n\"Part of that is activism,\" Stewart said. \"We started following different groups and counterprotests, and inevitably they all ended up at the Capitol, one way or another.\"\n\nHowever, Stewart noted, the groups making use of their First Amendment rights by protesting at the Capitol were mostly all Christian groups \"holding pictures of mutilated babies inside of our Capitol, holding prayers, holding praise and worship sessions, very openly, very boldly, consistently.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I've rarely, if ever, seen anybody else do anything. And it just occurred to me, I was like, ‘Man, these guys are the only ones taking advantage of their rights.’\"\n\nKelly's office declined to comment on the situation when reached for comment, pointing Fox News Digital to a March 12 statement about the event.",

        "content": "The author of the bestselling memoir \"A Child Called ‘It:' One Child's Courage to Survive\" says allegations of child abuse against Connecticut stepmom Kimberly Sullivan are troubling.\n\n\"That is attempted murder,\" Dave Pelzer told Fox News Digital, adding details of the Sullivan case are \"beyond sadness.\"\n\nSullivan, 56, was arrested March 12 in Waterbury, Connecticut, after her 32-year-old stepson set a fire at their house Feb. 27 to escape what authorities said were abusive conditions. He weighed just 68 pounds.\n\nAs chronicled in his book, which has sold millions of copies and spent several years on The New York Times Best Sellers list, Pelzer was physically and emotionally abused by his mother from ages 4 to 12.\n\n‘MALNOURISHED MAN HELD CAPTIVE BY STEPMOM FOR DECADES SET FIRE TO HOME TO ESCAPE: ’I WANTED MY FREEDOM'\n\n\"I've worked a lot of cases — a lot of cases. This is severe. Extremely severe,\" Pelzer said. \"Because of the length of it and the fact, again, [the victim is] 5-foot-8 and 68 pounds. And I'm worried about his mental state.\"\n\nThe Waterbury Police Department located Sullivan's 32-year-old stepson at the home, where he admitted to setting the blaze.\n\nThe man, who has not been named, was found emaciated and told police he had been confined in the home since age 11. He said he had never received medical or dental care.\n\n\"I wanted my freedom,\" he told investigators.\n\nMAN DESCRIBES SHOCKING LIVING CONDITIONS HE ENDURED DURING 20-YEAR HOME CAPTIVITY: 'UNIMAGINABLE'\n\nAccording to an arrest warrant for Sullivan, the victim, identified as \"Male Victim 1,\" was held in a windowless 8-foot by 9-foot storage closet with no air conditioning or heat and without access to a bathroom for 20 years. He was kept inside the closet 22-24 hours per day.\n\nHe was allowed two sandwiches and two small water bottles each day, one of which he would use for bathing. He disposed of his waste using water bottles and newspaper.\n\nSullivan was arrested on charges of first-degree assault, second-degree kidnapping, first-degree unlawful restraint, cruelty to persons and first-degree reckless endangerment.\n\nShe was released on $300,000 bail.\n\nUTAH MOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE'S POWER, PUBLIC IMAGE ALLOWED CHILD ABUSE TO GO ‘UNCHECKED’: EXPERT\n\nDespite the fact the victim was sometimes allowed out of the house to let out the family dog and do chores, Pelzer said victims of extreme abuse do not run because they are conditioned by their parents into thinking that the abuse they face is normal.\n\n\"I've got to tell you, when I went to court, when I was being made a permanent ward of the court, I was with my beautiful social worker. God bless her,\" Pelzer said. \"And I saw my mom right across the hallway, and I forgot I had done this, but I guess I wrote a note to my mom saying, 'Dear mom, I'm so sorry about this.'\n\nPARIS HILTON URGES HOUSE TO PASS ‘STOP INSTITUTIONAL CHILD ABUSE ACT’ AFTER SENATE'S UNANIMOUS APPROVAL\n\n\"I remember one time I was going to run away,\" he said. \"I think I was 6, and I had it all planned out. I stole an apple pie and brought it into the basement. They were gone for an afternoon for family affair or whatever, and I was about to run away. I thought, 'Where am I going to go? Who's going to take me in?'\"\n\nWhile there have been reports the Connecticut Department of Children and Families visited the Sullivan home in response to reports from the victim's school, Pelzer explained that abusive parents often have a unique ability to manipulate authorities.\n\nRead Kimberly Sullivan's arrest warrant: Mobile users click here\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened for the victim and at the unspeakable conditions he endured. The now adult victim has shown incredible strength and resilience during this time of healing, and our hearts go out to him,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe department noted there are no records of visits to the Sullivan home on file because reports of neglect and abuse that are unsubstantiated are expunged from its system after five years.\n\nPelzer said he hopes a caring family member will support the victim, who will have limited state resources for recovery as an adult.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to two of the victim's sisters and Sullivan's attorney.",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "A former special envoy to Haiti blames what he views as former President Joe Biden's absentee approach to decision-making for the current woes afflicting the Caribbean nation.\n\nDaniel Foote served as special envoy to Haiti in 2021 but resigned in protest over what he said was the administration’s failed approach of supporting unpopular and unelected leaders.\n\n\"All of the governments that the U.S. has backed or anointed or imposed in the last 110 years have not represented the Haitian people,\" Foote said. He said the Biden administration backed the then-unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry solely for his unwavering loyalty despite lingering questions about how Henry rose to power.\n\n\n\nGANG VIOLENCE IN HAITI AT RECORD LEVELS AMID CRITICISMS US HAS NO 'CLEAR STRATEGY'\n\nFoote has been involved with Haiti since the devastating 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. He now believes the country has descended into near-total collapse.\n\n\"It's a thousand times worse now because we broke whatever weak social contract there was between the people and the government. And there has been no government since basically 2012. It's a failed state.\"\n\nA recent U.N. report revealed that more than 1 million people have been displaced due to gang violence in Haiti, nearly 10% of the population. Another report indicated that 85% of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, is under gang control.\n\nFoote said he never met Biden while serving as envoy, claiming that by then, Biden had \"deteriorated to the point that they didn’t want him to see a lot of people.\" Instead, he said, Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, and U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Michele Sison devised the plan to support Henry.\n\nFoote said he recalled a remark that Biden allegedly made as a senator in 1994: \"If Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests.\"\n\n\n\n\"That explains Joe Biden's approach to Haiti,\" Foote said.\n\nHAITIAN MAN CHARGED IN NC TRIPLE MURDER FLEW INTO US UNDER BIDEN MIGRANT FLIGHTS PROGRAM: ICE\n\nBiden’s spokesperson and Sison did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.\n\nNuland rejected Foote’s accusations, calling them \"completely false\" and referred Fox News Digital to former Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols.\n\n\"What I observed that there was intense coordination, and there was not one person or two people who would make a significant decision on the policy,\" Nichols said, noting that he got the job roughly a week before Foote resigned on Sept. 21 and so was not involved in earlier decisions. \"All issues were debated extensively internally at multiple levels, all the way up to the principals, that's the Cabinet secretary level.\"\n\nFoote said that in the past he felt no need for security while walking around Haiti because Americans were widely welcomed. Things are not the same anymore.\n\n\"Now the Haitians are looking at China, looking at Russia,\" he said. \"They're like, ‘Somebody help us. The Americans just keep screwing us over,’ yet they still want the Americans to help them.\"\n\nThe Biden administration committed around $600 million to fund an international security force, known as the multinational security support mission (MSS), composed of personnel from countries like Bangladesh, Kenya, Chad and Guyana. But Foote said he sees the MSS strategy as a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n\"They don't have the security backbone to take on the gangs,\" he said. \"They need help. And that help is not 5,000 random police officers from a mishmash of 10 different developing countries led by the Kenyans, who have never led a security mission in history.\"\n\nNichols defended the MSS, declaring their efforts \"incredibly heroic.\"\n\n\"Having seen them on the ground in Haiti, it's an extremely professional force, extremely courageous and one committed to the mission,\" he said.\n\nFoote recommends that President Donald Trump send 60 U.S. special forces personnel to train an elite anti-gang unit in Haiti and reestablish a signals intelligence program to monitor gang communication. Without such action, he said, the consequences would extend far beyond Haiti’s borders.\n\n\"It's just going to continue to create chaos right off the U.S. shores and create a massive surge in migration,\" he said. \"Because if you walk down the street in Port-au-Prince, you look around and think, 'I can understand why people leave. Humans can’t live in these conditions.'\"\n\nJack Brewer, who played in the NFL before founding a global foundation that has been in Haiti since the devastating 2010 earthquakes, echoed Foote’s assessment.\n\n\"People are being burned alive, police officers are getting their heads bashed into the pavement – bloody, torturous deaths,\" Brewer said. \"One of my doctors had five of his close friends and relatives murdered. This all just happened this week.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrewer said that any real change can come only from within Haiti.\n\n\"I'm talking about a culture that doesn't accept stealing and doesn't accept corruption,\" he said. \"Right now, culturally, it's acceptable to steal, and that has to change. Until you fix the moral fabric of a nation and reinstate law and order, it doesn't matter what America does.\"",

        "content": "Whether you're a Catholic abstaining from meat on Fridays during Lent or are a vegan or vegetarian hoping to boost your protein intake, you can still eat a wide variety of protein-rich foods.\n\nWherever you fall on the eating spectrum, nutrition experts agree it's a good idea to cut back on red and processed meats.\n\n\"The majority of nutrition research consistently shows that high intakes of red and processed meats are detrimental to cardiometabolic health, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" Stephanie Wells, a registered dietitian and owner of Thyme to Go Vegan Nutrition Services in Dallas, Texas, told Fox News Digital.\n\nEXTRA EGG WHITES CATAPULT CHEF'S PANCAKE BREAKFAST TO PROTEIN POWERHOUSE\n\nProcessed meat is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization, meaning it increases the risk for certain types of cancer.\n\n\"In light of these health risks, many people have been trying to eat less meat and are opting for more plant-based protein sources,\" Wells said.\n\nFox News Digital spoke with some dietitians who revealed the best non-meat protein sources to add to your diet.\n\n1. Tempeh\n\nWells of Dallas is a big fan of this product made from fermented soybeans with a whopping 34 grams of protein per cup.\n\nCHICKEN SALAD FROM NEW COOKBOOK HAS 'HIGH-PROTEIN FOCUS'\n\n\"It's an excellent source of iron, calcium and magnesium, all of which are made more bioavailable thanks to the fermentation process,\" she said.\n\nTempeh is also rich in fiber and antioxidants, promoting heart and gut health and reducing inflammation, she noted. You'll want to marinate or season tempeh to give it more flavor, she added.\n\n2. Firm tofu\n\nFirm tofu provides nine grams of protein per serving, or about 23 grams in half a block, Wells said.\n\nHIGH-PROTEIN BAKED ZITI RECIPE: 'LITTLE SWAPS' MAKE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\"It's also one of the best plant-based sources of calcium, as long as the tofu is calcium-set,\" Wells said.\n\n\"You should see calcium sulfate in the ingredients list.\"\n\nTofu contains iron and magnesium, which are essential for oxygen transport and muscle function, Wells said.\n\nAnother bonus is that tofu is rich in isoflavones, which are antioxidants that help to reduce inflammation and support heart health, she said.\n\nIS PROTEIN MAKING YOU FAT? HEALTH EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON TODAY'S FOOD FOCUS\n\nAs with tempeh, make sure to marinate or season tofu to make it more palatable.\n\n3. Greek yogurt\n\n\"Dairy foods are a non-meat protein source that, because they're still an animal product, provide high-quality, complete protein,\" Amanda Blechman, director of nutrition and scientific affairs at Danone North America in New York, told Fox News Digital.\n\nThese foods deliver adequate amounts of all nine of the essential amino acids – or protein building blocks – that our bodies need but can't make on their own, Blechman said.\n\nGreek yogurt is an affordable protein source, which is especially important to many consumers these days, and a good way to add calcium and vitamin D, Blechman said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nCalcium and vitamin D, together with protein, help promote bone and muscle health, she said, and are considered nutrients of public health concern because most Americans aren't getting enough of them.\n\n4. Beans\n\nBeans, Blechman said, are a nutritious source of plant-based protein.\n\nA cup of black beans, for example, boasts 14 grams of protein and 16 grams of fiber, \"which is important for digestive health and overall wellness,\" she said.\n\nOther nutrients in black beans include around 25% of the recommended daily amount of iron, which is essential for cellular functioning and to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body.\n\nBlack beans, chickpeas and lentils offer 7–9 grams of protein per ½-cup serving, Wells said.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nBeans help regulate blood sugar levels throughout the day and fight chronic inflammation, she added.\n\nSome of Blechman's favorite ways to add beans to her day are to swap kidney beans for meat in chili or black beans for meat in tacos or lasagna, throw a handful of chickpeas on top of salad and make a mashed chickpea salad with yogurt and avocado to enjoy on a sandwich made with whole wheat or sourdough bread.\n\n5. Nuts and seeds\n\nNuts and seeds are another way to get plant-based protein, Blechman said.\n\n\"The amount of protein and other nutrients varies based on the type of nut, but as an example, one ounce of almonds, which is about a fourth of a cup, has around six grams of protein on top of being a good source of other important nutrients like fiber, magnesium and vitamin E,\" Blechman said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMake your own trail mix with your favorite nuts and nutrient-dense seeds like pumpkin, chia, flax or sunflower seeds. Or enjoy a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as \"two tablespoons of peanut butter has around seven grams of protein,\" she said.",

We cannot perform the basic functions of tax collection without paying a toll to all these contractors. We really have to figure out how to get out of this hole. We're in a really deep hole right now,\" DOGE representative Sam Corcos said on \"The Ingraham Angle\" Thursday.\n\nThe \"DOGE bro\" shed light on his work within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to trim the federal government fat alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nTRUMP TREASURY CONFIRMS IT'S EYEING IRS FOR ‘STREAMLINING’ SHAKE-UP AS TAX SEASON HEATS UP\n\nCorcos told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that one of his main priorities during his six-month timeline is to look at the IRS modernization program, as well as other operations and budgets.\n\n\"This is a huge program that's currently 30 years behind schedule, and it's already $15 billion over budget,\" he said. \"The IRS has some pretty legacy infrastructure...and the challenge has been how do we migrate that to a modern system?\"\n\nThe CEO and co-founder of Levels observed that many major banks who ran on similar systems have already modernized. He added the IRS is over three decades behind schedule and billions over budget compared to the typical expectations for the industry.\n\n\"We're now 35 years into this program. If you ask them now, it's five years away, and it's been five years away since 1990. It was supposed to be delivered in 1996, and it's still five years away,\" he said.\n\nBessent, who was recently confirmed as President Donald Trump's treasury secretary, added \"one of the biggest surprises for me is just seeing how these entrenched interests, they just keep constricting themselves around the power, around the money, around the systems, and nobody cares.\"\n\nINSTITUTE THAT HELD OFFICE STANDOFF AGAINST DOGE ON ‘RIGHT PATH' FOLLOWING JUDGE'S ORDER: ADMIN\n\nThe secretary drew attention to another problem facing the nation's top taxation bureau.\n\n\"Many of the employees are fantastic. It's this consultant group. They're like a boa constrictor. They're like a python,\" he said. \"They've constricted themselves around our government, and the costs are unbelievable. They're being passed on to the American taxpayer.\"\n\nCorcos also claimed around 80% of the $3.5 billion IRS operations and maintenance budget goes to contractors and licenses.\n\nThe IRS is one of many federal bureaus and agencies under scrutiny by DOGE and the Trump administration. Since Trump took office, the Musk-led department has aimed at dismantling government bureaucracy, slashing regulations, cutting wasteful spending and restructuring federal agencies.\n\nRecent DOGE actions, however, have been met with mounting scrutiny from many Democrats.\n\n\"The entrenched interests, the consultants, the Democrats, mainstream media, they just want to blow this project out of the water,\" Bessent told Ingraham. \"This is the opposite of government efficiency, not elimination, not extinction. Sam and his crew are making it more efficient to work for the American people. So what's wrong with it working better, cheaper, faster, and with more privacy?\"\n\nBessent said his top three priorities for the tax collecting bureau are \"collections, privacy and customer service,\" and he argued \"None of those are being well served.\"\n\n\"We want people to feel satisfied that they are getting the service they deserve, that they're paying their fair share and not more, not less.

        "title": "Republicans cutting Medicaid would hurt my family — and probably yours",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "I grew up in middle-class America as the daughter of a teacher and a school psychologist, that is to parents who were lucky to receive a reasonable salary and excellent insurance and retirement benefits throughout their careers. They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat’s why I never knew that my parents weren’t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren’t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family’s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad’s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn’t. But given the speed of Mom’s memory decline and the severity of Dad’s chronic illnesses, they couldn’t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what’s called “independent living” for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing — a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn’t know about nursing homes. I didn’t realize, for example, that my parents’ “good” private insurance didn’t cover nursing home care. But that’s fine, I thought; Dad’s old enough for Medicare. That’s when I learned Medicare doesn’t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his “life community,” I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn’t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom’s assisted living. To pay for Dad’s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn’t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn’t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids’ college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn’t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That’s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father’s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I’d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they’ll need Medicaid — until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt’s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move.",

        "content": "UPDATE (March 20, 2025, 5:14 p.m. ET): A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled Thursday that Badar Khan Suri “shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.”\n\nFederal immigration authorities are seeking to deport a Georgetown University graduate student from India, accusing him of spreading Hamas propaganda online and of harboring ties to the U.S.-designated terror group.\n\nBadar Khan Suri, who is in the U.S. on a student visa, was arrested Monday night outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, by agents who said they were with the Department of Homeland Security, his lawyer Hassan Ahmad told NBC News.\n\nAhmad has filed a habeas petition on Suri’s behalf seeking his release from a Louisiana detention facility, where he is currently being held.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, claimed in a post on X that Suri was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and that he “has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”\n\nThe department has not presented details about its allegations against Suri or evidence that he committed any crime, his lawyer said in the petition. Suri has not been charged and has no criminal record, according to Ahmad.\n\nGeorgetown has said that it is not aware of any illegal activity on Suri’s part and that it has not been informed of a reason for his detention.\n\nMcLaughlin said Secretary of State Marco Rubio deemed Suri “deportable” under the same provision that the administration has invoked in its attempt to remove Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. permanent resident, from the country.\n\nAccording to Politico, which first reported Suri’s arrest, Ahmad argued in the petition that Suri is being punished because his wife, a U.S. citizen, is of Palestinian heritage, and because the administration suspects them of opposing U.S. foreign policy toward Israel. The petition also states that Suri’s wife previously worked for Al Jazeera and has been accused of having “ties with Hamas.” (Politico obtained a physical copy of the petition, which is not publicly available and has not been reviewed by MSNBC or NBC News.)\n\nAhmad told The New York Times that although he is still looking into the case, he believed the accusations are connected to Suri’s father-in-law, who the Times reported is a former adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ late political chief. Suri’s father-in-law, who lives in Gaza, told the Times that he left his position in the Hamas government more than a decade ago. He also told the Times that Suri is not involved in any political activism, including on Hamas’ behalf.\n\nAccording to his profile on the university’s website, Suri is a postdoctoral fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. He has a doctorate in peace and conflict studies from the Nelson Mandela Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to detain and deport a number of noncitizens, characterizing them as Hamas sympathizers for their public opposition to Israel’s military assault on Gaza and United States’ support for Israel. Civil rights advocates have said the administration is targeting legal immigrants based on their political views, in violation of their First Amendment rights.",

        "title": "Trump issues executive order seeking to abolish Education Department",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As a presidential candidate in 2024, Donald Trump never came up with a detailed plan related to education policy, but the Republican did make one thing explicitly clear: He wanted to shut down the Education Department if given a second term.\n\nIn September 2023, for example, he released a video, which was posted to social media, in which he vowed to scrap the Cabinet agency “very early in the administration.” He added in March 2024, “It’s time. Close it up.”\n\nAs the president’s second term gets underway, he’s apparently following through on this — or at least taking steps in that direction. On Thursday afternoon, the president did, in fact, sign an executive order designed to start the process of closing the department. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start dismantling the Department of Education. “It sounds strange, doesn’t it? Department of Education. We’re going to eliminate it,” Trump said while speaking in the East Room of the White House at a ceremony where he was flanked by children seated at school desks.\n\nThe order will not literally shutter the agency — a step that would require an act of Congress. Rather, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the Education Department will still perform its “critical functions,” including oversight of student loans.\n\nThe executive order, in other words, will start the dismantling process, but it will not permanently and completely close the department’s doors.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Education Secretary Linda McMahon sending an email to her agency’s staff. The title on the message read, “Our Department’s Final Mission.”\n\nSubtle, it was not. A few days later, McMahon was asked on Fox News whether the country needs her department. “No,” she replied, “we don’t.”\n\nThere’s ample evidence to the contrary. At the federal level, the Education Department is responsible for everything from overseeing a massive federal student loan program to administering grants, from collecting key data used in policymaking to enforcing civil rights laws.\n\nMcMahon, incidentally, will get a different job, Trump announced at the signing event.\n\nThere is no great public appetite for such a dramatic change. In fact, publicly available polling has long suggested the American public is broadly against scrapping the Education Department. In fact, a recent Washington Post analysis noted that while there hasn’t been a lot of recent public opinion research on the issue, “virtually all of the polling ... suggests this is not what the American people want. Indeed, it appears to be among the more unpopular things Trump has pushed for.”\n\nEvidently, the White House is moving forward with its plans anyway, executing a plan that, like so much of Trump's agenda, was part of the right-wing Project 2025 blueprint.",

        "title": "Judge Boasberg to consider ‘consequences’ if Trump officials flouted court orders",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "UPDATE (March 20, 2025; 4:42 p.m. ET): On Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg called the federal government’s latest response to his inquiries “woefully insufficient.” He ordered the government to provide additional information in the coming days, starting with a sworn declaration due Friday at 10:00 a.m. from someone with direct involvement in Cabinet-level discussions regarding the invocation of the state secrets privilege.\n\nA federal judge still has questions about the Trump administration’s compliance with his orders, and the administration is still trying not to answer them.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg gave the government another day to get back to him on the matter. But his latest order suggests he isn’t pleased — or persuaded — by the government’s arguments thus far regarding its deportation flights over the weekend and its litigation conduct since then.\n\nFollowing a hearing Monday at which the government didn’t want to answer Boasberg’s questions, the judge issued an order requiring officials to submit a sealed declaration answering outstanding questions about Saturday’s deportations, which the judge had ordered halted while litigation continues over President Donald Trump’s authority under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThose answers were most recently due by noon Wednesday, but ahead of that deadline, the government asked Boasberg for more time. The request noted that the Justice Department is appealing his orders and said addressing his questions “would undermine the Executive Branch’s ability to negotiate with foreign sovereigns in the future by subjecting all of the arrangements resulting from any such negotiations — as well as the negotiations themselves — to a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.” The government also said it’s evaluating whether to invoke the state secrets privilege regarding information sought by the judge.\n\nIn his latest order on Wednesday, Boasberg wrote that he wasn’t seeking information for a “fishing expedition” but rather “to determine if the Government deliberately flouted” his orders and “if so, what the consequences should be.”\n\nBoasberg expressed doubt about whether the government could successfully keep information under wraps on state secrets grounds, noting that it “appears to be an uncommon occurrence for the disclosure of unclassified information to threaten state secrets.” The judge questioned the purported danger raised by the government about giving him that information in private, observing that the government itself has publicly promoted details of the flights.\n\nAnd the fact that officials are appealing his temporary restraining orders doesn’t affect the judge’s interest in finding out whether the government violated them. He wrote that he’s seeking information “to determine whether the Government complied with the TROs. Whether those TROs were legally defective or legally sound does not govern the compliance inquiry.”\n\nThe most recent order followed Trump’s call for Boasberg’s impeachment and a rare public statement from Chief Justice John Roberts that reiterated that the proper way to respond to an adverse ruling is to appeal it, not to try to impeach the judge. Boasberg seemed to acknowledge that broader issue in his order Wednesday, writing: “As the Supreme Court has made crystal clear, the proper recourse for a party subject to an injunction it believes is legally flawed — and is indeed later shown to be so flawed — is appellate review, not disobedience.”\n\nWhether Boasberg becomes officially convinced that such disobedience has occurred in this case remains to be seen. The administration has a new deadline of noon Thursday to answer his questions or to invoke the state secrets doctrine. Boasberg has already expressed skepticism of how the latter might apply, but even if a state secrets argument is unsuccessful, it could buy the government more time, to the extent that delay is part of its litigation strategy. If instead it attempts to answer his questions, we should learn whether the judge finds those answers satisfactory — and if not, what the “consequences” of such a finding will be.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "The significant implications of Trump’s bid to use the Alien Enemies Act",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "There’s a 12 p.m. ET deadline Thursday for the Trump administration to answer U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s questions about whether officials violated his orders on deportations. But while that crucial issue is pending, there’s also the underlying litigation about what started the class action lawsuit in the first place: President Donald Trump’s attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act to summarily remove people from the country who the government said belong to the gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nAs a reminder, the 1798 act says:\n\nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.\n\nYou’ll notice the reference to a “declared war” or “invasion or predatory incursion” by a foreign nation or government.\n\nSo how, you might wonder, could the act apply if we’re talking about a gang, rather than a nation or government?\n\nTrump’s proclamation said the group is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization whose members “have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.” But however persuasive or not it is to apply the 18th-century law in this situation, his administration has argued that courts lack the power to review or enjoin his proclamation.\n\nIn their latest court filing, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who brought the suit called the implications of Trump’s position “staggering.” The plaintiffs wrote: “If the President can label any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.” They noted that the act has been invoked three times before — all during declared wars.\n\nTheir filing comes in opposition to the government’s motion to vacate Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders halting deportations under the act (the same orders that officials may have violated, which is what Boasberg still has questions about). Opposing that motion, plaintiffs say part of the problem is that the government is simply claiming that the people Trump wants deported are dangerous gang members engaged in an invasion or predatory incursion but without giving them the chance to contest that claim.\n\n“Notably, some Plaintiffs’ asylum claims assert the real fear of harm upon returning even to Venezuela because they fled the very same violent gangs the Government has wrongfully accused them of belonging to,” they wrote to Boasberg, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C. They pointed out that keeping his orders in place wouldn’t mean that people can’t be detained or deported at all, just that Trump wouldn’t be able to use this wartime authority for that purpose here.\n\nWhile the government seeks to convince Boasberg to upend his orders, officials are also trying to get the Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court to halt them, with an appellate hearing set for Monday. The government has even asked the appeals court to kick Boasberg off the case, while Trump has called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nBut in addition to the pending question of whether Boasberg thinks officials have violated his orders — and the important follow-up question of what he’d do about it, if so — there are the “staggering,” to use the plaintiffs’ word, implications of the government’s position overall. The courts therefore have an equally important task of sorting out both the merits of this issue and the government’s compliance with court orders during this litigation.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Over the past several days, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to quell fury within his party over his leadership, stemming largely — but not completely — from his recent support for a Republican-devised spending bill that will impose deep spending cuts to critical federal programs.\n\nSchumer’s appearance Tuesday on “All In with Chris Hayes” proved his critics are right to voice concerns about whether he's up to the challenge of facing off against President Donald Trump's illiberal administration and its allies in Congress.\n\nAfter Hayes showed a supercut of Democrats criticizing Schumer's vote in favor of the bill, the senator insisted that a government shutdown — which would have happened had the spending bill not passed by last Friday's deadline — would give the executive branch maximum power to control and cut federal programs.\n\n“If you don’t have a shutdown, you can go to court,” Schumer said at one point, nodding to one of the few tools Democrats have used to take on the Trump administration’s aggressive cuts. Schumer told Hayes a shutdown would mean giving Republicans “the keys to the city.” Hayes, however, argued a shutdown could have been used as leverage and an opportunity to make Americans understand the seriousness of the Trump administration’s lawlessness.\n\nIt was fair for Schumer to argue, as he did, that he made a tough decision. The problem is that his job isn’t merely to make tough decisions, even if those decisions are the correct ones (and I’m not certain this one was). As the leader of Senate Democrats, his job is arguably to devise and unify his party — and fundamentally, voters who empowered them — around a substantive plan to push back against Trump, amid widespread concerns about Trump’s imposition of what Hayes has rightly called an “American dictatorship.”\n\nAnd Schumer fell short on that front. In the most revealing exchange of the night, he told Hayes he didn’t think the United States is currently in a constitutional crisis, but that we’re “getting there” and that Trump defying a Supreme Court ruling would truly amount to such a crisis.\n\nPolling has shown Democratic Party voters overwhelmingly want leaders in their party to fight harder against Trump’s administration, but Schumer’s claim suggested he doesn’t share their urgency.\n\nIt’s a point Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive activist group Indivisible, made during an interview on \"All In\" immediately following Schumer's appearance.\n\n\"Now that I understand Schumer doesn’t believe we’re yet in a constitutional crisis, his tactical shortcomings make sense,\" Levin told Hayes. \"But his position here is also deeply out of line with rank and file Dems. We need new leadership.\"\n\nOn social media, various liberal activists and commentators let out what was essentially a collective groan over the Schumer interview. The Senate Democratic leader’s support from his party’s base was already unstable. Tuesday’s interview was revelatory — and did little to alleviate concerns from some of his party members.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, Suzanne Collins added another book to her literary pantheon, a prequel to “The Hunger Games” called “Sunrise on the Reaping.” Nearly two decades after the original trilogy was published, “Sunrise on the Reaping” proves how critical and timely the series remains.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” reads like it is aware of its impact and its audience. Collins’ writing is as lyrical and engrossing as it was when “The Hunger Games” debuted 17 years ago; the difference is this new book is born into an already existing cultural dominion. Collins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\nCollins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” centers on Haymitch Abernathy, a complex and misunderstood alcoholic who appears in the original trilogy as Katniss Everdeen’s initially begrudging and then devoted coach and mentor. Collins capitalizes on the familiarity most readers will have with Haymitch’s character to craft a story that deftly examines the power of propaganda and the early stages of authoritarian rule.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” is Collins’ second prequel. The first, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” chronicles President Coriolanus Snow’s journey to becoming the fascist leader of Panem, Collins’ dystopian reimagining of North America. Read together, the two novels illustrate how fascism takes shape: You need the right person and the right environment.\n\nThere are certain elements, structurally and stylistically, that all five books share. Collins breaks her novels into three equal parts, with the same number of chapters. In a rare interview this week with Scholastic’s David Levithan, Collins explained, “I began as a playwright over forty years ago, and that dramatic structure became the template for the novels. … I know certain things I want to achieve by certain points in the story. If I haven’t achieved them, something isn’t working the way I hoped, and I probably need to pause and figure out why.”\n\nStylistically, “The Hunger Games” series makes its reader culpable in the grotesque deaths of tributes, of children. Collins masterfully writes these scenes to be fast-paced, engrossing and detailed. You like reading them. You enjoy the horrifying brutality of the Hunger Games. In this way, the reader is complicit — just as complicit as the series’ wealthy citizens of The Capitol, who watch from safe perches in colorful outfits. Collins also grounds the novel with numerous literary references: Haymitch remembers a William Blake poem, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” is repeated again and again, we have a character named for Emperor Caligula’s horse, and the book opens with four quotes including a reflection from George Orwell.\n\nCollins has a knack for eliciting emotion. Readers across the country posted photos of their tear-streaked faces and puffy eyes on social media after finishing “Sunrise on the Reaping.”\n\nIn 17 years, Collins has created a brutal, grisly and heart-wrenching world that has gripped a generation of readers. Like Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon, an adjective — this is very Hunger Games — used to illustrate government overreach and authoritarianism. “The Hunger Games” series, including “Sunrise on the Reaping,” is a central part in the American dystopian literary canon. Dystopian literature doesn’t look like any one overarching government, environmental catastrophe or mechanism for control. What it all shares is a worst-case-scenario examination that is thought-provoking and engrossing, especially for young readers.\n\nLike Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon.\n\nYoung adult dystopian novels are hugely popular. The runaway success of “The Hunger Games,” with a megahit movie franchise and more than 100 million copies in print, proves that. At a recent meeting of MSNBC’s the Velshi Banned Book Club, Lois Lowry, author of one of the first young adult dystopian novels to captivate the nation, “The Giver,” attributes the success of the genre — and its widespread bans and removals — to the young protagonists. In the pages of these books, it is the young hero, the underdog, who enacts societal change. “A young person has perceived the hypocrisy and corruption of the governance of the generation that has created their world,” Lowry said.\n\nThe propaganda commentary at the center of “Sunrise on the Reaping” reminded me of early August when Elon Musk reposted a popular meme that regularly circulates online: “You watched ‘The Hunger Games’ and sided with the resistance. … When it’s fiction you understand. Yet you refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in. Wild.” Seventy-four million people viewed the post. Many of them reacted negatively, calling Musk, and his wealth and influence, The Capitol. This isn’t the only time men of undue and dangerous influence have twisted Collins’ story in and attempt to use it for their own benefit. If nothing else, it proves the power of literature, particularly this genre of literature, to influence and inspire. In the brutal world of Panem, the narrative must be controlled. And off the page? The narrative must be distorted.",

        "title": "Trump’s FTC firings underscore his commitment to big businesses and billionaires",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump attempted to fire the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission, even though he can only fire the congressionally-appointed commissioners for cause. It marks a very sudden end — at least for now — to the agency’s efforts to enforce antitrust laws and consumer protections. And it’s another sign Donald Trump is governing not on behalf of the people but for the benefit of America’s biggest and most powerful businesses and billionaires. Furthermore, if the courts uphold this action — a big if — it will endanger the independence of every government agency that is designed to be insulated from day-to-day political White House pressures.\n\nWhy Trump decided to do this is a mystery. The FTC has five members, three from the president’s political party and two from the opposition. It’s not as though the two jettisoned commissioners controlled the FTC — they represented the minority Democratic Party. Earlier this week, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson defended the structure of the FTC on the Bloomberg podcast Odd Lots: “If you have an agency that is exceeding the law, abusing the companies that it purports to regulate, it’s helpful for markets, for courts, for litigants, for government transparency to have people in the other party pointing this out.”\n\nThis is corruption, plain and simple.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya\n\nOf course, that’s almost certainly the point of ditching the two commissioners. For decades, antitrust law was ignored and dismissed by administrations from both parties and even by those who were charged with enforcing those laws. Biden-era FTC Chair Lina Khan reinvigorated and restored antitrust law (and was reviled by billionaires and many on Wall Street as a result). Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic commissioners Trump wants to deep-six, are committed to her vision.\n\nUnder Khan, the FTC sued Amazon in two separate civil suits, alleging, among other things, that the company is using monopoly power over the smaller businesses that sell through their site to raise prices across the internet. The two commissioners are responsible for enforcing a privacy consent decree against X. At the same time, agency staff began strengthening internet privacy rules — something that affects platforms like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. They were also in the early stages of attempting to bring America’s soaring pharmaceutical prices under control. And the agency is suing the country’s three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), alleging they colluded to increase the price of insulin.\n\nAll of these FTC actions are presumably in deep jeopardy as the remaining Republican commissioners’ commitment to this agenda is tenuous at best. Trump campaigned on cracking down on PBMs, bringing down the cost of living and corralling Big Tech. These are all of huge importance to the Democratic commissioners, yet the White House claimed in their note to Bedoya and Slaughter, “Your continued service on the F.T.C. is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.”\n\nIt’s hard to see how — unless that is, you view it in the greater context of Big Tech and Big Business warmly embracing Trump. X owner Elon Musk donated more than $250 million to get him elected, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave generously to his inauguration committee, and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos bought the rights to a Melania Trump documentary and purchased streaming rights to all 15 seasons of \"The Apprentice,\" pouring millions upon millions of dollars directly into the Trump family coffers. All have been rewarded with White House access and, in Musk’s case, the opportunity to slash the federal government bureaucracy and fire government workers at a whim.\n\n“This is corruption, plain and simple,” Bedoya said on a Tuesday night press call. “Who does this attempt to remove us help? Because it doesn’t help regular people trying to, struggling to pay the bills and struggling to pay the rent. Who it helps is billionaires, and I think it opens the door for corruption, and for a law enforcement apparatus that is controlled not by the law, but by money.”\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad.\n\nBut there’s something else possibly happening here, too. Almost a century ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire a Republican-appointed member of the FTC. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a president can only fire congressionally appointed agency heads for cause. Disagreement isn’t good enough. Trump’s actions are not only illegal and unlawful, but they threaten other government agencies — including, crucially from Wall Street’s perspective, the Federal Reserve. If the Supreme Court rules that Trump can jettison the FTC commissioners — yes, this is heading to court — who's to say he’ll stop there? “If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired,” Slaughter said Tuesday on CNBC.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad. The politicization of regulation and policy is, by definition, destabilizing to the greater economy. Decisions that appear to be made for the benefit of favored oligarchs do not make for a healthy business environment, which demands a fair application of the rule of law. It enables a corrupt economy, where money and power flow to the very top, and the rest of us, individuals and smaller honest businesses alike, are seen as so much prey. This is what Khan, Bedoya and Slaughter attempted to stop and put in reverse.\n\nOligarchs — from either party — who are used to operating without checks on their power never want cops on the beat. We saw it during the presidential election when billionaire supporters of Kamala Harris tried to bully her into committing to ditching Khan if she won, and we saw it again earlier this year when the Trump administration attempted to destroy the Consumer Federation Protection Bureau. Now, it’s playing out at the FTC, where the Trump administration is willing to break the law to get the white-collar cops to stand down.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, some eligible New Hampshire voters experienced significant roadblocks to participating in the state’s first elections since it enacted a law that requires a birth certificate, passport, or other proof of citizenship to register to vote. The mess provided a preview of the steep hurdles prospective voters across the country will face if Congress passes the SAVE Act, a bill that will imperil Americans’ ability to participate in elections.\n\nFor one voter in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, satisfying the state’s new requirements was like a bad visit to the DMV. Betsy Spencer, 70, told New Hampshire Public Radio that it took multiple attempts over several hours with different documents proving her citizenship to re-register to vote on Election Day (New Hampshire is one of 23 states that allows same-day voter registration). Among other problems, her birth certificate didn’t match her married name. Spencer wasn’t the only one to experience difficulties: other voters who needed to register reported being turned away because they didn’t bring a birth certificate, passport, or other proof of citizenship with them to the polls. While some returned with the required proof to vote, others did not.\n\nThis would effectively end mail registration, online registration, and voter registration drives.\n\nIf the SAVE Act becomes law, voters nationwide will face similar problems to those in New Hampshire, if not worse. Like the New Hampshire law, the federal SAVE Act would require voters to show a document like a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers in person to an election official to register to vote. But the federal version would be even stricter than the New Hampshire law. Our research shows that at least 21 million American citizens don’t have ready access to those documents. The SAVE Act’s show-your-papers requirement would block millions of American citizens from voting, and it would be especially burdensome for young Americans and Americans of color.\n\nThe bill could also jeopardize voting access for tens of millions of married women who have changed their last names. Roughly 80 percent of American women in opposite-sex marriages took their husband’s last name, according to a 2023 Pew study. Yet the bill doesn’t address what happens when a person’s legal name is different than the name on their birth certificate or passport.\n\nThe SAVE Act’s damage would extend beyond the millions of American citizens who don’t have ready access to citizenship documents. Eligible voters would be required to present their citizenship documentation in person to an election official both when they register the first time and anytime they need to re-register.\n\nThis would effectively end mail registration, online registration, and voter registration drives — all extremely popular and convenient methods American voters rely on. Between 2018 and 2022, these three ways to register accounted for about one in every three registrations nationally, according to the Election Administration and Voting Survey. In the two years before the 2020 presidential election alone, more than 37 million people either registered for the first time or updated their registration using one of these methods, the survey found.\n\nThe reality is that federal and state laws are already in place to ensure that only eligible U.S. citizens vote, and carry steep penalties for those who violate them. Yet, the House is currently expected to take up the bill during the week of March 31.\n\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law to eradicate racial discrimination in voting and expand access to the ballot box for people of color. If Congress were to enact the SAVE Act, it would be an unprecedented departure from its longstanding commitment to protecting the freedom to vote. Congress should not turn its back on this duty. The SAVE Act is a voter suppression bill. It would keep many millions of eligible American citizens on the sidelines of our democracy. It must never become law.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A newly unearthed memo from the Trump administration calls to mind the infamous words of the late segregationist and Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who said at his inauguration in 1963, “I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever.” Now the message of a recent Trump administration memo seems to be “segregation again.”\n\nNPR reports that a memo issued by the administration in February omits federal guidelines that prevent contractors from receiving federal funds if they operate segregated facilities.\n\nPer the report:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination.\n\nThe disappearance of the language doesn’t alter the fact that federal law, including the Civil Rights Act, and some state laws still ban segregation and other forms of discrimination in all businesses. MSNBC contributor Melissa Murray told NPR the move was “meaningful in its symbolism” because these provisions “were all part of the federal government’s efforts to facilitate the settlement that led to integration in the 1950s and 1960s.”\n\nStudies have shown that racial segregation persists in various aspects of life, including housing and education, despite federal and state laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Kirk, a far-right influencer and close Trump ally, has argued the Civil Rights Act was a “mistake.” And the person Trump has nominated to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, far-right lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, doesn’t inspire confidence that the administration will prioritize cases involving claims of segregation.\n\nBut the symbolism of the administration’s retracting its prohibition on contractors’ operating segregated facilities is also a message: When the government explicitly says it won’t do business with segregationists, that discourages segregation. When it doesn’t explicitly say that, it provides a permission structure for segregation to occur.\n\nWith his tariffs, Trump is threatening to drag the U.S. back into the disastrous economic policies of the 1890s. This retraction of anti-segregation guidelines adds to a heaping pile of evidence that he’s looking to replicate that era’s social policies, too.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With several of President Donald Trump’s policies now making their way through the legal system, judges who have ruled against the administration are facing increased threats of violence and impeachment.\n\nSeveral judges have raised alarm about the rise in threats that they and their colleagues have received, warning that it is a long-term trend across presidential administrations.\n\nBut Trump and his allies’ recent attacks on the judiciary are likely exacerbating the problem.\n\nAccording to an investigation of several online social platforms by the nonprofit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, calls for impeachment and violence rose 54% in February from the previous month, with some commenters using slurs against certain judges and others calling for them to be executed over their court decisions.\n\nThose threats, the group said, are “inspired in part by attacks on judges by President Trump, his close allies, including Elon Musk, and some in the GOP.”\n\nTrump has been incredibly vocal about his disdain for judges who have made rulings unfavorable to his administration. He has gone so far as to call for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered the White House to halt its haphazard effort to deport Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTrump’s attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but the president’s allies have nevertheless piled on.\n\nTrump’s attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but the president’s allies have nevertheless piled on. GOP members of Congress who expressed support for impeaching judges who rule against the administration have also reportedly received a boost in donations from Musk, Trump’s billionaire ally, who on Wednesday baselessly accused those judges of “extreme abuse of the legal system.”\n\nSome of those threats have made their way offline. The New York Times reported that judges have received bomb threats, swatting calls and even anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes as a veiled intimidation tactic.\n\nJudges’ family members have also been targeted. Earlier this month, the sister of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett — who has come under fire from MAGA supporters over her recent rulings against the administration — was the target of a pipe bomb threat at her home, according to police in Charleston, South Carolina. The threat was determined to be a false alarm, police said.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s team is effective at using fiery rhetoric, which often includes lies, to paint his opponents as villains and to manufacture crises they insist only he can solve. Take the current fracas over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants whose alleged gang ties led Trump to declare them terrorists.\n\nThe debate reached fever pitch Wednesday, when Attorney General Pam Bondi, in an appearance on Fox News, launched an incendiary attack on so-called liberal U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of \"meddling in our government.\" Bondi said, \"And the question should be, why is the judge trying to protect terrorists who invaded our country over American citizens?”\n\nThat’s quite the statement. Rather, it's empty rhetoric not supported by facts.\n\nWhoa, nelly. That’s quite the statement. Rather, it's empty rhetoric not supported by facts.\n\nWhat’s especially pernicious is Bondi’s arrogant use of “our government” — as if the federal judiciary is not a co-equal branch of government. There’s an old-fashioned, but still appropriate idea that the public is best served when the Department of Justice speaks through its court filings. It’s also outrageous for Bondi to launch a verbal assault against a federal judge amidst an increased wave of violent threats.\n\nNone of this is normal.\n\nBut this is how Bondi rolls. In less than two months, the attorney general, who’s sworn to protect and defend all of us, has gained a reputation for just offering red meat to MAGA conservatives, whether lying about crime rates or mocking Hunter Biden at partisan political conferences or shattering norms by appearing exclusively on one conservative TV network every week of her tenure. She first proved herself in 2020, embracing Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She even travelled to Pennsylvania and made claims of “evidence of cheating” and “fake ballots” that didn’t exist.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Bondi the MAGA warrior would viciously attack Boasberg, a nonpartisan judge who was appointed to a seat on the D.C. Superior Court by Republican President George W. Bush. When President Barack Obama nominated him for a federal judgeship a decade later, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him.\n\nJudge Boasberg is neither a knee-jerk liberal nor a died-in-the-wool conservative. He has issued rulings that Trump supported, such as when he ordered the FBI to release thousands of emails belonging to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and he has issued rulings that Trump opposed, such as cleared the way for former Vice President Mike Pence to provide grand jury testimony in DOJ’s investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. In law school, “this Democrat activist,” as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrongly labeled him this week, roomed with now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who presided over his investiture.\n\nContrary to Bondi’s incendiary rhetoric that Judge Boasberg has “no right to ask those questions,” the truth is he has the right and is right to ask hard questions of the president’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. The law was last used following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II to relocate and incarcerate thousands of people of Japanese ancestry in the U.S. The Trump administration has provided no proof — to the court or anybody else — that the individuals detained and deported are in fact violent gang members in the country illegally. They’re telling the court and the public, but not showing us the proof, as MSNBC’s Ali Vitali observed.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why Judge Boasberg would have some questions, given the Trump administration’s “shoot first, ask questions later” sloppy approach to government. Like when they mistakenly declared a Seattle man dead and stopped his Social Security benefits; or abruptly fired (and then rehired) hundreds highly trained federal employees working on the nation’s nuclear weapons programs. Or inadvertently released Social Security numbers and other private information of former congressional staff. The list of things they should be questioned about is long.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why Judge Boasberg would have questions, given the Trump administration’s sloppy approach to government.\n\nBut none of this matters to the Trump administration, which senses a political opening. And on the underlying question — the removal of any violent undocumented immigrant from the country — he has the support of most Americans, including Democrats. In fact, immigration/border security is the only major issue in which the majority of Americans approve of how Trump is handling it, according NBC News polling. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of the issue, while 43% disapprove. A clear majority, 56%, say he’s bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue.\n\nBut even policies that the American people approve of must be carried out according to the law, and, as Judge Boasberg is working to determine if applicable laws were followed, Trump and his administration are sowing discord for his political benefit.\n\nAnd Bondi’s part in sowing that discord includes her characterizing as an offense the sacred obligation that a judge, and indeed every member of a co-equal branch government, has to ensure that we all live up to our constitutional responsibilities.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the federal judge adjudicating a challenge to recent deportation orders a “Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator” and called for his impeachment. In response to this and other, similar attacks on judges, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took the extraordinary step of issuing a public statement condemning such attacks.\n\nAs the chief justice explained in his statement, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nThis could be a signal that Roberts might not be willing to rule with the Trump administration when it comes to its many forays into seemingly unconstitutional territory. And not a moment too soon.\n\nLike most chief justices who have preceded him, Roberts tends to let his judicial opinions deliver his messages. This time, as the Trump administration’s attacks on the courts are growing, we face the likelihood of seeing federal officials defy court orders in the very near future (if they haven’t done so already). That’s why the chief justice’s statements couldn’t come at a better (or more perilous) time for the rule of law, which seems constantly under threat.\n\nFederal judges, like many other federal officials, are subject to removal from their otherwise lifetime appointments through impeachment. Removal of federal judges through impeachment is very rare, however. It has happened only five times over the last 100 years and typically for things like outright corruption. The purpose behind the lifetime appointment of federal judges and the high bar of impeachment is, as Alexander Hamilton explained, to insulate judges from the political winds and outside pressure.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton argued in Federalist 78 that not just independence, but also “complete independence of the courts” was “peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution,” one in which other branches were constrained by the Constitution and the courts had to help enforce those constraints.\n\nThe recent attacks on judges fly in the face of this “complete independence.”\n\nSince the start of Trump’s second administration, calls for impeachment have emanated from members of Congress, Elon Musk and now from the president himself. What is more, we seem to be headed for a significant constitutional crisis over whether the Trump administration is willing to defy court orders.\n\nThis could be a signal that Roberts might not be willing to rule with the Trump administration when it comes to its many forays into seemingly unconstitutional territory.\n\nAlmost at the same time that the chief justice was issuing his statement, in a courthouse down the street, lawyers for the federal government were trying to defend the actions of the administration over the weekend, when it seemed they might have ignored a direct order of another judge, this one from James Boasberg, the chief judge of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This is the same judge Trump called a “radical left lunatic,” who just happened to have been confirmed by the Senate in a 96-0 vote in 2011.\n\nIn that case, Judge Boasberg had directed the government to stop its deportation of hundreds of migrants without due process of law, including directing the government to turn any planes around that might contain such migrants and might have already taken off.\n\nDespite some defiant statements over the last few days that the court had no power to issue such orders or that the government didn’t have to obey them, lawyers were in court Tuesday afternoon trying to explain that the actions of the federal government weren’t actually in contravention of the court’s order. Their position in court has been very different from the bold statements from several Trump officials, made to the media, that the administration could simply flout the court’s directives.\n\nWhile it is obviously critical for the chief justice to speak up against unconscionable attacks on judges because they might disagree with the Trump administration over the law — which is all that the judges who have been attacked so far have done — the Roberts defense could signal that he may serve as a bulwark on the court against the more extreme positions of the Trump administration more generally and the arguments raised by its lawyers.\n\nWhen an emergency application came before the Supreme Court over cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, at first Roberts issued an administrative stay of a lower court order to give the entire court a chance to consider the Trump administration’s request to enable it to continue to devastate this agency. That gave some court watchers pause, and many expressed concerns that the Trump administration would be unleashed to take action against not just USAID but also other government agencies.\n\nSeveral days later, though, the entire court ruled, with Roberts in the majority (with Justice Amy Coney Barrett and the three liberal justices), to allow the lower court’s order protecting USAID to take effect once again.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in 2005, Roberts famously said his job was to “call balls and strikes,” like an umpire in a baseball game, and not to set the strike zone. Perhaps he realizes now that he has to do more than sit by impassively passing judgment, however. Perhaps he is starting to understand that without a sustained, vocal and affirmative defense of the judiciary, he might find that there might be little left to adjudicate in the event the branch whose job it is to “say what the law is,” as former Chief Justice John Marshall once said, finds itself hobbled and silenced by such overt threats to the rule of law.",

        "content": "In a Fox News interview that aired on Wednesday, Donald Trump admitted that he worries his plan to invent and distribute so-called golden visas to people willing to pay a $5 million fee could cause \"unsavory people\" to come to the United States.\n\nWhile he's argued that the \"gold visa\" proposal would spur investment in the U.S., Trump acknowledged on Fox News that there may be downsides, though he promised to kick out any immigrants if he learns of wrongdoing.\n\nIn the interview, Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Trump if he's \"worried about any unsavory people coming in.\"\n\n“Yeah, I’m worried about unsavory — in which case we’re gonna give ‘em the money back and they get out,” Trump replied. He also said, when pressed, that the visa holders would be \"properly vetted\" but seemingly started to add a caveat. \"You know, when you're talking about a lot of people — I think it's gonna be very successful.\"\n\nTrump has proposed the gold visas as a juiced-up replacement of the EB-5 visa, which already exists to allow foreign investors to obtain a green card if they invest at least $1.05 million in the U.S. Other countries with similar \"golden passports\" include Austria, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe proposal came even as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, targeted legal immigrants for deportation and contracted with El Salvador to send some deportees to a notorious prison complex.\n\nIn the interview, Ingraham also asked Trump why U.S. citizenship should be on sale \"for any amount of money\" and how it fit with his \"America First\" philosophy. Trump responded that he proposed the idea because he’s “America First,” claiming without evidence that the policy might even bring as many as 1 million new immigrants.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, Rotimi Adeoye laid out the moral and ethical objections to the proposal:\n\nIn Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with “golden visa” programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nCritics have been outspoken in laying out their worries about this golden visa plan. But the Fox News interview shows that even Trump is concerned that the new visas could be abused and he has no real plan to stop that.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration is waging an authoritarian assault on civil rights as it targets universities — institutions often reviled by right-wingers — and tries to deport an activist who’s a legal permanent resident of the United States, all under the guise of thwarting antisemitism.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the most prominent influencers in the conservative movement are praising Nazi apologists and defending Adolf Hitler.\n\nAn aptly named blog that closely tracks far-right extremism, AngryWhiteMen.org, published a detailed report on MAGA-aligned podcaster Joe Rogan’s recent praise for a Nazi apologist named Daryl Cooper, who faced fierce condemnation last year for defending Nazi Germany in a podcast interview with Tucker Carlson. On the podcast, Rogan promoted a variation of the racist and antisemitic “replacement theory” while discussing immigration and defended Cooper from allegations of Nazi apologism, saying his work is “very valuable to me, and it’s very valuable to human beings that want to hear this nuanced, comprehensive perspective on these conflicts.”\n\nThe AngryWhiteMen blog also recently published a thorough report on popular conservative influencer Jake Shields’ abhorrent claim that Hitler “wasn’t pushing hatred towards other races.”\n\nAnd these aren’t isolated incidents. Hitler-loving rapper Ye and white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, whom Donald Trump hosted for dinner in 2022, were both seen this week in a since-deleted video posted by Ye on X, in which the rapper was wearing a swastika necklace seemingly made out of diamonds.\n\nAnd Leo Terrell, the former Fox News contributor tapped to lead Trump’s so-called antisemitism task force, recently shared a prominent white nationalist’s tweet saying the president can “revoke someone’s Jew card,” in response to a tweet with footage of Trump’s antisemitic claim that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “used to be Jewish — he’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.”\n\nAll this to say: Don’t be gaslit. As the Trump administration uses claims of antisemitism to crack down on civil rights, the president is leading a movement growing more emboldened in its support for Nazi apologists, Nazi ideology and Hitler himself.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "At a recent White House event, Donald Trump told reporters that he hoped the stock price for Elon Musk’s Tesla would go up, but the president did not explicitly urge the public to purchase shares in the company.\n\nA member of the Republican’s Cabinet, however, was far more direct. As The New York Times noted:\n\nThe commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, followed President Trump by supporting Elon Musk, urging people to buy shares in Tesla, Musk’s car company. ‘It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again,’ Lutnick said Wednesday on Fox News. ... Tesla’s stock price has plummeted in the last two months as it faces backlash, including protests and vandalism, over Musk’s role in the Trump administration.\n\nThe Cabinet secretary did not appear to be kidding.\n\nI’m mindful that breaches of norms and ethical limits have become routine over the last two months, but this was an egregious display, even by 2025 standards.\n\nRight off the bat, let’s note that it’s not the commerce secretary’s job to give the public investment advice. But given the relevant circumstances, that’s where the problems start, not where they end. Making matters far worse, Lutnick — who was confirmed by the Senate and holds an important position of public trust — took it upon himself to urge a national television audience to buy a specific stock tied to the sitting president’s top campaign donor.\n\nIf his Democratic predecessor, Gina Raimondo, took such a step, urging Americans to buy stock in a company led by Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor, it seems likely that more than a few congressional Republicans would've called for her resignation.\n\nOf course, Lutnick has plenty of company. Trump didn’t just give Musk enormous power in his administration, the president also hosted what was effectively an infomercial for Tesla on the White House South Lawn after the company’s stock value had dropped sharply.\n\nMore recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared on Fox Business and declared, “If you’re gonna touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out, because we’re coming after you.”\n\nSoon after, The New York Times reported that Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Musk’s SpaceX, has been “routed through a White House data center.”\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, Politico reported, “A top Commerce Department official sent a blistering email to his former colleagues on his way out the door Sunday warning that the Trump administration is poised to unduly enrich Elon Musk’s satellite internet company with money for rural broadband. The technology offered by Starlink, Musk’s company, is inferior, wrote Evan Feinman, who had directed the $42.5 billion broadband program for the past three years.”\n\nIf there’s a benign defense for all of this, I can’t think of it.",

        "title": "Democrats are failing to meet the moment amid Trump’s unconstitutional power grab",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 19 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nThe movement to resist Donald Trump’s unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions: How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined “All In.” The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis — that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday’s show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader “meeting the moment” if they don’t believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump’s intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission, these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump’s whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it’s not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump’s will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one, for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end — when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats — one that is not totally wrong — that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues, like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump’s trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don’t think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n‘This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,’ Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don’t have to choose. It’s all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump’s entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer’s Democratic colleagues believe it’s time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n“This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,” Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday. “And I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that’s a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there’s a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets — not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people — if we’re not willing to take risks ourselves?”\n\nNow is the time to take political risks — before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American.",

        "title": "Elon Musk’s Pentagon briefing to include information on China, sparking controversy",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A few weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, the president announced he was deploying Elon Musk, his top campaign donor, to conduct an audit of the Pentagon, which quickly became controversial for reasons the Republican didn’t appear to understand.\n\nMusk, among other things, is a defense contractor who does business with governments around the world. Common sense and a basic understanding of ethics would suggest just about anyone else would be better suited to oversee an audit of the Department of Defense’s finances.\n\nA month later, the billionaire megadonor is preparing to visit the Pentagon, where Musk will apparently receive a notable briefing. NBC News reported:\n\nTech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk is scheduled to visit the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that will include a discussion on China, according to three defense officials. The officials said the briefing will be unclassified, two of the officials said.\n\nAt this point, it’s worth pausing to note the variety of reports on this from several prominent news organizations, many of which included provocative details that haven’t been confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News.\n\nThe Washington Post, for example, reported that the Pentagon will provide Musk with an unclassified briefing focused in part “on the threat posed by China,” adding that China will be “the main focus of the discussion.” The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledging that he’d meet with Musk, but the discussion, according to the far-right former Fox News host, would emphasize “innovation” and “efficiencies.”\n\nOther outlets, however, pointed in an even more alarming direction. The Wall Street Journal, for example, reported that Musk is poised to receive information on “the U.S. military’s top-secret war plans for China,” including “maritime tactics and targeting plans.” The Journal’s report, citing two unnamed U.S. officials, noted that the briefing — which is being held at the billionaire’s request — could give Musk “access to sensitive military secrets unavailable to business competitors.”\n\nFinally, there’s The New York Times’ report, which included details that dovetail with the Journal’s reporting, noting that the briefing would include information on “the U.S. military’s plan for any war that might break out with China.”\n\nThe Times added that this briefing, if it proceeds, “would also bring into sharp relief the questions about Mr. Musk’s conflicts of interest as he ranges widely across the federal bureaucracy while continuing to run businesses that are major government contractors. In this case, Mr. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of both SpaceX and Tesla, is a leading supplier to the Pentagon and has extensive financial interests in China.”\n\nIt’s that last point that is of particular interest. Musk isn’t just a billionaire and Republican megadonor. He also isn’t just overseeing a quasi-governmental “department” in the executive branch. Musk is also businessman with extensive financial interests in China and close contacts with China’s government.\n\nAll of which is to say, providing Musk with sensitive military information about China represents a profound and unnecessary risk.\n\nFor his part, Trump published an item to his social media platform insisting that China “will not even be mentioned or discussed” during the DOGE chief’s visit to the Defense Department. Of course, if the president still had any credibility, such a denial might be more convincing. (The Republican added soon after, \"Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\" The War Department became the Defense Department in 1949.)\n\nPolitico noted that Musk responded to the developments with threatening rhetoric, writing online that he looks “forward to the prosecution of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information” to the Times. “They will be found,” he added.",

        "content": "The Trump administration confirmed Wednesday that it has slashed funds for a research program that had been tracking children believed to have been abducted during Russia’s deadly invasion of Ukraine. The move delivers a tremendous gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nCNN reports a State Department spokesperson said the administration cut funding for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, run out of Yale University, which had been documenting possible war crimes committed by Putin’s army. The group relied on a database to compile evidence related to “the abduction of the Ukrainian children ... attacks on energy infrastructure, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and destruction of cultural sites.”\n\nPer the report:\n\nThe database was specifically structured to pull together relevant elements for prosecution of war crimes, the source said. It is unclear who has access to the database, what will happen to the critical evidence it holds, and whether it will be able to be shared with the entities like the European Union law enforcement agency Europol.\n\nTrump’s administration is taking offline a powerful tool that was being used to hold Putin accountable, while simultaneously making it more difficult to reunite as many as 30,000 Ukrainian children with their families. It’s still unclear whether the data that’s already been compiled is still recoverable, according to CNN’s report.\n\nIt’s a sinister move by an administration that has been disturbingly deferential to Russia as of late, even by Trump’s standards. My colleague Steve Benen wrote about reports (unconfirmed by NBC News or MSNBC) that the administration has suspended efforts to counter Russian sabotage attempts, cyberattacks and attempts to spread disinformation. Just last month, Trump caused an embarrassing scene in the Oval Office in a televised meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, doing damage to the relationship and the U.S.’s standing on the world stage. More recently the administration acquiesced to a Kremlin demand that Trump’s Ukraine-Russia envoy, former Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, be excluded from the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, on the grounds that Kellogg is too supportive of Ukraine.\n\nIt’s abundantly clear why some Russian media figures could hardly contain their glee when Trump started assembling his Cabinet this year. They could not have engineered a more pro-Russian president than Donald Trump.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This summer will mark 10 years since Donald Trump first descended the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.\n\nNow, two months into his second term, it’s becoming painfully clear that many of the people best positioned to push back against his agenda still haven't accepted how much the world has changed.\n\nThe latest example came from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in \"Mad House,\" an upcoming book from Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of The New York Times, which revealed a 2023 exchange in which he said Trump was an aberration.\n\n“Here’s my hope … after this election, when the Republican Party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican Party,\" he said, according to the book.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this quote other than its needlessly vivid imagery.\n\nI remember the “old” Republican Party well. I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party’s nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump’s acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell. Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney’s physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife’s appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a “sniveling coward.” Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump’s brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today’s Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists — all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don’t want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others’ depravity because they know today’s Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights, now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people’s bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state.\n\nEven Trump’s most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there’s Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "content": "As international fears of Russian sabotage campaigns grow, common sense might suggest that U.S. officials would be ramping up its efforts to combat Moscow’s tactics. According to a Reuters report, however, the Trump administration is doing largely the opposite.\n\nSeveral U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks, easing pressure on Moscow as the Trump Administration pushes Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, Biden administration officials briefed the incoming Trump administration during the transition period, urging the Republican team “to continue monitoring Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign.”\n\nAfter Donald Trump’s inauguration, however, “much of the work has come to a standstill,” Reuters added. The same report went on to say, “Some officials involved in the working groups said they are concerned that the Trump administration is de-prioritizing the issue despite intelligence warnings. The change follows the unwinding of other Russia-focused projects launched by Biden’s administration.”\n\nIt’s that last point that’s of particular interest. The Reuters report, in isolation, is unsettling. But considered in a broader context, the pattern paints an even more alarming image.\n\nLast week, for example, Vladimir Putin and his regime let U.S. officials know that they did not want retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg — the White House’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia — to be involved in ceasefire negotiations. Trump promptly reassigned him. Around the same time, the White House abandoned the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe developments were hardly unfamiliar:\n\nAnd did I mention that Senate Republicans, at Trump’s behest, confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s director of national intelligence, despite her habit of echoing Russian propaganda? Because that happened, too.\n\nWhat’s more, this list might yet grow. Reuters also recently reported that the administration is also eyeing an overhaul to existing U.S. sanctions on Russia.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario in which Putin spoke privately to Trump and provided the American president with a to-do list. Would it look much different than the White House’s agenda from the last two months?\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "As Elon Musk rewards judicial impeachment advocates, Jim Jordan eyes hearings",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "After the Trump administration lost yet another court fight this week, his top campaign donor, Elon Musk, turned to a familiar complaint. “This is a judicial coup,” the Republican megadonor wrote by way of his social media platform. “We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people.”\n\nAs my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained soon after, Musk flubbed every relevant detail in his missive: It’s not a “coup” when the White House loses court fights; senators aren’t responsible for impeaching anyone; and the standard for removing a sitting judge from the bench is 67 votes, not 60.\n\nBut despite his lack of familiarity with the impeachment process, the billionaire has been pushing the idea of judicial impeachments with unnerving vigor in recent weeks. Indeed, NBC News noted Wednesday that Musk had posted online about judicial impeachments “17 times within the past 24 hours.”\n\nWhat’s more, as The New York Times reported, he’s also putting his money where his tweets are.\n\nElon Musk has made the maximum allowable donation to Republican members of Congress who support impeaching federal judges who are impeding actions taken by President Trump, according to five people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Musk has given what had been until recently the legal maximum hard-dollar donation — $6,600 — to the campaigns of seven Republicans who have either endorsed judicial impeachments or called for some form of ‘action’ in response to recent rulings against the Trump administration, including a weekend decision by Judge James E. Boasberg of Federal District Court in Washington.\n\nAccording to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the beneficiaries of the campaign contributions include Republican Reps. Eli Crane of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin and Brandon Gill of Texas. Unexpectedly, Musk also donated to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who hasn’t explicitly endorsed impeaching any judges, but who did criticize a recent court ruling in the Alien Enemies Act case.\n\nTo be sure, the legal maximum for hard-dollar donations is rather modest — for someone of Musk’s wealth, $6,600 checks will not be missed — but there’s a broader political significance: The DOGE chief just sent an unsubtle signal to members of Congress that judicial impeachment advocates on Capitol Hill should expect to be rewarded by the biggest GOP megadonor of them all.\n\nPolitico also reported, “House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan said he plans to hold hearings on recent judicial rulings against the Trump administration’s agenda, after President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and conservatives have called for impeaching federal judges.”\n\nThe Ohio Republican told CNN, “We’re gonna hold hearings on this entire issue,” adding that he's especially interested in “the 15 injunctions that have been done in an eight-week time frame.”\n\nOf course, as we’ve discussed, that the White House has faced so many injunctions in so little time is less evidence of judicial bias and more evidence of an administration that keeps pushing the legal envelope in radical and unprecedented ways.\n\nNevertheless, Team Trump wants the idea of judicial impeachments to be taken seriously, and evidently the Jordan-led House Judiciary Committee is prepared to examine the issue in more detail.\n\nThere are, however, apparently some divisions among GOP lawmakers. In a separate report this week, Politico quoted one House Republican saying, “I do not support impeaching a sitting judge based solely on a decision with which I disagree.”\n\nThat the unnamed member didn’t want to be identified speaks volumes about the current state of the party.",

        "title": "John Roberts and Elon Musk are both wrong about Trump's push to impeach judges",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has always had a skeptical view of judicial independence. He’s long praised those who rule in his favor as wise jurists while denouncing any who rule against him as biased and not worthy of their robes. But he reached a new low in this area on Tuesday, when he called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to be impeached for halting his attempts to ship Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.\n\nThis escalation added fuel to an already simmering debate on the right about how to respond to federal judges who block Trump’s agenda. Chief Justice John Roberts and billionaire Elon Musk have weighed in on opposite sides of Trump’s call to impeach Boasberg. And both Musk’s and Roberts’ positions are wrong.\n\nBoth Musk’s and Roberts’ positions are wrong.\n\nThe chief justice prompted breaking news push alerts on Tuesday when he issued a rare statement criticizing Trump’s call for impeachment. “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” he wrote. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts has loved to hunt for the smallest nuance that can leave him technically correct. And here, again, he does have a point. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution says federal judges “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” This has been interpreted as granting them essentially lifetime appointments, in which they can’t just be replaced because political control changes hands in Washington.\n\nThe exception, of course, is when federal judges are impeached, something that has happened 15 times since the nation’s founding. Article II of the Constitution lays out frustratingly vague grounds for impeachment of the president and other “civil Officers of the United States”: “Treason, Bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The standard established over the years is that federal judges are impeachable only for actions taken outside the normal bounds of their role.\n\nBut Roberts also well knows that impeachment is a political tool, not a legal one. The question isn’t whether impeachment is constitutional or legal; it’s whether it would be, as the chief justice puts it, “appropriate.”\n\nThe Constitution gives the power of impeachment to the legislative branch, not the judicial branch. Article I states that the House has the “sole Power of Impeachment,” while the Senate has the “sole Power to try all Impeachments.” Unlike under the Federal Standards of Criminal Procedure that prosecutors must adhere to in court, the bar for investigating impeachable offenses and determining guilt is essentially whatever the House and the Senate says it is. And the courts have constantly upheld the idea that they can’t really step in on matters of impeachment, including against members of the bench, as those powers are given solely to Congress. In theory, there’s nothing stopping Republicans from lining up an impeachment vote on every federal judge a Democratic president has named.\n\nWhich brings us to Musk, who has endorsed an “impeachathon” event that far-right Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., plans to hold online, targeting at least 11 judges for removal. On Wednesday, he said on X that America is experiencing a “judicial coup” that requires “60 senators to impeach the judges and restore the rule of the people.” As my colleague Jordan Rubin explained, Musk is instantly wrong on several fronts here, including the threshold for removal in the Senate. It requires two-thirds of the Senate to agree, or 67 votes, which is 14 more than the GOP currently has in its caucus.\n\nThe floundering that we’re seeing because Trump hates losing is all very funny to me, personally, amid a very unfunny time.\n\nIt’s up to the House to impeach an official first, though, and there’s a math problem there, too. Republicans do control the House and need only a majority vote to impeach. But that majority is so narrow that Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has little room for error for anything to pass on a party-line vote. That didn’t stop Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who wrote on X on Tuesday that he had introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg. That makes Boasberg the fifth federal judge to have articles filed against him since Trump was inaugurated but the first with the president’s endorsement.\n\nThis situation is set to be a political headache for Johnson. The speaker already has enough on his plate, including passing a major tax cut plan and other parts of the Trump agenda. Now he also is feeling pressure from his right flank to at least consider impeaching judges, something that at best crowds the House’s schedule further and calls attention to Trump’s consistent losses in court. Johnson was in a similar position last year when dealing with the laughable attempts to impeach President Joe Biden. This year, though, Trump is on his case from the White House, not Mar-a-Lago.\n\nEven if Johnson does push through an impeachment resolution or two, those are simply analogous to a prosecutor’s filing charges in the criminal justice system. The Senate would hold the trial, and Politico reports that there is simply no appetite for that right now in the upper chamber. Yes, the Senate could conduct those trials via a specialized committee to keep the proceedings from taking up time on the floor. But a show trial behind closed doors that ends in acquittal would be doubly pointless.\n\nThe floundering that we’re seeing because Trump hates losing is all very funny to me, personally, amid a very unfunny time. Impeachment should be used to hold public officials accountable, especially those who are unelected, but it’s been shown to be toothless in cases when partisanship can come into play. In this case, what is almost always taken as a flaw in the system is ironically exactly what’s preventing impeachment from being abused to Trump’s benefit.",

        "title": "Trump's partnership with El Salvador on deportations is a power grab",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump kicked off his first presidential campaign by implying that most everyone crossing the U.S.-Mexican border was a criminal.\n\nNow he’s using 1798’s Alien Enemies Act to operationalize that idea by deporting people accused of being gang members without any due process that might allow them to challenge the claim. And he’s citing the centuries-old law as his rationale for sending those he deems gang members to one of the most brutal and notorious prisons in El Salvador and, indeed, the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIt also serves as an example of Trump using obscure legal provisions to test how far he can take his autocratic agenda to expand executive power.\n\nTrump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, turned into grotesque display via a three-minute propaganda video shared by El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, is chilling. It allows him to dehumanize and vilify migrants as \"monsters\" to justify the expense of and obsession with deporting as many of them as possible. It also serves as an example of Trump using obscure legal provisions to test how far he can take his autocratic agenda to expand executive power.\n\nUnderstand, nothing compels Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act. If he wants to deport undocumented migrants from the U.S., even adjudicated gang members, he could cite the same laws his predecessors used to detain and deport them. (He’s been citing those more commonly used laws for most deportations.)\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used to detain and deport people from the U.S. during three times in American history, and in those cases it was used against nationals from countries at war with the U.S. But the more than 200 Venezuelans whom Trump has sent to El Salvador under the auspices of that law are from a country that the U.S. is not at war with. Trump’s effort to use the law was temporarily blocked by a federal judge who ordered the administration to turn the planes around, but unsuccessfully. (The Trump administration's position is that the courts can’t review Trump’s political determinations under the act.) Bukele taunted the judge on X, “Oopsie … Too late,” and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tesla CEO Elon Musk reposted it.\n\nWhen I asked Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, what’s the point of Trump using the Alien Enemies Act, he said: “I can’t speak exactly to their arguments, because they have yet to fully articulate that rationale, but the seeming obvious argument is that Trump campaigned on the issue, and he is trying to make a spectacle.”\n\nThat spectacle is best captured by the astonishing video Bukele shared on X on Sunday celebrating his imprisonment of the people accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The video is a hard but necessary watch, showing El Salvadoran authorities roughly handling the alleged gang members, shaving their heads and sending them into prison cells — all alongside menacing-sounding synth-heavy music. Bukele said they will be imprisoned there for at least a year. The Salvadoran strongman — who has called himself the “world’s coolest dictator” — has sharply curtailed civil liberties in El Salvador and suspended constitutional rights for years under the banner of a “state of emergency” and has frequently swept innocent people into his Center for Terrorism Confinement mega prison.\n\nA CNN report about the prison described the cells as “built to hold 80 or so inmates,” and “the only furniture is tiered metal bunks, with no sheets, pillows or mattresses … an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing and a large jug for drinking water.” The men are kept in the cells 23.5 hours a day, and Bukele said in his post that they will “labor under the Zero Idleness program.”\n\nThis video is a remarkable artifact, inviting viewers to see the migrants as deserving of exploitation and brutality from a kind of international alliance of draconian carceral states.\n\nBut the premise that everyone sent to this hellish site is a gang member is dubious. “We have only the government’s word that any of these people are members of the gang,” Reichlin-Melnick said. “The government has offered no evidence to confirm gang membership. It has not offered those individuals subject to this any opportunity to argue that they are not a member of a gang, and the people that have been sent to this prison are very likely to include some individuals who have been falsely labeled a member of a gang.”\n\nFamilies of some of the people suspected to have been deported over the weekend have denied that the deportees have ties to gangs. And a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official admitted in a sworn declaration that “many of the [Tren de Aragua gang] members removed under the AEA do not have criminal records in the United States.”\n\nEven if we were to grant that many, or even all, of the people deported to El Salvador’s mega prison were gang members, Trump’s deportations would still be disturbing. Because neither the Alien Enemies Act nor peacetime immigration law permits people to be imprisoned abroad. On what authority does Trump get to decide that someone suspected of gang membership should do hard labor in a foreign prison? And what happens to them when they get there? (This prison is explicitly run on the ethos that its inmates are beyond rehabilitation.) This is effectively vigilante justice, being practiced upon the most legally vulnerable population in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act is a power grab that relies on — and further fuels — the demonization of migrants as a class of people who should not be accorded rights. It must be rejected.",

And we’re seeing this whole-of-government effort backing the world’s richest person (and Trump’s top 2024 election donor) extend to the Department of Justice as well.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi most recently emphasized her support of Musk on Thursday, when she issued a press release headlined, “Attorney General Pamela Bondi Announces Severe Charges Against Violent Tesla Arsonists.” The release didn’t name specific defendants or charges but summarized allegations against three people she said were “responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.” She said they’ll “face the full force of the law for using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations.”\n\nBondi said in the release that “the days of committing crimes without consequence have ended” and “if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”\n\nOne might object that the days of consequence-free crime haven’t so much “ended” as a new administration has new criminal justice priorities, beginning with Trump’s blanket pardoning of the Jan. 6 defendants. But each administration is entitled to its priorities within the confines of the law, and the DOJ’s latest announcement helps to solidify its policy of protecting those loyal to Trump and taking punitive action against others.\n\nOn that note, Ed Martin, the president’s pick to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the nation’s capital, has likewise pledged to bring the weight of the federal law against Musk’s opponents. And just this week, Bondi retweeted Musk’s posts about her Fox News television appearance and public statement touting law enforcement action against Tesla-related defendants.\n\nPutting aside the specifics of these cases, whatever criminal actions anyone takes against people or property shouldn’t escape prosecution based on the victim’s identity. That is, Musk’s person and property are no less legally deserving of protection than anyone else’s. But given the political incentive behind bringing these cases and any other related ones, they’ll deserve close scrutiny as they develop.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a year since the women’s NCAA Tournament national championship game eclipsed the men’s national championship game for the first time in viewership, ticket sales and hype. With the 2025 women’s tournament officially starting Friday, what have we learned about the world of women’s college basketball since Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and her LSU rival, Angel Reese, left for the WNBA?\n\nSimply put, the idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nThe idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nTo be clear, there’s a lot of doubt among television executives regarding whether this year’s women’s national championship game will reach the 19 million viewers that last year’s showdown between Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes and Kamilla Cardoso’s South Carolina Gamecocks got. It’s worth examining how the sport has done on major television networks following the departures of Clark, Reese and many of the other college players who transitioned to the pros.\n\nFor years, a catch-22 of women’s basketball has been the complaint from major networks like Fox, ABC and CBS that women’s sports doesn’t have a large enough fan base and the counter from fans that the fan base won’t grow if games aren’t televised. For so long, networks generally declined to show women’s college basketball on the most accessible television networks.\n\nHowever, as a result of the success last season, Fox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season. Fox broadcast 18 games during the 2024-25 season, including five games in prime-time Saturday night slots.\n\n“There are great stars, great brands. We’ve done more than we have done before, and we’re not alone in doing that,” Fox Sports’ president of insights and analytics, Mike Mulvihill, said.\n\nCBS broadcast this season’s Big Ten Tournament final for the second straight year. It included the third matchup of the season between Los Angeles rivals UCLA and USC, who have two superstar talents of their own. The Clark-vs.-Reese rivalry was only the beginning. I’ll come back to this.\n\nFox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season.\n\nThe Big Ten championship game drew 1.44 million viewers, and UConn vs. USC averaged 2.2 million viewers on a Fox Saturday night prime-time matchup. While there was a dip when it came to how Clark’s games did on these same networks a year before, these non-Clark games still got viewerships in the millions. That’s not nothing, and the numbers prove that viewers are drawn to other stars, too.\n\nAnd then there are ABC and ESPN. Their regular-season ratings were up 3% over last year and up 41% from the 2022-23 season. This was the most-watched women’s college basketball regular season since the season Tina Charles and Maya Moore led UConn to the national championship in 2009. There was a 120% year-over-year viewership increase in the three games televised on ABC, which averaged 1.3 million viewers a game.\n\nViewership of around 1 million people across multiple networks disproves the prediction that the women’s college game wouldn’t stay afloat after Clark and Reese left. Another sign the game is doing just fine: The average price for a 30-second commercial during this year’s women’s national championship game has more than doubled.\n\nA big reason an equal number of people, if not more, have watched women’s college basketball the season after Clark, Reese and Cardoso left is the wide array of talent teams have put on the court all season. According to ESPN Bet, there are six teams with better than 10-to-1 odds to win the national championship. Parity has been the name of the game this season.\n\nEach of those six teams has at least one generational talent who’s bound to have a successful WNBA career. Let’s begin with USC’s JuJu Watkins, a 6-2 two-way small forward who is a prolific scorer and gifted athlete. Watkins has played the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed, UCLA, and point center Lauren Betts three times and beaten them twice.\n\nBut both L.A. schools are on the same side of the bracket as UConn, which has Paige Bueckers, the 2021 National Player of the Year, who is playing in her final NCAA Tournament. With shooting guard Azzi Fudd and big wing Sarah Strong, Bueckers has more talent around her than she’s had in her entire UConn career.\n\nReese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nWe can’t forget about Notre Dame, which has a three-headed monster in its backcourt: flashy pass-first guard Olivia Miles, defense-minded slashing guard Hannah Hidalgo and do-it-all wing Sonia Citron. But to win the championship, the Fighting Irish will have to get through Texas, led by three-level scoring point forward Madison Booker, and the defending champions, the South Carolina Gamecocks, who are arguably the deepest team in the field.\n\nThe Gamecocks don’t have a true No. 1 option, but March Madness is when superstars are born. Does speedy and shifty guard MiLaysia Fulwiley emerge as South Carolina’s unstoppable force? We’ll have to see.\n\nPeople don’t have to know that Clark is playing to watch women play basketball. The new 3-on-3 professional league Unrivaled aggressively pursued her to play in its inaugural season. She decided against it. Still, 364,000 viewers (the second most who’d ever watched an Unrivaled game), watched the first-ever championship game. Other WNBA stars, including Reese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nIn the same way, Watkins, Bueckers, Hidalgo, Miles, Booker and Fulwiley will keep March Madness humming following the departure of Clark. The women’s basketball boom was never about one player, and now we have the numbers that prove it.",

        "content": "I grew up in middle-class America as the daughter of a teacher and a school psychologist, that is to parents who were lucky to receive a reasonable salary and excellent insurance and retirement benefits throughout their careers. They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat’s why I never knew that my parents weren’t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren’t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family’s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad’s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn’t. But given the speed of Mom’s memory decline and the severity of Dad’s chronic illnesses, they couldn’t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what’s called “independent living” for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing — a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn’t know about nursing homes. I didn’t realize, for example, that my parents’ “good” private insurance didn’t cover nursing home care. But that’s fine, I thought; Dad’s old enough for Medicare. That’s when I learned Medicare doesn’t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his “life community,” I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn’t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom’s assisted living. To pay for Dad’s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn’t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn’t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids’ college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn’t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That’s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father’s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I’d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they’ll need Medicaid — until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt’s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move.",

        "content": "UPDATE (March 20, 2025, 5:14 p.m. ET): A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled Thursday that Badar Khan Suri “shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.”\n\nFederal immigration authorities are seeking to deport a Georgetown University graduate student from India, accusing him of spreading Hamas propaganda online and of harboring ties to the U.S.-designated terror group.\n\nBadar Khan Suri, who is in the U.S. on a student visa, was arrested Monday night outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, by agents who said they were with the Department of Homeland Security, his lawyer Hassan Ahmad told NBC News.\n\nAhmad has filed a habeas petition on Suri’s behalf seeking his release from a Louisiana detention facility, where he is currently being held.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, claimed in a post on X that Suri was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,” and that he “has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”\n\nThe department has not presented details about its allegations against Suri or evidence that he committed any crime, his lawyer said in the petition. Suri has not been charged and has no criminal record, according to Ahmad.\n\nGeorgetown has said that it is not aware of any illegal activity on Suri’s part and that it has not been informed of a reason for his detention.\n\nMcLaughlin said Secretary of State Marco Rubio deemed Suri “deportable” under the same provision that the administration has invoked in its attempt to remove Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. permanent resident, from the country.\n\nAccording to Politico, which first reported Suri’s arrest, Ahmad argued in the petition that Suri is being punished because his wife, a U.S. citizen, is of Palestinian heritage, and because the administration suspects them of opposing U.S. foreign policy toward Israel. The petition also states that Suri’s wife previously worked for Al Jazeera and has been accused of having “ties with Hamas.” (Politico obtained a physical copy of the petition, which is not publicly available and has not been reviewed by MSNBC or NBC News.)\n\nAhmad told The New York Times that although he is still looking into the case, he believed the accusations are connected to Suri’s father-in-law, who the Times reported is a former adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ late political chief. Suri’s father-in-law, who lives in Gaza, told the Times that he left his position in the Hamas government more than a decade ago. He also told the Times that Suri is not involved in any political activism, including on Hamas’ behalf.\n\nAccording to his profile on the university’s website, Suri is a postdoctoral fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. He has a doctorate in peace and conflict studies from the Nelson Mandela Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to detain and deport a number of noncitizens, characterizing them as Hamas sympathizers for their public opposition to Israel’s military assault on Gaza and United States’ support for Israel. Civil rights advocates have said the administration is targeting legal immigrants based on their political views, in violation of their First Amendment rights.",

        "title": "Trump issues executive order seeking to abolish Education Department",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As a presidential candidate in 2024, Donald Trump never came up with a detailed plan related to education policy, but the Republican did make one thing explicitly clear: He wanted to shut down the Education Department if given a second term.\n\nIn September 2023, for example, he released a video, which was posted to social media, in which he vowed to scrap the Cabinet agency “very early in the administration.” He added in March 2024, “It’s time. Close it up.”\n\nAs the president’s second term gets underway, he’s apparently following through on this — or at least taking steps in that direction. On Thursday afternoon, the president did, in fact, sign an executive order designed to start the process of closing the department. NBC News reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start dismantling the Department of Education. “It sounds strange, doesn’t it? Department of Education. We’re going to eliminate it,” Trump said while speaking in the East Room of the White House at a ceremony where he was flanked by children seated at school desks.\n\nThe order will not literally shutter the agency — a step that would require an act of Congress. Rather, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the Education Department will still perform its “critical functions,” including oversight of student loans.\n\nThe executive order, in other words, will start the dismantling process, but it will not permanently and completely close the department’s doors.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Education Secretary Linda McMahon sending an email to her agency’s staff. The title on the message read, “Our Department’s Final Mission.”\n\nSubtle, it was not. A few days later, McMahon was asked on Fox News whether the country needs her department. “No,” she replied, “we don’t.”\n\nThere’s ample evidence to the contrary. At the federal level, the Education Department is responsible for everything from overseeing a massive federal student loan program to administering grants, from collecting key data used in policymaking to enforcing civil rights laws.\n\nMcMahon, incidentally, will get a different job, Trump announced at the signing event.\n\nThere is no great public appetite for such a dramatic change. In fact, publicly available polling has long suggested the American public is broadly against scrapping the Education Department. In fact, a recent Washington Post analysis noted that while there hasn’t been a lot of recent public opinion research on the issue, “virtually all of the polling ... suggests this is not what the American people want. Indeed, it appears to be among the more unpopular things Trump has pushed for.”\n\nEvidently, the White House is moving forward with its plans anyway, executing a plan that, like so much of Trump's agenda, was part of the right-wing Project 2025 blueprint.",

        "content": "UPDATE (March 20, 2025; 4:42 p.m. ET): On Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg called the federal government’s latest response to his inquiries “woefully insufficient.” He ordered the government to provide additional information in the coming days, starting with a sworn declaration due Friday at 10:00 a.m. from someone with direct involvement in Cabinet-level discussions regarding the invocation of the state secrets privilege.\n\nA federal judge still has questions about the Trump administration’s compliance with his orders, and the administration is still trying not to answer them.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg gave the government another day to get back to him on the matter. But his latest order suggests he isn’t pleased — or persuaded — by the government’s arguments thus far regarding its deportation flights over the weekend and its litigation conduct since then.\n\nFollowing a hearing Monday at which the government didn’t want to answer Boasberg’s questions, the judge issued an order requiring officials to submit a sealed declaration answering outstanding questions about Saturday’s deportations, which the judge had ordered halted while litigation continues over President Donald Trump’s authority under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThose answers were most recently due by noon Wednesday, but ahead of that deadline, the government asked Boasberg for more time. The request noted that the Justice Department is appealing his orders and said addressing his questions “would undermine the Executive Branch’s ability to negotiate with foreign sovereigns in the future by subjecting all of the arrangements resulting from any such negotiations — as well as the negotiations themselves — to a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.” The government also said it’s evaluating whether to invoke the state secrets privilege regarding information sought by the judge.\n\nIn his latest order on Wednesday, Boasberg wrote that he wasn’t seeking information for a “fishing expedition” but rather “to determine if the Government deliberately flouted” his orders and “if so, what the consequences should be.”\n\nBoasberg expressed doubt about whether the government could successfully keep information under wraps on state secrets grounds, noting that it “appears to be an uncommon occurrence for the disclosure of unclassified information to threaten state secrets.” The judge questioned the purported danger raised by the government about giving him that information in private, observing that the government itself has publicly promoted details of the flights.\n\nAnd the fact that officials are appealing his temporary restraining orders doesn’t affect the judge’s interest in finding out whether the government violated them. He wrote that he’s seeking information “to determine whether the Government complied with the TROs. Whether those TROs were legally defective or legally sound does not govern the compliance inquiry.”\n\nThe most recent order followed Trump’s call for Boasberg’s impeachment and a rare public statement from Chief Justice John Roberts that reiterated that the proper way to respond to an adverse ruling is to appeal it, not to try to impeach the judge. Boasberg seemed to acknowledge that broader issue in his order Wednesday, writing: “As the Supreme Court has made crystal clear, the proper recourse for a party subject to an injunction it believes is legally flawed — and is indeed later shown to be so flawed — is appellate review, not disobedience.”\n\nWhether Boasberg becomes officially convinced that such disobedience has occurred in this case remains to be seen. The administration has a new deadline of noon Thursday to answer his questions or to invoke the state secrets doctrine. Boasberg has already expressed skepticism of how the latter might apply, but even if a state secrets argument is unsuccessful, it could buy the government more time, to the extent that delay is part of its litigation strategy. If instead it attempts to answer his questions, we should learn whether the judge finds those answers satisfactory — and if not, what the “consequences” of such a finding will be.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "There’s a 12 p.m. ET deadline Thursday for the Trump administration to answer U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s questions about whether officials violated his orders on deportations. But while that crucial issue is pending, there’s also the underlying litigation about what started the class action lawsuit in the first place: President Donald Trump’s attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act to summarily remove people from the country who the government said belong to the gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nAs a reminder, the 1798 act says:\n\nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.\n\nYou’ll notice the reference to a “declared war” or “invasion or predatory incursion” by a foreign nation or government.\n\nSo how, you might wonder, could the act apply if we’re talking about a gang, rather than a nation or government?\n\nTrump’s proclamation said the group is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization whose members “have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.” But however persuasive or not it is to apply the 18th-century law in this situation, his administration has argued that courts lack the power to review or enjoin his proclamation.\n\nIn their latest court filing, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who brought the suit called the implications of Trump’s position “staggering.” The plaintiffs wrote: “If the President can label any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.” They noted that the act has been invoked three times before — all during declared wars.\n\nTheir filing comes in opposition to the government’s motion to vacate Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders halting deportations under the act (the same orders that officials may have violated, which is what Boasberg still has questions about). Opposing that motion, plaintiffs say part of the problem is that the government is simply claiming that the people Trump wants deported are dangerous gang members engaged in an invasion or predatory incursion but without giving them the chance to contest that claim.\n\n“Notably, some Plaintiffs’ asylum claims assert the real fear of harm upon returning even to Venezuela because they fled the very same violent gangs the Government has wrongfully accused them of belonging to,” they wrote to Boasberg, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C. They pointed out that keeping his orders in place wouldn’t mean that people can’t be detained or deported at all, just that Trump wouldn’t be able to use this wartime authority for that purpose here.\n\nWhile the government seeks to convince Boasberg to upend his orders, officials are also trying to get the Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court to halt them, with an appellate hearing set for Monday. The government has even asked the appeals court to kick Boasberg off the case, while Trump has called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nBut in addition to the pending question of whether Boasberg thinks officials have violated his orders — and the important follow-up question of what he’d do about it, if so — there are the “staggering,” to use the plaintiffs’ word, implications of the government’s position overall. The courts therefore have an equally important task of sorting out both the merits of this issue and the government’s compliance with court orders during this litigation.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Over the past several days, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to quell fury within his party over his leadership, stemming largely — but not completely — from his recent support for a Republican-devised spending bill that will impose deep spending cuts to critical federal programs.\n\nSchumer’s appearance Tuesday on “All In with Chris Hayes” proved his critics are right to voice concerns about whether he's up to the challenge of facing off against President Donald Trump's illiberal administration and its allies in Congress.\n\nAfter Hayes showed a supercut of Democrats criticizing Schumer's vote in favor of the bill, the senator insisted that a government shutdown — which would have happened had the spending bill not passed by last Friday's deadline — would give the executive branch maximum power to control and cut federal programs.\n\n“If you don’t have a shutdown, you can go to court,” Schumer said at one point, nodding to one of the few tools Democrats have used to take on the Trump administration’s aggressive cuts. Schumer told Hayes a shutdown would mean giving Republicans “the keys to the city.” Hayes, however, argued a shutdown could have been used as leverage and an opportunity to make Americans understand the seriousness of the Trump administration’s lawlessness.\n\nIt was fair for Schumer to argue, as he did, that he made a tough decision. The problem is that his job isn’t merely to make tough decisions, even if those decisions are the correct ones (and I’m not certain this one was). As the leader of Senate Democrats, his job is arguably to devise and unify his party — and fundamentally, voters who empowered them — around a substantive plan to push back against Trump, amid widespread concerns about Trump’s imposition of what Hayes has rightly called an “American dictatorship.”\n\nAnd Schumer fell short on that front. In the most revealing exchange of the night, he told Hayes he didn’t think the United States is currently in a constitutional crisis, but that we’re “getting there” and that Trump defying a Supreme Court ruling would truly amount to such a crisis.\n\nPolling has shown Democratic Party voters overwhelmingly want leaders in their party to fight harder against Trump’s administration, but Schumer’s claim suggested he doesn’t share their urgency.\n\nIt’s a point Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive activist group Indivisible, made during an interview on \"All In\" immediately following Schumer's appearance.\n\n\"Now that I understand Schumer doesn’t believe we’re yet in a constitutional crisis, his tactical shortcomings make sense,\" Levin told Hayes. \"But his position here is also deeply out of line with rank and file Dems. We need new leadership.\"\n\nOn social media, various liberal activists and commentators let out what was essentially a collective groan over the Schumer interview. The Senate Democratic leader’s support from his party’s base was already unstable. Tuesday’s interview was revelatory — and did little to alleviate concerns from some of his party members.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, Suzanne Collins added another book to her literary pantheon, a prequel to “The Hunger Games” called “Sunrise on the Reaping.” Nearly two decades after the original trilogy was published, “Sunrise on the Reaping” proves how critical and timely the series remains.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” reads like it is aware of its impact and its audience. Collins’ writing is as lyrical and engrossing as it was when “The Hunger Games” debuted 17 years ago; the difference is this new book is born into an already existing cultural dominion. Collins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\nCollins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” centers on Haymitch Abernathy, a complex and misunderstood alcoholic who appears in the original trilogy as Katniss Everdeen’s initially begrudging and then devoted coach and mentor. Collins capitalizes on the familiarity most readers will have with Haymitch’s character to craft a story that deftly examines the power of propaganda and the early stages of authoritarian rule.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” is Collins’ second prequel. The first, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” chronicles President Coriolanus Snow’s journey to becoming the fascist leader of Panem, Collins’ dystopian reimagining of North America. Read together, the two novels illustrate how fascism takes shape: You need the right person and the right environment.\n\nThere are certain elements, structurally and stylistically, that all five books share. Collins breaks her novels into three equal parts, with the same number of chapters. In a rare interview this week with Scholastic’s David Levithan, Collins explained, “I began as a playwright over forty years ago, and that dramatic structure became the template for the novels. … I know certain things I want to achieve by certain points in the story. If I haven’t achieved them, something isn’t working the way I hoped, and I probably need to pause and figure out why.”\n\nStylistically, “The Hunger Games” series makes its reader culpable in the grotesque deaths of tributes, of children. Collins masterfully writes these scenes to be fast-paced, engrossing and detailed. You like reading them. You enjoy the horrifying brutality of the Hunger Games. In this way, the reader is complicit — just as complicit as the series’ wealthy citizens of The Capitol, who watch from safe perches in colorful outfits. Collins also grounds the novel with numerous literary references: Haymitch remembers a William Blake poem, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” is repeated again and again, we have a character named for Emperor Caligula’s horse, and the book opens with four quotes including a reflection from George Orwell.\n\nCollins has a knack for eliciting emotion. Readers across the country posted photos of their tear-streaked faces and puffy eyes on social media after finishing “Sunrise on the Reaping.”\n\nIn 17 years, Collins has created a brutal, grisly and heart-wrenching world that has gripped a generation of readers. Like Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon, an adjective — this is very Hunger Games — used to illustrate government overreach and authoritarianism. “The Hunger Games” series, including “Sunrise on the Reaping,” is a central part in the American dystopian literary canon. Dystopian literature doesn’t look like any one overarching government, environmental catastrophe or mechanism for control. What it all shares is a worst-case-scenario examination that is thought-provoking and engrossing, especially for young readers.\n\nLike Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon.\n\nYoung adult dystopian novels are hugely popular. The runaway success of “The Hunger Games,” with a megahit movie franchise and more than 100 million copies in print, proves that. At a recent meeting of MSNBC’s the Velshi Banned Book Club, Lois Lowry, author of one of the first young adult dystopian novels to captivate the nation, “The Giver,” attributes the success of the genre — and its widespread bans and removals — to the young protagonists. In the pages of these books, it is the young hero, the underdog, who enacts societal change. “A young person has perceived the hypocrisy and corruption of the governance of the generation that has created their world,” Lowry said.\n\nThe propaganda commentary at the center of “Sunrise on the Reaping” reminded me of early August when Elon Musk reposted a popular meme that regularly circulates online: “You watched ‘The Hunger Games’ and sided with the resistance. … When it’s fiction you understand. Yet you refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in. Wild.” Seventy-four million people viewed the post. Many of them reacted negatively, calling Musk, and his wealth and influence, The Capitol. This isn’t the only time men of undue and dangerous influence have twisted Collins’ story in and attempt to use it for their own benefit. If nothing else, it proves the power of literature, particularly this genre of literature, to influence and inspire. In the brutal world of Panem, the narrative must be controlled. And off the page? The narrative must be distorted.",

        "title": "Trump’s FTC firings underscore his commitment to big businesses and billionaires",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump attempted to fire the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission, even though he can only fire the congressionally-appointed commissioners for cause. It marks a very sudden end — at least for now — to the agency’s efforts to enforce antitrust laws and consumer protections. And it’s another sign Donald Trump is governing not on behalf of the people but for the benefit of America’s biggest and most powerful businesses and billionaires. Furthermore, if the courts uphold this action — a big if — it will endanger the independence of every government agency that is designed to be insulated from day-to-day political White House pressures.\n\nWhy Trump decided to do this is a mystery. The FTC has five members, three from the president’s political party and two from the opposition. It’s not as though the two jettisoned commissioners controlled the FTC — they represented the minority Democratic Party. Earlier this week, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson defended the structure of the FTC on the Bloomberg podcast Odd Lots: “If you have an agency that is exceeding the law, abusing the companies that it purports to regulate, it’s helpful for markets, for courts, for litigants, for government transparency to have people in the other party pointing this out.”\n\nThis is corruption, plain and simple.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya\n\nOf course, that’s almost certainly the point of ditching the two commissioners. For decades, antitrust law was ignored and dismissed by administrations from both parties and even by those who were charged with enforcing those laws. Biden-era FTC Chair Lina Khan reinvigorated and restored antitrust law (and was reviled by billionaires and many on Wall Street as a result). Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic commissioners Trump wants to deep-six, are committed to her vision.\n\nUnder Khan, the FTC sued Amazon in two separate civil suits, alleging, among other things, that the company is using monopoly power over the smaller businesses that sell through their site to raise prices across the internet. The two commissioners are responsible for enforcing a privacy consent decree against X. At the same time, agency staff began strengthening internet privacy rules — something that affects platforms like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. They were also in the early stages of attempting to bring America’s soaring pharmaceutical prices under control. And the agency is suing the country’s three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), alleging they colluded to increase the price of insulin.\n\nAll of these FTC actions are presumably in deep jeopardy as the remaining Republican commissioners’ commitment to this agenda is tenuous at best. Trump campaigned on cracking down on PBMs, bringing down the cost of living and corralling Big Tech. These are all of huge importance to the Democratic commissioners, yet the White House claimed in their note to Bedoya and Slaughter, “Your continued service on the F.T.C. is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.”\n\nIt’s hard to see how — unless that is, you view it in the greater context of Big Tech and Big Business warmly embracing Trump. X owner Elon Musk donated more than $250 million to get him elected, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave generously to his inauguration committee, and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos bought the rights to a Melania Trump documentary and purchased streaming rights to all 15 seasons of \"The Apprentice,\" pouring millions upon millions of dollars directly into the Trump family coffers. All have been rewarded with White House access and, in Musk’s case, the opportunity to slash the federal government bureaucracy and fire government workers at a whim.\n\n“This is corruption, plain and simple,” Bedoya said on a Tuesday night press call. “Who does this attempt to remove us help? Because it doesn’t help regular people trying to, struggling to pay the bills and struggling to pay the rent. Who it helps is billionaires, and I think it opens the door for corruption, and for a law enforcement apparatus that is controlled not by the law, but by money.”\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad.\n\nBut there’s something else possibly happening here, too. Almost a century ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire a Republican-appointed member of the FTC. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a president can only fire congressionally appointed agency heads for cause. Disagreement isn’t good enough. Trump’s actions are not only illegal and unlawful, but they threaten other government agencies — including, crucially from Wall Street’s perspective, the Federal Reserve. If the Supreme Court rules that Trump can jettison the FTC commissioners — yes, this is heading to court — who's to say he’ll stop there? “If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired,” Slaughter said Tuesday on CNBC.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad. The politicization of regulation and policy is, by definition, destabilizing to the greater economy. Decisions that appear to be made for the benefit of favored oligarchs do not make for a healthy business environment, which demands a fair application of the rule of law. It enables a corrupt economy, where money and power flow to the very top, and the rest of us, individuals and smaller honest businesses alike, are seen as so much prey. This is what Khan, Bedoya and Slaughter attempted to stop and put in reverse.\n\nOligarchs — from either party — who are used to operating without checks on their power never want cops on the beat. We saw it during the presidential election when billionaire supporters of Kamala Harris tried to bully her into committing to ditching Khan if she won, and we saw it again earlier this year when the Trump administration attempted to destroy the Consumer Federation Protection Bureau. Now, it’s playing out at the FTC, where the Trump administration is willing to break the law to get the white-collar cops to stand down.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, some eligible New Hampshire voters experienced significant roadblocks to participating in the state’s first elections since it enacted a law that requires a birth certificate, passport, or other proof of citizenship to register to vote. The mess provided a preview of the steep hurdles prospective voters across the country will face if Congress passes the SAVE Act, a bill that will imperil Americans’ ability to participate in elections.\n\nFor one voter in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, satisfying the state’s new requirements was like a bad visit to the DMV. Betsy Spencer, 70, told New Hampshire Public Radio that it took multiple attempts over several hours with different documents proving her citizenship to re-register to vote on Election Day (New Hampshire is one of 23 states that allows same-day voter registration). Among other problems, her birth certificate didn’t match her married name. Spencer wasn’t the only one to experience difficulties: other voters who needed to register reported being turned away because they didn’t bring a birth certificate, passport, or other proof of citizenship with them to the polls. While some returned with the required proof to vote, others did not.\n\nThis would effectively end mail registration, online registration, and voter registration drives.\n\nIf the SAVE Act becomes law, voters nationwide will face similar problems to those in New Hampshire, if not worse. Like the New Hampshire law, the federal SAVE Act would require voters to show a document like a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers in person to an election official to register to vote. But the federal version would be even stricter than the New Hampshire law. Our research shows that at least 21 million American citizens don’t have ready access to those documents. The SAVE Act’s show-your-papers requirement would block millions of American citizens from voting, and it would be especially burdensome for young Americans and Americans of color.\n\nThe bill could also jeopardize voting access for tens of millions of married women who have changed their last names. Roughly 80 percent of American women in opposite-sex marriages took their husband’s last name, according to a 2023 Pew study. Yet the bill doesn’t address what happens when a person’s legal name is different than the name on their birth certificate or passport.\n\nThe SAVE Act’s damage would extend beyond the millions of American citizens who don’t have ready access to citizenship documents. Eligible voters would be required to present their citizenship documentation in person to an election official both when they register the first time and anytime they need to re-register.\n\nThis would effectively end mail registration, online registration, and voter registration drives — all extremely popular and convenient methods American voters rely on. Between 2018 and 2022, these three ways to register accounted for about one in every three registrations nationally, according to the Election Administration and Voting Survey. In the two years before the 2020 presidential election alone, more than 37 million people either registered for the first time or updated their registration using one of these methods, the survey found.\n\nThe reality is that federal and state laws are already in place to ensure that only eligible U.S. citizens vote, and carry steep penalties for those who violate them. Yet, the House is currently expected to take up the bill during the week of March 31.\n\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law to eradicate racial discrimination in voting and expand access to the ballot box for people of color. If Congress were to enact the SAVE Act, it would be an unprecedented departure from its longstanding commitment to protecting the freedom to vote. Congress should not turn its back on this duty. The SAVE Act is a voter suppression bill. It would keep many millions of eligible American citizens on the sidelines of our democracy. It must never become law.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A newly unearthed memo from the Trump administration calls to mind the infamous words of the late segregationist and Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who said at his inauguration in 1963, “I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever.” Now the message of a recent Trump administration memo seems to be “segregation again.”\n\nNPR reports that a memo issued by the administration in February omits federal guidelines that prevent contractors from receiving federal funds if they operate segregated facilities.\n\nPer the report:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination.\n\nThe disappearance of the language doesn’t alter the fact that federal law, including the Civil Rights Act, and some state laws still ban segregation and other forms of discrimination in all businesses. MSNBC contributor Melissa Murray told NPR the move was “meaningful in its symbolism” because these provisions “were all part of the federal government’s efforts to facilitate the settlement that led to integration in the 1950s and 1960s.”\n\nStudies have shown that racial segregation persists in various aspects of life, including housing and education, despite federal and state laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Kirk, a far-right influencer and close Trump ally, has argued the Civil Rights Act was a “mistake.” And the person Trump has nominated to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, far-right lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, doesn’t inspire confidence that the administration will prioritize cases involving claims of segregation.\n\nBut the symbolism of the administration’s retracting its prohibition on contractors’ operating segregated facilities is also a message: When the government explicitly says it won’t do business with segregationists, that discourages segregation. When it doesn’t explicitly say that, it provides a permission structure for segregation to occur.\n\nWith his tariffs, Trump is threatening to drag the U.S. back into the disastrous economic policies of the 1890s. This retraction of anti-segregation guidelines adds to a heaping pile of evidence that he’s looking to replicate that era’s social policies, too.",

        "content": "With several of President Donald Trump’s policies now making their way through the legal system, judges who have ruled against the administration are facing increased threats of violence and impeachment.\n\nSeveral judges have raised alarm about the rise in threats that they and their colleagues have received, warning that it is a long-term trend across presidential administrations.\n\nBut Trump and his allies’ recent attacks on the judiciary are likely exacerbating the problem.\n\nAccording to an investigation of several online social platforms by the nonprofit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, calls for impeachment and violence rose 54% in February from the previous month, with some commenters using slurs against certain judges and others calling for them to be executed over their court decisions.\n\nThose threats, the group said, are “inspired in part by attacks on judges by President Trump, his close allies, including Elon Musk, and some in the GOP.”\n\nTrump has been incredibly vocal about his disdain for judges who have made rulings unfavorable to his administration. He has gone so far as to call for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered the White House to halt its haphazard effort to deport Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTrump’s attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but the president’s allies have nevertheless piled on.\n\nTrump’s attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but the president’s allies have nevertheless piled on. GOP members of Congress who expressed support for impeaching judges who rule against the administration have also reportedly received a boost in donations from Musk, Trump’s billionaire ally, who on Wednesday baselessly accused those judges of “extreme abuse of the legal system.”\n\nSome of those threats have made their way offline. The New York Times reported that judges have received bomb threats, swatting calls and even anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes as a veiled intimidation tactic.\n\nJudges’ family members have also been targeted. Earlier this month, the sister of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett — who has come under fire from MAGA supporters over her recent rulings against the administration — was the target of a pipe bomb threat at her home, according to police in Charleston, South Carolina. The threat was determined to be a false alarm, police said.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s team is effective at using fiery rhetoric, which often includes lies, to paint his opponents as villains and to manufacture crises they insist only he can solve. Take the current fracas over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants whose alleged gang ties led Trump to declare them terrorists.\n\nThe debate reached fever pitch Wednesday, when Attorney General Pam Bondi, in an appearance on Fox News, launched an incendiary attack on so-called liberal U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of \"meddling in our government.\" Bondi said, \"And the question should be, why is the judge trying to protect terrorists who invaded our country over American citizens?”\n\nThat’s quite the statement. Rather, it's empty rhetoric not supported by facts.\n\nWhoa, nelly. That’s quite the statement. Rather, it's empty rhetoric not supported by facts.\n\nWhat’s especially pernicious is Bondi’s arrogant use of “our government” — as if the federal judiciary is not a co-equal branch of government. There’s an old-fashioned, but still appropriate idea that the public is best served when the Department of Justice speaks through its court filings. It’s also outrageous for Bondi to launch a verbal assault against a federal judge amidst an increased wave of violent threats.\n\nNone of this is normal.\n\nBut this is how Bondi rolls. In less than two months, the attorney general, who’s sworn to protect and defend all of us, has gained a reputation for just offering red meat to MAGA conservatives, whether lying about crime rates or mocking Hunter Biden at partisan political conferences or shattering norms by appearing exclusively on one conservative TV network every week of her tenure. She first proved herself in 2020, embracing Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She even travelled to Pennsylvania and made claims of “evidence of cheating” and “fake ballots” that didn’t exist.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Bondi the MAGA warrior would viciously attack Boasberg, a nonpartisan judge who was appointed to a seat on the D.C. Superior Court by Republican President George W. Bush. When President Barack Obama nominated him for a federal judgeship a decade later, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him.\n\nJudge Boasberg is neither a knee-jerk liberal nor a died-in-the-wool conservative. He has issued rulings that Trump supported, such as when he ordered the FBI to release thousands of emails belonging to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and he has issued rulings that Trump opposed, such as cleared the way for former Vice President Mike Pence to provide grand jury testimony in DOJ’s investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. In law school, “this Democrat activist,” as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrongly labeled him this week, roomed with now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who presided over his investiture.\n\nContrary to Bondi’s incendiary rhetoric that Judge Boasberg has “no right to ask those questions,” the truth is he has the right and is right to ask hard questions of the president’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. The law was last used following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II to relocate and incarcerate thousands of people of Japanese ancestry in the U.S. The Trump administration has provided no proof — to the court or anybody else — that the individuals detained and deported are in fact violent gang members in the country illegally. They’re telling the court and the public, but not showing us the proof, as MSNBC’s Ali Vitali observed.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why Judge Boasberg would have some questions, given the Trump administration’s “shoot first, ask questions later” sloppy approach to government. Like when they mistakenly declared a Seattle man dead and stopped his Social Security benefits; or abruptly fired (and then rehired) hundreds highly trained federal employees working on the nation’s nuclear weapons programs. Or inadvertently released Social Security numbers and other private information of former congressional staff. The list of things they should be questioned about is long.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why Judge Boasberg would have questions, given the Trump administration’s sloppy approach to government.\n\nBut none of this matters to the Trump administration, which senses a political opening. And on the underlying question — the removal of any violent undocumented immigrant from the country — he has the support of most Americans, including Democrats. In fact, immigration/border security is the only major issue in which the majority of Americans approve of how Trump is handling it, according NBC News polling. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of the issue, while 43% disapprove. A clear majority, 56%, say he’s bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue.\n\nBut even policies that the American people approve of must be carried out according to the law, and, as Judge Boasberg is working to determine if applicable laws were followed, Trump and his administration are sowing discord for his political benefit.\n\nAnd Bondi’s part in sowing that discord includes her characterizing as an offense the sacred obligation that a judge, and indeed every member of a co-equal branch government, has to ensure that we all live up to our constitutional responsibilities.",

        "title": "What John Roberts' statement could mean for Trump's SCOTUS appeals",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the federal judge adjudicating a challenge to recent deportation orders a “Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator” and called for his impeachment. In response to this and other, similar attacks on judges, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took the extraordinary step of issuing a public statement condemning such attacks.\n\nAs the chief justice explained in his statement, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nThis could be a signal that Roberts might not be willing to rule with the Trump administration when it comes to its many forays into seemingly unconstitutional territory. And not a moment too soon.\n\nLike most chief justices who have preceded him, Roberts tends to let his judicial opinions deliver his messages. This time, as the Trump administration’s attacks on the courts are growing, we face the likelihood of seeing federal officials defy court orders in the very near future (if they haven’t done so already). That’s why the chief justice’s statements couldn’t come at a better (or more perilous) time for the rule of law, which seems constantly under threat.\n\nFederal judges, like many other federal officials, are subject to removal from their otherwise lifetime appointments through impeachment. Removal of federal judges through impeachment is very rare, however. It has happened only five times over the last 100 years and typically for things like outright corruption. The purpose behind the lifetime appointment of federal judges and the high bar of impeachment is, as Alexander Hamilton explained, to insulate judges from the political winds and outside pressure.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton argued in Federalist 78 that not just independence, but also “complete independence of the courts” was “peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution,” one in which other branches were constrained by the Constitution and the courts had to help enforce those constraints.\n\nThe recent attacks on judges fly in the face of this “complete independence.”\n\nSince the start of Trump’s second administration, calls for impeachment have emanated from members of Congress, Elon Musk and now from the president himself. What is more, we seem to be headed for a significant constitutional crisis over whether the Trump administration is willing to defy court orders.\n\nThis could be a signal that Roberts might not be willing to rule with the Trump administration when it comes to its many forays into seemingly unconstitutional territory.\n\nAlmost at the same time that the chief justice was issuing his statement, in a courthouse down the street, lawyers for the federal government were trying to defend the actions of the administration over the weekend, when it seemed they might have ignored a direct order of another judge, this one from James Boasberg, the chief judge of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This is the same judge Trump called a “radical left lunatic,” who just happened to have been confirmed by the Senate in a 96-0 vote in 2011.\n\nIn that case, Judge Boasberg had directed the government to stop its deportation of hundreds of migrants without due process of law, including directing the government to turn any planes around that might contain such migrants and might have already taken off.\n\nDespite some defiant statements over the last few days that the court had no power to issue such orders or that the government didn’t have to obey them, lawyers were in court Tuesday afternoon trying to explain that the actions of the federal government weren’t actually in contravention of the court’s order. Their position in court has been very different from the bold statements from several Trump officials, made to the media, that the administration could simply flout the court’s directives.\n\nWhile it is obviously critical for the chief justice to speak up against unconscionable attacks on judges because they might disagree with the Trump administration over the law — which is all that the judges who have been attacked so far have done — the Roberts defense could signal that he may serve as a bulwark on the court against the more extreme positions of the Trump administration more generally and the arguments raised by its lawyers.\n\nWhen an emergency application came before the Supreme Court over cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, at first Roberts issued an administrative stay of a lower court order to give the entire court a chance to consider the Trump administration’s request to enable it to continue to devastate this agency. That gave some court watchers pause, and many expressed concerns that the Trump administration would be unleashed to take action against not just USAID but also other government agencies.\n\nSeveral days later, though, the entire court ruled, with Roberts in the majority (with Justice Amy Coney Barrett and the three liberal justices), to allow the lower court’s order protecting USAID to take effect once again.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in 2005, Roberts famously said his job was to “call balls and strikes,” like an umpire in a baseball game, and not to set the strike zone. Perhaps he realizes now that he has to do more than sit by impassively passing judgment, however. Perhaps he is starting to understand that without a sustained, vocal and affirmative defense of the judiciary, he might find that there might be little left to adjudicate in the event the branch whose job it is to “say what the law is,” as former Chief Justice John Marshall once said, finds itself hobbled and silenced by such overt threats to the rule of law.",

He also said, when pressed, that the visa holders would be \"properly vetted\" but seemingly started to add a caveat. \"You know, when you're talking about a lot of people — I think it's gonna be very successful.\"\n\nTrump has proposed the gold visas as a juiced-up replacement of the EB-5 visa, which already exists to allow foreign investors to obtain a green card if they invest at least $1.05 million in the U.S. Other countries with similar \"golden passports\" include Austria, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe proposal came even as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, targeted legal immigrants for deportation and contracted with El Salvador to send some deportees to a notorious prison complex.\n\nIn the interview, Ingraham also asked Trump why U.S. citizenship should be on sale \"for any amount of money\" and how it fit with his \"America First\" philosophy. Trump responded that he proposed the idea because he’s “America First,” claiming without evidence that the policy might even bring as many as 1 million new immigrants.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, Rotimi Adeoye laid out the moral and ethical objections to the proposal:\n\nIn Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with “golden visa” programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nCritics have been outspoken in laying out their worries about this golden visa plan. But the Fox News interview shows that even Trump is concerned that the new visas could be abused and he has no real plan to stop that.",

On the podcast, Rogan promoted a variation of the racist and antisemitic “replacement theory” while discussing immigration and defended Cooper from allegations of Nazi apologism, saying his work is “very valuable to me, and it’s very valuable to human beings that want to hear this nuanced, comprehensive perspective on these conflicts.”\n\nThe AngryWhiteMen blog also recently published a thorough report on popular conservative influencer Jake Shields’ abhorrent claim that Hitler “wasn’t pushing hatred towards other races.”\n\nAnd these aren’t isolated incidents. Hitler-loving rapper Ye and white nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, whom Donald Trump hosted for dinner in 2022, were both seen this week in a since-deleted video posted by Ye on X, in which the rapper was wearing a swastika necklace seemingly made out of diamonds.\n\nAnd Leo Terrell, the former Fox News contributor tapped to lead Trump’s so-called antisemitism task force, recently shared a prominent white nationalist’s tweet saying the president can “revoke someone’s Jew card,” in response to a tweet with footage of Trump’s antisemitic claim that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “used to be Jewish — he’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.”\n\nAll this to say: Don’t be gaslit. As the Trump administration uses claims of antisemitism to crack down on civil rights, the president is leading a movement growing more emboldened in its support for Nazi apologists, Nazi ideology and Hitler himself.",

Making matters far worse, Lutnick — who was confirmed by the Senate and holds an important position of public trust — took it upon himself to urge a national television audience to buy a specific stock tied to the sitting president’s top campaign donor.\n\nIf his Democratic predecessor, Gina Raimondo, took such a step, urging Americans to buy stock in a company led by Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor, it seems likely that more than a few congressional Republicans would've called for her resignation.\n\nOf course, Lutnick has plenty of company. Trump didn’t just give Musk enormous power in his administration, the president also hosted what was effectively an infomercial for Tesla on the White House South Lawn after the company’s stock value had dropped sharply.\n\nMore recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared on Fox Business and declared, “If you’re gonna touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out, because we’re coming after you.”\n\nSoon after, The New York Times reported that Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Musk’s SpaceX, has been “routed through a White House data center.”\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, Politico reported, “A top Commerce Department official sent a blistering email to his former colleagues on his way out the door Sunday warning that the Trump administration is poised to unduly enrich Elon Musk’s satellite internet company with money for rural broadband. The technology offered by Starlink, Musk’s company, is inferior, wrote Evan Feinman, who had directed the $42.5 billion broadband program for the past three years.”\n\nIf there’s a benign defense for all of this, I can’t think of it.",

        "title": "Democrats are failing to meet the moment amid Trump’s unconstitutional power grab",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 19 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nThe movement to resist Donald Trump’s unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions: How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined “All In.” The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis — that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday’s show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader “meeting the moment” if they don’t believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump’s intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission, these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump’s whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it’s not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump’s will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one, for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end — when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats — one that is not totally wrong — that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues, like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump’s trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don’t think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n‘This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,’ Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don’t have to choose. It’s all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump’s entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer’s Democratic colleagues believe it’s time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n“This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,” Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday. “And I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that’s a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there’s a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets — not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people — if we’re not willing to take risks ourselves?”\n\nNow is the time to take political risks — before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American.",

        "title": "Elon Musk’s Pentagon briefing to include information on China, sparking controversy",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A few weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, the president announced he was deploying Elon Musk, his top campaign donor, to conduct an audit of the Pentagon, which quickly became controversial for reasons the Republican didn’t appear to understand.\n\nMusk, among other things, is a defense contractor who does business with governments around the world. Common sense and a basic understanding of ethics would suggest just about anyone else would be better suited to oversee an audit of the Department of Defense’s finances.\n\nA month later, the billionaire megadonor is preparing to visit the Pentagon, where Musk will apparently receive a notable briefing. NBC News reported:\n\nTech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk is scheduled to visit the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that will include a discussion on China, according to three defense officials. The officials said the briefing will be unclassified, two of the officials said.\n\nAt this point, it’s worth pausing to note the variety of reports on this from several prominent news organizations, many of which included provocative details that haven’t been confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News.\n\nThe Washington Post, for example, reported that the Pentagon will provide Musk with an unclassified briefing focused in part “on the threat posed by China,” adding that China will be “the main focus of the discussion.” The Associated Press, meanwhile, reported on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledging that he’d meet with Musk, but the discussion, according to the far-right former Fox News host, would emphasize “innovation” and “efficiencies.”\n\nOther outlets, however, pointed in an even more alarming direction. The Wall Street Journal, for example, reported that Musk is poised to receive information on “the U.S. military’s top-secret war plans for China,” including “maritime tactics and targeting plans.” The Journal’s report, citing two unnamed U.S. officials, noted that the briefing — which is being held at the billionaire’s request — could give Musk “access to sensitive military secrets unavailable to business competitors.”\n\nFinally, there’s The New York Times’ report, which included details that dovetail with the Journal’s reporting, noting that the briefing would include information on “the U.S. military’s plan for any war that might break out with China.”\n\nThe Times added that this briefing, if it proceeds, “would also bring into sharp relief the questions about Mr. Musk’s conflicts of interest as he ranges widely across the federal bureaucracy while continuing to run businesses that are major government contractors. In this case, Mr. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of both SpaceX and Tesla, is a leading supplier to the Pentagon and has extensive financial interests in China.”\n\nIt’s that last point that is of particular interest. Musk isn’t just a billionaire and Republican megadonor. He also isn’t just overseeing a quasi-governmental “department” in the executive branch. Musk is also businessman with extensive financial interests in China and close contacts with China’s government.\n\nAll of which is to say, providing Musk with sensitive military information about China represents a profound and unnecessary risk.\n\nFor his part, Trump published an item to his social media platform insisting that China “will not even be mentioned or discussed” during the DOGE chief’s visit to the Defense Department. Of course, if the president still had any credibility, such a denial might be more convincing. (The Republican added soon after, \"Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\" The War Department became the Defense Department in 1949.)\n\nPolitico noted that Musk responded to the developments with threatening rhetoric, writing online that he looks “forward to the prosecution of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information” to the Times. “They will be found,” he added.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration confirmed Wednesday that it has slashed funds for a research program that had been tracking children believed to have been abducted during Russia’s deadly invasion of Ukraine. The move delivers a tremendous gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nCNN reports a State Department spokesperson said the administration cut funding for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, run out of Yale University, which had been documenting possible war crimes committed by Putin’s army. The group relied on a database to compile evidence related to “the abduction of the Ukrainian children ... attacks on energy infrastructure, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and destruction of cultural sites.”\n\nPer the report:\n\nThe database was specifically structured to pull together relevant elements for prosecution of war crimes, the source said. It is unclear who has access to the database, what will happen to the critical evidence it holds, and whether it will be able to be shared with the entities like the European Union law enforcement agency Europol.\n\nTrump’s administration is taking offline a powerful tool that was being used to hold Putin accountable, while simultaneously making it more difficult to reunite as many as 30,000 Ukrainian children with their families. It’s still unclear whether the data that’s already been compiled is still recoverable, according to CNN’s report.\n\nIt’s a sinister move by an administration that has been disturbingly deferential to Russia as of late, even by Trump’s standards. My colleague Steve Benen wrote about reports (unconfirmed by NBC News or MSNBC) that the administration has suspended efforts to counter Russian sabotage attempts, cyberattacks and attempts to spread disinformation. Just last month, Trump caused an embarrassing scene in the Oval Office in a televised meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, doing damage to the relationship and the U.S.’s standing on the world stage. More recently the administration acquiesced to a Kremlin demand that Trump’s Ukraine-Russia envoy, former Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, be excluded from the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, on the grounds that Kellogg is too supportive of Ukraine.\n\nIt’s abundantly clear why some Russian media figures could hardly contain their glee when Trump started assembling his Cabinet this year. They could not have engineered a more pro-Russian president than Donald Trump.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This summer will mark 10 years since Donald Trump first descended the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.\n\nNow, two months into his second term, it’s becoming painfully clear that many of the people best positioned to push back against his agenda still haven't accepted how much the world has changed.\n\nThe latest example came from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in \"Mad House,\" an upcoming book from Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of The New York Times, which revealed a 2023 exchange in which he said Trump was an aberration.\n\n“Here’s my hope … after this election, when the Republican Party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican Party,\" he said, according to the book.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this quote other than its needlessly vivid imagery.\n\nI remember the “old” Republican Party well. I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party’s nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump’s acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell. Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney’s physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife’s appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a “sniveling coward.” Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump’s brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today’s Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists — all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don’t want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others’ depravity because they know today’s Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights, now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people’s bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state.\n\nEven Trump’s most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there’s Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "content": "As international fears of Russian sabotage campaigns grow, common sense might suggest that U.S. officials would be ramping up its efforts to combat Moscow’s tactics. According to a Reuters report, however, the Trump administration is doing largely the opposite.\n\nSeveral U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks, easing pressure on Moscow as the Trump Administration pushes Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, Biden administration officials briefed the incoming Trump administration during the transition period, urging the Republican team “to continue monitoring Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign.”\n\nAfter Donald Trump’s inauguration, however, “much of the work has come to a standstill,” Reuters added. The same report went on to say, “Some officials involved in the working groups said they are concerned that the Trump administration is de-prioritizing the issue despite intelligence warnings. The change follows the unwinding of other Russia-focused projects launched by Biden’s administration.”\n\nIt’s that last point that’s of particular interest. The Reuters report, in isolation, is unsettling. But considered in a broader context, the pattern paints an even more alarming image.\n\nLast week, for example, Vladimir Putin and his regime let U.S. officials know that they did not want retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg — the White House’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia — to be involved in ceasefire negotiations. Trump promptly reassigned him. Around the same time, the White House abandoned the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe developments were hardly unfamiliar:\n\nAnd did I mention that Senate Republicans, at Trump’s behest, confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s director of national intelligence, despite her habit of echoing Russian propaganda? Because that happened, too.\n\nWhat’s more, this list might yet grow. Reuters also recently reported that the administration is also eyeing an overhaul to existing U.S. sanctions on Russia.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario in which Putin spoke privately to Trump and provided the American president with a to-do list. Would it look much different than the White House’s agenda from the last two months?\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "After the Trump administration lost yet another court fight this week, his top campaign donor, Elon Musk, turned to a familiar complaint. “This is a judicial coup,” the Republican megadonor wrote by way of his social media platform. “We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people.”\n\nAs my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained soon after, Musk flubbed every relevant detail in his missive: It’s not a “coup” when the White House loses court fights; senators aren’t responsible for impeaching anyone; and the standard for removing a sitting judge from the bench is 67 votes, not 60.\n\nBut despite his lack of familiarity with the impeachment process, the billionaire has been pushing the idea of judicial impeachments with unnerving vigor in recent weeks. Indeed, NBC News noted Wednesday that Musk had posted online about judicial impeachments “17 times within the past 24 hours.”\n\nWhat’s more, as The New York Times reported, he’s also putting his money where his tweets are.\n\nElon Musk has made the maximum allowable donation to Republican members of Congress who support impeaching federal judges who are impeding actions taken by President Trump, according to five people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Musk has given what had been until recently the legal maximum hard-dollar donation — $6,600 — to the campaigns of seven Republicans who have either endorsed judicial impeachments or called for some form of ‘action’ in response to recent rulings against the Trump administration, including a weekend decision by Judge James E. Boasberg of Federal District Court in Washington.\n\nAccording to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the beneficiaries of the campaign contributions include Republican Reps. Eli Crane of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin and Brandon Gill of Texas. Unexpectedly, Musk also donated to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who hasn’t explicitly endorsed impeaching any judges, but who did criticize a recent court ruling in the Alien Enemies Act case.\n\nTo be sure, the legal maximum for hard-dollar donations is rather modest — for someone of Musk’s wealth, $6,600 checks will not be missed — but there’s a broader political significance: The DOGE chief just sent an unsubtle signal to members of Congress that judicial impeachment advocates on Capitol Hill should expect to be rewarded by the biggest GOP megadonor of them all.\n\nPolitico also reported, “House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan said he plans to hold hearings on recent judicial rulings against the Trump administration’s agenda, after President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and conservatives have called for impeaching federal judges.”\n\nThe Ohio Republican told CNN, “We’re gonna hold hearings on this entire issue,” adding that he's especially interested in “the 15 injunctions that have been done in an eight-week time frame.”\n\nOf course, as we’ve discussed, that the White House has faced so many injunctions in so little time is less evidence of judicial bias and more evidence of an administration that keeps pushing the legal envelope in radical and unprecedented ways.\n\nNevertheless, Team Trump wants the idea of judicial impeachments to be taken seriously, and evidently the Jordan-led House Judiciary Committee is prepared to examine the issue in more detail.\n\nThere are, however, apparently some divisions among GOP lawmakers. In a separate report this week, Politico quoted one House Republican saying, “I do not support impeaching a sitting judge based solely on a decision with which I disagree.”\n\nThat the unnamed member didn’t want to be identified speaks volumes about the current state of the party.",

        "title": "John Roberts and Elon Musk are both wrong about Trump's push to impeach judges",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has always had a skeptical view of judicial independence. He’s long praised those who rule in his favor as wise jurists while denouncing any who rule against him as biased and not worthy of their robes. But he reached a new low in this area on Tuesday, when he called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to be impeached for halting his attempts to ship Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.\n\nThis escalation added fuel to an already simmering debate on the right about how to respond to federal judges who block Trump’s agenda. Chief Justice John Roberts and billionaire Elon Musk have weighed in on opposite sides of Trump’s call to impeach Boasberg. And both Musk’s and Roberts’ positions are wrong.\n\nBoth Musk’s and Roberts’ positions are wrong.\n\nThe chief justice prompted breaking news push alerts on Tuesday when he issued a rare statement criticizing Trump’s call for impeachment. “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” he wrote. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts has loved to hunt for the smallest nuance that can leave him technically correct. And here, again, he does have a point. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution says federal judges “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” This has been interpreted as granting them essentially lifetime appointments, in which they can’t just be replaced because political control changes hands in Washington.\n\nThe exception, of course, is when federal judges are impeached, something that has happened 15 times since the nation’s founding. Article II of the Constitution lays out frustratingly vague grounds for impeachment of the president and other “civil Officers of the United States”: “Treason, Bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The standard established over the years is that federal judges are impeachable only for actions taken outside the normal bounds of their role.\n\nBut Roberts also well knows that impeachment is a political tool, not a legal one. The question isn’t whether impeachment is constitutional or legal; it’s whether it would be, as the chief justice puts it, “appropriate.”\n\nThe Constitution gives the power of impeachment to the legislative branch, not the judicial branch. Article I states that the House has the “sole Power of Impeachment,” while the Senate has the “sole Power to try all Impeachments.” Unlike under the Federal Standards of Criminal Procedure that prosecutors must adhere to in court, the bar for investigating impeachable offenses and determining guilt is essentially whatever the House and the Senate says it is. And the courts have constantly upheld the idea that they can’t really step in on matters of impeachment, including against members of the bench, as those powers are given solely to Congress. In theory, there’s nothing stopping Republicans from lining up an impeachment vote on every federal judge a Democratic president has named.\n\nWhich brings us to Musk, who has endorsed an “impeachathon” event that far-right Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., plans to hold online, targeting at least 11 judges for removal. On Wednesday, he said on X that America is experiencing a “judicial coup” that requires “60 senators to impeach the judges and restore the rule of the people.” As my colleague Jordan Rubin explained, Musk is instantly wrong on several fronts here, including the threshold for removal in the Senate. It requires two-thirds of the Senate to agree, or 67 votes, which is 14 more than the GOP currently has in its caucus.\n\nThe floundering that we’re seeing because Trump hates losing is all very funny to me, personally, amid a very unfunny time.\n\nIt’s up to the House to impeach an official first, though, and there’s a math problem there, too. Republicans do control the House and need only a majority vote to impeach. But that majority is so narrow that Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has little room for error for anything to pass on a party-line vote. That didn’t stop Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who wrote on X on Tuesday that he had introduced articles of impeachment against Boasberg. That makes Boasberg the fifth federal judge to have articles filed against him since Trump was inaugurated but the first with the president’s endorsement.\n\nThis situation is set to be a political headache for Johnson. The speaker already has enough on his plate, including passing a major tax cut plan and other parts of the Trump agenda. Now he also is feeling pressure from his right flank to at least consider impeaching judges, something that at best crowds the House’s schedule further and calls attention to Trump’s consistent losses in court. Johnson was in a similar position last year when dealing with the laughable attempts to impeach President Joe Biden. This year, though, Trump is on his case from the White House, not Mar-a-Lago.\n\nEven if Johnson does push through an impeachment resolution or two, those are simply analogous to a prosecutor’s filing charges in the criminal justice system. The Senate would hold the trial, and Politico reports that there is simply no appetite for that right now in the upper chamber. Yes, the Senate could conduct those trials via a specialized committee to keep the proceedings from taking up time on the floor. But a show trial behind closed doors that ends in acquittal would be doubly pointless.\n\nThe floundering that we’re seeing because Trump hates losing is all very funny to me, personally, amid a very unfunny time. Impeachment should be used to hold public officials accountable, especially those who are unelected, but it’s been shown to be toothless in cases when partisanship can come into play. In this case, what is almost always taken as a flaw in the system is ironically exactly what’s preventing impeachment from being abused to Trump’s benefit.",

        "title": "Trump's partnership with El Salvador on deportations is a power grab",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump kicked off his first presidential campaign by implying that most everyone crossing the U.S.-Mexican border was a criminal.\n\nNow he’s using 1798’s Alien Enemies Act to operationalize that idea by deporting people accused of being gang members without any due process that might allow them to challenge the claim. And he’s citing the centuries-old law as his rationale for sending those he deems gang members to one of the most brutal and notorious prisons in El Salvador and, indeed, the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIt also serves as an example of Trump using obscure legal provisions to test how far he can take his autocratic agenda to expand executive power.\n\nTrump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, turned into grotesque display via a three-minute propaganda video shared by El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, is chilling. It allows him to dehumanize and vilify migrants as \"monsters\" to justify the expense of and obsession with deporting as many of them as possible. It also serves as an example of Trump using obscure legal provisions to test how far he can take his autocratic agenda to expand executive power.\n\nUnderstand, nothing compels Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act. If he wants to deport undocumented migrants from the U.S., even adjudicated gang members, he could cite the same laws his predecessors used to detain and deport them. (He’s been citing those more commonly used laws for most deportations.)\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used to detain and deport people from the U.S. during three times in American history, and in those cases it was used against nationals from countries at war with the U.S. But the more than 200 Venezuelans whom Trump has sent to El Salvador under the auspices of that law are from a country that the U.S. is not at war with. Trump’s effort to use the law was temporarily blocked by a federal judge who ordered the administration to turn the planes around, but unsuccessfully. (The Trump administration's position is that the courts can’t review Trump’s political determinations under the act.) Bukele taunted the judge on X, “Oopsie … Too late,” and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tesla CEO Elon Musk reposted it.\n\nWhen I asked Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, what’s the point of Trump using the Alien Enemies Act, he said: “I can’t speak exactly to their arguments, because they have yet to fully articulate that rationale, but the seeming obvious argument is that Trump campaigned on the issue, and he is trying to make a spectacle.”\n\nThat spectacle is best captured by the astonishing video Bukele shared on X on Sunday celebrating his imprisonment of the people accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The video is a hard but necessary watch, showing El Salvadoran authorities roughly handling the alleged gang members, shaving their heads and sending them into prison cells — all alongside menacing-sounding synth-heavy music. Bukele said they will be imprisoned there for at least a year. The Salvadoran strongman — who has called himself the “world’s coolest dictator” — has sharply curtailed civil liberties in El Salvador and suspended constitutional rights for years under the banner of a “state of emergency” and has frequently swept innocent people into his Center for Terrorism Confinement mega prison.\n\nA CNN report about the prison described the cells as “built to hold 80 or so inmates,” and “the only furniture is tiered metal bunks, with no sheets, pillows or mattresses … an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing and a large jug for drinking water.” The men are kept in the cells 23.5 hours a day, and Bukele said in his post that they will “labor under the Zero Idleness program.”\n\nThis video is a remarkable artifact, inviting viewers to see the migrants as deserving of exploitation and brutality from a kind of international alliance of draconian carceral states.\n\nBut the premise that everyone sent to this hellish site is a gang member is dubious. “We have only the government’s word that any of these people are members of the gang,” Reichlin-Melnick said. “The government has offered no evidence to confirm gang membership. It has not offered those individuals subject to this any opportunity to argue that they are not a member of a gang, and the people that have been sent to this prison are very likely to include some individuals who have been falsely labeled a member of a gang.”\n\nFamilies of some of the people suspected to have been deported over the weekend have denied that the deportees have ties to gangs. And a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official admitted in a sworn declaration that “many of the [Tren de Aragua gang] members removed under the AEA do not have criminal records in the United States.”\n\nEven if we were to grant that many, or even all, of the people deported to El Salvador’s mega prison were gang members, Trump’s deportations would still be disturbing. Because neither the Alien Enemies Act nor peacetime immigration law permits people to be imprisoned abroad. On what authority does Trump get to decide that someone suspected of gang membership should do hard labor in a foreign prison? And what happens to them when they get there? (This prison is explicitly run on the ethos that its inmates are beyond rehabilitation.) This is effectively vigilante justice, being practiced upon the most legally vulnerable population in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act is a power grab that relies on — and further fuels — the demonization of migrants as a class of people who should not be accorded rights. It must be rejected.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump promoted Elon Musk’s Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy stock in the electric car company. And we’re seeing this whole-of-government effort backing the world’s richest person (and Trump’s top 2024 election donor) extend to the Department of Justice as well.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi most recently emphasized her support of Musk on Thursday, when she issued a press release headlined, “Attorney General Pamela Bondi Announces Severe Charges Against Violent Tesla Arsonists.” The release didn’t name specific defendants or charges but summarized allegations against three people she said were “responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.” She said they’ll “face the full force of the law for using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations.”\n\nBondi said in the release that “the days of committing crimes without consequence have ended” and “if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”\n\nOne might object that the days of consequence-free crime haven’t so much “ended” as a new administration has new criminal justice priorities, beginning with Trump’s blanket pardoning of the Jan. 6 defendants. But each administration is entitled to its priorities within the confines of the law, and the DOJ’s latest announcement helps to solidify its policy of protecting those loyal to Trump and taking punitive action against others.\n\nOn that note, Ed Martin, the president’s pick to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the nation’s capital, has likewise pledged to bring the weight of the federal law against Musk’s opponents. And just this week, Bondi retweeted Musk’s posts about her Fox News television appearance and public statement touting law enforcement action against Tesla-related defendants.\n\nPutting aside the specifics of these cases, whatever criminal actions anyone takes against people or property shouldn’t escape prosecution based on the victim’s identity. That is, Musk’s person and property are no less legally deserving of protection than anyone else’s. But given the political incentive behind bringing these cases and any other related ones, they’ll deserve close scrutiny as they develop.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a year since the women’s NCAA Tournament national championship game eclipsed the men’s national championship game for the first time in viewership, ticket sales and hype. With the 2025 women’s tournament officially starting Friday, what have we learned about the world of women’s college basketball since Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and her LSU rival, Angel Reese, left for the WNBA?\n\nSimply put, the idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nThe idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nTo be clear, there’s a lot of doubt among television executives regarding whether this year’s women’s national championship game will reach the 19 million viewers that last year’s showdown between Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes and Kamilla Cardoso’s South Carolina Gamecocks got. It’s worth examining how the sport has done on major television networks following the departures of Clark, Reese and many of the other college players who transitioned to the pros.\n\nFor years, a catch-22 of women’s basketball has been the complaint from major networks like Fox, ABC and CBS that women’s sports doesn’t have a large enough fan base and the counter from fans that the fan base won’t grow if games aren’t televised. For so long, networks generally declined to show women’s college basketball on the most accessible television networks.\n\nHowever, as a result of the success last season, Fox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season. Fox broadcast 18 games during the 2024-25 season, including five games in prime-time Saturday night slots.\n\n“There are great stars, great brands. We’ve done more than we have done before, and we’re not alone in doing that,” Fox Sports’ president of insights and analytics, Mike Mulvihill, said.\n\nCBS broadcast this season’s Big Ten Tournament final for the second straight year. It included the third matchup of the season between Los Angeles rivals UCLA and USC, who have two superstar talents of their own. The Clark-vs.-Reese rivalry was only the beginning. I’ll come back to this.\n\nFox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season.\n\nThe Big Ten championship game drew 1.44 million viewers, and UConn vs. USC averaged 2.2 million viewers on a Fox Saturday night prime-time matchup. While there was a dip when it came to how Clark’s games did on these same networks a year before, these non-Clark games still got viewerships in the millions. That’s not nothing, and the numbers prove that viewers are drawn to other stars, too.\n\nAnd then there are ABC and ESPN. Their regular-season ratings were up 3% over last year and up 41% from the 2022-23 season. This was the most-watched women’s college basketball regular season since the season Tina Charles and Maya Moore led UConn to the national championship in 2009. There was a 120% year-over-year viewership increase in the three games televised on ABC, which averaged 1.3 million viewers a game.\n\nViewership of around 1 million people across multiple networks disproves the prediction that the women’s college game wouldn’t stay afloat after Clark and Reese left. Another sign the game is doing just fine: The average price for a 30-second commercial during this year’s women’s national championship game has more than doubled.\n\nA big reason an equal number of people, if not more, have watched women’s college basketball the season after Clark, Reese and Cardoso left is the wide array of talent teams have put on the court all season. According to ESPN Bet, there are six teams with better than 10-to-1 odds to win the national championship. Parity has been the name of the game this season.\n\nEach of those six teams has at least one generational talent who’s bound to have a successful WNBA career. Let’s begin with USC’s JuJu Watkins, a 6-2 two-way small forward who is a prolific scorer and gifted athlete. Watkins has played the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed, UCLA, and point center Lauren Betts three times and beaten them twice.\n\nBut both L.A. schools are on the same side of the bracket as UConn, which has Paige Bueckers, the 2021 National Player of the Year, who is playing in her final NCAA Tournament. With shooting guard Azzi Fudd and big wing Sarah Strong, Bueckers has more talent around her than she’s had in her entire UConn career.\n\nReese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nWe can’t forget about Notre Dame, which has a three-headed monster in its backcourt: flashy pass-first guard Olivia Miles, defense-minded slashing guard Hannah Hidalgo and do-it-all wing Sonia Citron. But to win the championship, the Fighting Irish will have to get through Texas, led by three-level scoring point forward Madison Booker, and the defending champions, the South Carolina Gamecocks, who are arguably the deepest team in the field.\n\nThe Gamecocks don’t have a true No. 1 option, but March Madness is when superstars are born. Does speedy and shifty guard MiLaysia Fulwiley emerge as South Carolina’s unstoppable force? We’ll have to see.\n\nPeople don’t have to know that Clark is playing to watch women play basketball. The new 3-on-3 professional league Unrivaled aggressively pursued her to play in its inaugural season. She decided against it. Still, 364,000 viewers (the second most who’d ever watched an Unrivaled game), watched the first-ever championship game. Other WNBA stars, including Reese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nIn the same way, Watkins, Bueckers, Hidalgo, Miles, Booker and Fulwiley will keep March Madness humming following the departure of Clark. The women’s basketball boom was never about one player, and now we have the numbers that prove it.",

        "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano in south-central Indonesia erupted three times into Friday, sending an ash column 8,000 meters (26,200 feet) high and prompting authorities to expand the danger zone around the volcano.\n\nThe volcano on the remote island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara province has had hundreds of earthquakes and visible volcanic activity has significantly increased in the last seven days.\n\nAn eruption followed by an explosion was heard Thursday evening as far away as Larantuka and Maumere, two cities about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the volcano. The eruption was recorded at several monitoring stations on Flores island, Muhammad Wafid, chief of Indonesia’s Geology Agency, said in a statement.\n\nThere were two other eruptions, and smaller activity occurred during the day Friday. Smoke blew around the crater with weak to moderate pressure, and firelight was seen at the peak, indicating the glowing volcanic material was at a shallow depth.\n\nAuthorities raised the eruption alert to the highest level and expanded the danger zone from 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater. No new evacuations were ordered.\n\nSeveral airlines canceled flights between Australia and Indonesia’s tourist island of Bali, while other international and domestic flights to the island have been delayed.\n\nResidents were warned to be vigilant about heavy rainfall triggering lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano, Indonesia’s geology agency said in a statement.\n\nAn eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in November killed nine people and injured dozens.\n\nThe 1,584-meter (5,197 foot) mountain is a twin volcano with Mount Lewotobi Perempuan in the Flores Timur district.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of 270 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanos and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",

        "title": "The Bidens want back in",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — Former President Joe Biden has told some Democratic leaders he’ll raise funds, campaign and do anything else necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped design, according to people close to him.\n\nBiden privately met last month with the new Democratic National Committee chairman, Ken Martin, and offered to help as the party struggles to regain its viability amid polling that shows its popularity has been sinking, the people said.\n\nSo far, Biden's overture seems to have fallen flat. Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger.\n\nWhoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue.\n\n“Who’s going to want Joe Biden back in the game?” said a major Biden supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about him.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC didn’t provide a comment or make Martin available for an interview.\n\nA new NBC News poll shows that the Democratic Party’s popularity has dropped to a record low. Only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party — the lowest figure in the network’s polling dating to 1990.\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden is also prepared to campaign and raise money for fellow Democrats as she and her husband settle into life back home in Delaware, a person close to her said.\n\n“She recognizes that serving in the capacities that she served is an honor and it comes with responsibilities to the party. And she’s prepared to help in any way she can,” the person said.\n\nBoth Bidens are carving out post-presidential lives aside from the partisan political work they've volunteered to take on.\n\nEach plans to write a book. As Biden develops a theme for his memoir, he has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti.\n\nHe has been splitting his time between Delaware and Washington for meetings in office space supplied by the federal government. As was his habit as a U.S. senator, he often commutes via Amtrak.\n\nThe onetime first couple were shocked when President Donald Trump abruptly announced this week that he was ending Secret Service protection for their two adult children, Hunter and Ashley, the person close to Jill Biden said. They'd gotten no warning, another person familiar with the matter said. Their first question was whether their two children would be safe.\n\nThe Bidens have been out of office for only two months. After Trump’s first term ended in 2021, then-President Biden extended protection for Trump’s adult children for six months.\n\nThough Biden is willing to help, Democrats aren’t unanimous in wanting them to. Some party activists believe Biden is an admired figure who remains a draw inside a grateful party.\n\nJane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, said in an interview: “If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters.”\n\nOthers argue that reminding voters of a 2024 campaign that went sour isn’t the best strategy for a party that is grasping for a message and searching for new, younger leaders. A CNN poll this month asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents which leader best reflects the party’s core values. Only 1% chose Biden.\n\nWhat’s more, the wounds of 2024 are still fresh, with many Democrats aggrieved over Biden’s decision to run again and remain in the race until just a few months before the election, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris little time to organize a campaign of her own.\n\nAlan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Philadelphia, said in an interview: “There are plenty of people in the Democratic Party who were obviously very frustrated with how things played out last year, but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden.\"\n\nAt the “appropriate time,” Biden can be an asset to the party by campaigning in selected areas, such as his hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, but now isn’t it, Kessler added.\n\n“It’s time to move on with new leadership,” he said.\n\nBiden has no pangs of regret, a person familiar with his private conversations said. He remains defiant and believes Trump’s victory shows the party did itself no favors by pushing him to drop out of the race, the source said.\n\nOne person in particular seems eager to see Biden return to the political stage: Trump. The new president has used his massive following to ensure that Americans don’t soon forget the old one.\n\nTrump has publicly mentioned Biden, Biden family members or the Biden administration an average of seven times a day since the start of his second term, according to an NBC News review of his remarks, interviews and social media posts.\n\nOverall, Trump has invoked his predecessor in some form more than 400 times since the inauguration on Jan. 20. In most instances — more than 325 — Trump has mentioned Biden alone. In about 75 cases, Trump has mentioned Biden family members or the Biden administration.\n\nThe context in which Trump brings up his predecessor often involves immigration, inflation, elections or foreign wars, as well as issues involving the Justice Department.\n\nSpeaking at the Justice Department last week, Trump questioned Biden’s use of an autopen to sign documents, calling it “disrespectful to the office” and \"maybe not even valid.\"\n\nThe Justice Department blessed the use of an autopen in a memo in 2005, and the Constitution carries no requirement that the president sign documents by his own hand.\n\nVice President JD Vance also uses Biden as a foil. At a tech summit this week, Vance took time in his speech to take a swipe at Biden’s mental acuity — an issue that dogged the former president throughout the campaign.\n\n“In defense of Joe Biden, he was asleep most of the time. I don’t think he totally realized what he was doing,” Vance said.\n\nAsked why Trump speaks about Biden so frequently, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “We still very much are fixing so many of the problems created or started by the Biden administration. It’s important to remind the American people and media why these problems exist.\"\n\nA defense that Trump supporters use in rationalizing his attacks on perceived political foes is that he’s a “counterpuncher.” But here, Biden has already left the ring. He hasn’t thrown any public punches since Trump escorted him to the helicopter on Inauguration Day for his departure from the U.S. Capitol grounds.\n\nIndeed, Biden’s first speaking event since he left office came last week with no fanfare whatsoever. He appeared in New York City for a conference of the National High School Model United Nations in Manhattan. Six months after having spoken before the actual U.N. for his last time as president, Biden gave a speech to its high school facsimile in a hotel ballroom. He also took questions and posed for pictures with students.\n\n“He asked me about my future, and I told him how much he inspired me to go into the field of politics,” said Suzy Radzinski, 18, a senior at Brighton High School in Utah, who met Biden on the photo line.\n\nA Facebook video from the event showed a group of excited students waving to Biden. “I met you on your book tour!” one shouted to him as he stood onstage in a suit and tie. “All right!” said Biden, prompting appreciative laugher.\n\nInside Biden’s close-knit circle, advisers have concluded that it’s not wise for him to respond publicly to every insult or accusation Trump throws his way. Doing so would personalize the issue, turning it into a contest between Trump and Biden, as opposed to keeping the focus on whether Trump is being truthful or not.\n\nBiden’s approach for now is to let surrogates respond to Trump’s broadsides. Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist, said that’s the right posture.\n\n“It makes no sense for Joe Biden to respond to Donald Trump,” she said in an interview. “The American people are not looking backward; they’re looking forward.”\n\nRather than take the attacks personally, Jill Biden has found a new role for herself: soothing those who are unnerved by the tumult in Washington, the person close to her said.\n\n“She is finding herself comforting people. More and more, as she’s out and about, people come up to her who are looking for reassurance,\" the person said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Who was the father: Her fiancé, or the man with whom she had a brief fling?\n\nIn Oct. 2024, that was the urgent question for a New York City woman.\n\nShe thought she got her answer when a paternity test showed there was a 99.9% probability her unborn baby was the product of that short-lived fling. The results, she says, prompted her to have an abortion in order to preserve her relationship with her fiancé.\n\n“I decided to save my marriage,” she said. “I was already five months pregnant. I decided to terminate the pregnancy.”\n\nFour months later, the woman, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, says she got a startling message from DNA Diagnostics Center, the testing company, which was now seeking to amend its original paternity results.\n\nThe company had just issued a new, corrected report which showed there was now a 0% chance the other man from that fling was the father.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the NBC New York I-Team, the woman said she would never have ended her pregnancy if the genetics company had gotten the results correct the first time. She’s now suing DNA Diagnostics Center, claiming the company’s negligence left her relationship in ruins.\n\n“You took away the family I could have had. This was the person I was marrying. This is the person I wanted to build a family with,” she said. “The reason I took action was because I believed in these results. I thought this was something that was one hundred percent true. And it led me to the abortion.”\n\nDNA Diagnostics Center, declined to answer questions about the paternity test mix-up. Instead, the company sent the I-Team a statement emphasizing its genetics testing methods are sound.\n\n“Over the past 30 years, DDC has provided reliable and accurate testing to millions of customers,” the statement read. “If any issue or concern is raised, we take immediate action, and DDC will perform a retest to validate the initial result. We have established industry-leading processes and best practices across our laboratory and company to ensure customers are rapidly notified of any issues and quality assurance steps are followed.”\n\nThe company also declined to explain how it came to review the woman’s initial genetic results months after they were issued — or whether that review included other paternity tests which might also have suffered problems.\n\nThe woman told the I-Team she was uncomfortable about the paternity test almost from the beginning, because she says DNA Diagnostics directed her to have blood drawn at a Bronx address which appears to also house a beauty salon that offers cosmetic procedures like facials, body contouring, eyelash, and hair/scalp treatments.\n\n“If you’re going in to ask for a paternity test, you don’t want to go do that in front of people who are getting their hair done,” said Craig Phemister, the woman’s attorney.\n\nThe third-party Bronx company which collected the woman’s genetic sample declined comment.\n\nAccording to the DNA Diagnostics website, the Ohio company is “the World’s Leading Relationship DNA Testing Center,” having conducted more than 20 million DNA tests since 1995.\n\nPhemister said he believes the sheer number of genetic tests completed by the company suggests there could be more errors.\n\n“The field this company is in is a field that cannot have mistakes like this,” he said. “I’m sure we’re going to find, and time will tell, there will be other people that come forward and learn that these same things have happened to them.”\n\nThis is not the first time DNA Diagnostics Center has been accused of making genetics testing errors which have enormous ripple effects for families and relationships.\n\nIn 2018, Joel Santiago, a parent from Connecticut, sued the firm after one of its paternity tests concluded he was not the biological father of his first-born child.\n\nAbout 18 months later, Santiago says he got amended results from DNA Diagnostics Center showing the opposite conclusion — that he actually was her dad. But by that time, he said his relationship with the child’s biological mother had ended, effectively depriving him of participating in the first two years of his daughter’s childhood.\n\n“It completely changed the trajectory of my life,” Santiago said. “Precious moments like naming my child, witnessing her birth, watching her first steps, were all erased.”\n\nJoel Santiago’s lawsuit against DNA Diagnostics ended with a jury awarding him $2.5 million in damages.\n\nSteven Errante, the attorney who won that award, said — because the company admitted liability for the laboratory error — the trial mostly focused on damages. Thus, he said he was limited in his ability to get to the bottom of exactly how the DNA testing firm discovered there was an issue with Joel’s original results.\n\n“It was always mystifying to us because, in Joel’s case, it was almost eighteen months later that they called him to say they’ve made a mistake,” Errante said. “Why would you be looking at these results eighteen months later? We never really got an answer.”\n\nDNA Diagnostics declined to answer questions about Joel Santiago’s paternity test or how the decision was made to issue corrected results.\n\nPaternity tests make up only part of the company’s business. According to the DNA Diagnostics Center website, the firm also provides DNA testing for government agencies, including genetic testing for law enforcement in criminal cases and immigration proceedings.\n\nPhemister believes his client’s experience with mistaken paternity results raises questions about DNA Diagnostics facilities which may provide results in a whole host of civil and criminal contexts.\n\n“The same DNA labs are doing testing that is relied on by the court systems,” Phemister said. “If they make errors and then not discover those errors for months or years later, that’s it. These people’s lives are devastated.”",

        "title": "'Severance' season 2 finale leaves 'outies' with another cliffhanger — and season 3 is on the way",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Warning: This article contains spoilers for the show \"Severance.\"\n\nA goat, a marching band and a big decision.\n\n\"Severance\", the Apple TV+ series that has become a cultural phenomenon, ended its second season Thursday with another major cliffhanger. The finale provided answers — or at least some semblance of clarity — around many major questions, but the future of the show's main characters (both innies and outies) remains in doubt.\n\nFans can take some solace in Apple's announcement Friday morning that the show will return for a third season.\n\nBy far Apple's biggest streaming hit, the show has generated a sizable viewership as well as a cottage industry of internet sleuthing and memes. \"Severance\" was among the top trending topics on X on Friday morning.\n\nAnd much like the first season, \"Severance\" waited for the last scene to throw its biggest curveball. Just as it looks like Mark Scout (Adam Scott) will be able to escape Lumon with his wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), his \"innie\" makes a startling decision: to stay inside the building and with his own love, Helly R. (Britt Lower).\n\nThe decision marks a turning point for the show. While the combative dynamics between the innies and Lumon remain, the growing tension between the innies and outies on the show is poised to become the primary source of conflict — between Mark S and Mark Scout, and between Helly R and Helena Eagan.\n\nIt’s a split that is already showing some signs of fracturing fans who are inclined to root for either the innies or the outies.\n\nSome fans were moved by the grand gesture from Mark S.\n\n“SEVERANCE IS A LOVE STORY,” wrote one X user, with an image of the final shot.\n\nAs has become common for \"Severance\" fan reactions on the internet, the memes flowed.\n\nThe sci-fi series follows a group of workers at fictional Lumon Industries who have undergone a so-called severance procedure, permanently dividing their consciousnesses between their work and personal lives. “Innies” and “outies” have no memories of the other’s life.\n\nFans have become captivated by the show’s dystopian premise, as well as the cohort of “innies” that make up Lumon’s dedicated Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team: Mark S. (Adam Scott), Dylan G. (Zach Cherry), Helly R. (Britt Lower) and Irving B. (John Turturro). Throughout season two, all of the members grapple with their existence as they learn more about their “outies.”\n\nMark Scout (the outie of Mark S.) secretly begins “reintegration,” a painful brain surgery process that would meld his “innie” and “outie” in order to try and remember his experiences as both. It’s all part of an effort to find his wife, Gemma, who was thought to have died in a car accident two years prior but is actually being experimented on by Lumon employees somewhere in the building.\n\nThe season two finale revolves around “outie” Mark’s mission to save Gemma from the depths of Lumon. Thanks to help from his sister, Devon (Jen Tullock), and former severed floor manager Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), Mark Scout is able to make an appeal to his \"innie,\" Mark S.\n\nTheir conversation — conducted via recorded messages back and forth on a video camera — becomes heated. Mark S. shares his reluctance to save someone he doesn’t actually know, especially because Gemma’s reunion with Mark Scout would likely mean the lives of all “innies” (including his love interest, Helly R.) will come to an end.\n\nBack on the severed floor, Mark S. decides to fulfill his outie’s request after all. Helly R. and Dylan G. help by distracting floor manager Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman), who has thrown a celebration featuring “choreography and merriment” — a particularly surreal scene featuring an animatronic version of Lumon's mythological leader Kier Eagan and an extended performance from a marching band — to commemorate Mark S.’s completion of his work.\n\nMark S. makes his way to the testing floor where he becomes his \"outie,\" Mark Scout, and reunites with Gemma. They escape to the severed floor, where “innie” Mark S. escorts Gemma to a stairwell to help her leave Lumon for good.\n\nBut rather than go with her, Mark S. ends up choosing to stay behind with Helly R., and they run off, hand-in-hand, down the hallways of Lumon as Gemma looks on screaming Mark’s name.\n\n“NEVER. LET. YOUR. WIFE. STOP. YOU. FROM. FINDING. YOUR.

In Gemma’s storyline, it appears each of her consciousness’ experiences is personal to her outie’s tempers in some way, as Lumon tests the limits of the severed chip on the company’s quest to fulfill Kier Eagan’s imagined world without pain.\n\nThe countdown to Season 3 begins\n\nSince the show returned in January after a three-year hiatus, fans have inundated platforms like X and Reddit with memes, theories and even fan-cam edits. The massive fandom has helped make “Severance” Apple TV’s biggest hit, with millions of people tuning in week after week.\n\nBen Stiller, a director and executive producer of the show, has assured fans that there will not be as long of a hiatus between season two and three as there was between seasons one and two.\n\n“No, the plan is not to [wait three years],” Stiller told Travis and Jason Kelce on an episode of their podcast, “New Heights.” “Hopefully we’ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.”\n\nDuring a recent appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Stiller also teased that the creatives behind the series “know what the ending is, but how we’re getting there is the creative process.”\n\nIn the meantime, fans will have to sit tight — though that may be easier said than done.\n\n“More Severance please…NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!” wrote “The Daily Show Host” Jon Stewart, tagging Stiller in a post on X. “(but actually thank you for what we got!)”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — Tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk is scheduled to visit the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that will include a discussion on China, according to two defense officials.\n\nThe briefing will be unclassified, the officials said.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday night that Musk would be briefed on the U.S. military’s plans for any potential war with China, citing two U.S. officials. One official also confirmed that the briefing would be focused on China, and another only confirmed that Musk would be at the Pentagon on Friday, according to the Times' report.\n\nThe defense officials whom NBC News contacted could not confirm the Times' reporting on Musk being briefed on plans for any potential war with China, known as the operational plan or O plan.\n\nThe decision to brief Musk on military plans for China would mark a notable evolution of his involvement in the Trump administration and, potentially, his access to U.S. secrets. Musk, whom the president has charged with overseeing a government cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, could also have conflicts of interest, as Musk’s own products and businesses are used by the federal government, including Starlink and SpaceX, which contracts with the Defense Department.\n\nMusk also has deep financial interests in China — his electric vehicle maker Tesla has two facilities in Shanghai, and China is the company's second-largest market.\n\nTrump denied in a post on Truth Social late Thursday night that the briefing Musk was set to receive Friday would discuss China.\n\nThe president said the Times reported \"incorrectly, that Elon Musk is going to the Pentagon tomorrow to be briefed on any potential 'war with China.' How ridiculous?” China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!”\n\nAsked for comment about Musk's visit to the Pentagon, the White House referred to the president's Truth Social post.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth also denied the Times report, saying in a post on X \"this is NOT a meeting about 'top secret China war plans.' It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.”\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the Times’ reporting “100% Fake News” in a post on X. “Just brazenly & maliciously wrong. Elon Musk is a patriot. We are proud to have him at the Pentagon.”",

        "title": "Once again, a Trump win has 'insiders' questioning women's electability. Mikie Sherrill shrugs it off in New Jersey.",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss in the presidential race has given rise, again, to whispered worries in the Democratic Party about female candidates and electability — resurrecting a fraught conversation that bubbled for years after President Donald Trump’s first victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe whisper campaign has started to some extent in New Jersey, where this year’s governor’s race will be one of Democrats’ first big electoral tests since Trump won his second term.\n\nIn the Trump years, some Democratic voters and strategists have worried aloud about whether it’s “safe” to back female candidates if there are male voters who wouldn’t support them in general elections. It was a theme for parts of the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020, when the party was choosing a candidate to take on Trump.\n\nEven as some are once again questioning women's electability, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the only woman in the crowded New Jersey Democratic primary for governor, has been racking up support in large part because her backers believe she is best positioned to win in November. But Sherrill did acknowledge that broader questions about women’s ability to win persist.\n\n“I hear that from insiders,” Sherrill said in a recent interview. “And it’s funny, that’s always been kind of the case,” she added, saying someone at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told her during her first run for the House in 2018 that “people didn’t think a woman could win in New Jersey.”\n\n“And I was like, ‘What? Watch me,’” Sherrill said. She flipped the longtime Republican seat, winning it by 15 percentage points.\n\nSherrill has touted her electoral wins, along with her background as a Navy helicopter pilot and a prosecutor, as she looks to succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who can’t run for re-election because of term limits.\n\nSome Democrats in New Jersey are anxious about the race after the state shifted 10 points toward Trump in November, compared with 2020, and after Murphy won re-election four years ago by just 3 points. It has also been more than 60 years since the same party has won three consecutive terms for governor.\n\nAlthough Harris still carried New Jersey, her loss nationally has prompted some party officials and voters to raise questions about whether a woman can win this year’s governor’s race, according to four sources connected to New Jersey Democratic politics who described hearing those thoughts in conversations. (Several of Sherrill’s supporters said they haven’t heard those electability questions.)\n\n“Honestly, I have heard: ‘Ah, I don’t know, maybe women aren’t electable. Maybe there’s an issue here,’” said an official who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, noting that the questions began after November and have persisted in the primary for governor.\n\nDemocratic strategist Julie Roginsky said, \"It’s part of the same chatter that has always kept women from ascending in the Democratic Party in New Jersey.” Roginsky, who isn’t involved in the governor’s race, said she has also heard party officials raise the electability questions.\n\n\"This is not a particularly feminist Democratic Party in New Jersey,” Roginsky added later.\n\nMaking her case\n\nSherrill faces five other major candidates in the Democratic primary: Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney and former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller, who leads the state’s teachers union.\n\nSherrill has already racked up endorsements from party leaders, and she has won several county party conventions, earning the backing of the local parties’ rank-and-file members. (Fulop has declined to participate in conventions as he runs an anti-establishment campaign, while Gottheimer is skipping conventions where he believes “the fix is in,” according to the New Jersey Globe.)\n\nSeveral supporters of Sherrill, a veteran of battleground House campaigns, said they are backing her because they view her as the strongest general election candidate.\n\nElectability was “the most important factor” for Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo Jr.\n\n“I think she is our strongest candidate to win the primary and also the general, which I’m very much concerned about,” DiVincenzo said, noting that former state Assemblyman Jack Ciatarelli is running for governor again after having almost defeated Murphy in 2021.\n\nDiVincenzo and other Sherrill allies pointed to her win in the 11th District in northern New Jersey in 2018 as proof that she can win tough races. GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a scion of a political family who chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee, had represented the seat for more than two decades before Sherrill launched her campaign. Frelinghuysen announced his retirement several months later.\n\nSherrill went on to defeat GOP Assemblyman Jay Weber, flipping a district Trump had narrowly won in 2016. Sherrill said that in that race and subsequent campaigns she has won over Republicans and independents and built broad coalitions of progressives, union members and disillusioned voters.\n\n“Through building that huge coalition, I was able to win with the largest red-to-blue swing in the entire nation,” she said. “And I think that speaks to what I’ve been able to do, who I’ve been able to turn out, the coalitions I’ve been building. I think that is something that people are taking into account as they think about this primary.”\n\n“Half this field has never even run against a real Republican challenger,” Sherrill also said, appearing to refer to Fulop’s, Baraka’s and Spiller’s mayoral races.\n\nSweeney defeated a Democrat-turned-Republican incumbent for the state Senate in 2001, but he lost re-election 20 years later to underfunded Republican truck driver Ed Durr, who is also running for governor this year.\n\nGottheimer does have experience winning in Republican territory, having defeated GOP Rep. Scott Garrett in 2016 in his 5th District even as Trump narrowly carried the seat.\n\nBut Sherrill’s allies believe her victories stand out.\n\nEMILY’s List, which backs female candidates who support abortion rights and has endorsed Sherrill, detailed in a memo this month how Sherrill has earned more votes than her New Jersey Democratic colleagues and run ahead of candidates for higher office.\n\n“In any crowded primary, it’s really important to show that strength,” said EMILY’s List President Jessica Mackler, who said questions about electability typically come from “pundits and the media.”\n\nSherrill believes her record in office will also win over primary voters, even as “insiders” question female candidates’ electability.\n\n“I certainly think that insiders are always making these calculations,” she said.\n\n“But I think what people on the ground, what voters, care about is: Are you somebody that they trust? Are you somebody that can really deliver for them?” Sherrill said before she referred to a designation she received from the Center for Effective Lawmaking. “And after being named the most effective lawmaker in the New Jersey House delegation after only my second term in Congress, I think people see that I deliver.”\n\nStill an ‘all-boys club’?\n\nSome New Jersey Democrats say the electability doubts following Harris’ loss underscore a broader challenge for female candidates in the state.\n\nDemocrats have nominated a woman for governor only once, backing then-state Senate Sen. Barbara Buono to take on GOP Gov. Chris Christie in 2013. (New Jersey has had one female governor, Republican Christie Whitman, who served from 1994 to 2001.)\n\n“We knew they weren’t going to let us into the all-boys club, so we just decided we’ve got to kick in the door,” Buono said after her bruising loss to Christie.\n\nLeslie Huhn, a former Sussex County Democratic Committee chairwoman, said that there has been more support for women in the years since then but that “there’s still more work to be done in this area, no doubt about it.”\n\nHuhn, who runs the grassroots group Door to Door Democracy, which is backing Sherrill, has also heard electability questions from party insiders, but not from the grassroots. But Huhn isn’t concerned that the “all-boys club” will be an obstacle for Sherrill, saying plenty of men are also drawn to Sherrill’s military background.\n\n“They’re not worried that she’s not tough, because they know she’s tough. They know she’s strong,” said Huhn, who also said Sherrill has a unique ability to also be “warm and relatable.”\n\nSherrill is ready for a fight.\n\n“Working in the military or working in New Jersey politics, these are some intense people, and they’re not afraid to throw punches here,” she said, later adding, “The lessons you learn are just taking it on. Don’t shrink from it; don’t back away. If somebody wants to test you, meet the test and engage.”\n\nBut does Sherrill still see the state as the “all-boys club” that Buono described?\n\n“It’s changing. ... It is really rough and tumble. But I guess, I’ve been through a POW training camp in the Navy. I’m used to rough and tumble,” she said. “I’m ready to go.”",

        "content": "A graduate student from India with a student visa who had been teaching at Georgetown University.\n\nA professor at Brown University’s medical school who also has a valid visa and hails from Lebanon.\n\nA pro-Palestinian activist with a green card who recently graduated from Columbia University and has a baby on the way with his U.S. citizen wife.\n\nAll three scholars have been targeted by the Trump administration for deportation this month despite the fact that they all have papers allowing them to live and work in the U.S.\n\nIn each case, the Department of Homeland Security has justified its decision to kick them out of the country by citing an obscure provision in immigration law that dates to the Cold War and gives the secretary of state the authority to deport that person.\n\n“The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,” reads a document in one of the deportation cases, citing the provision.\n\nBack in 1952, when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, the aim was to keep Communists out of America.\n\nNow, the provision has become yet another legal weapon the Trump administration is deploying to fulfill its mandate to deport millions of migrants, experts said.\n\nAnd it's a potentially potent weapon, Gabriel J. Chin, a professor of law at UC Davis, wrote in a recent piece on the rights of green card holders that attempted to answer the question of whether the Trump administration could legally deport Khalil.\n\n\"While lawful permanent residents may not be criminally prosecuted for their political speech or activity, what they say or write may well affect their ability to remain in the U.S., if the government determines that they are a security risk,\" Chin wrote.\n\nUntil now, Homeland Security officials have mostly targeted the legions of desperate migrants who crossed into the country via the U.S.-Mexico border and who have claimed asylum but have no firm legal status in the U.S.\n\nBut the deportation of Brown University’s Dr. Rasha Alawieh to Lebanon and the detentions of Georgetown University’s Badar Khan Suri and Columbia University’s Mahmoud Khalil are signaling that the Trump administration also has in its crosshairs — and may be trying to make examples of — accomplished academics who may not be on the same page as the government when it comes to foreign policy.\n\nA protest against the deportation of Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University at the State House in Providence, R.I., on March 17. Joseph Prezioso / AFP - Getty Images\n\n\"There is no question that this is an attempt by Trump and his administration to chill the speech of academics, particularly those who are not U.S. citizens, that he does not agree with,\" Chin told NBC News. \"This is a new era.\"\n\nThat appears to be the case with Khalil, 30. An Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, Khalil is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. But he became a target of the Trump administration when he became the unmasked face of pro-Palestinian student demonstrations that roiled Columbia last year.\n\nImmigration agents arrested Khalil in front of his wife, Noor Abdalla, on March 8 in New York City and briefly took him to a detention center in New Jersey before transferring him to a facility in Louisiana. He has not been charged with a crime; Homeland Security officials said he was targeted because he \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge barred the government from deporting Khalil and ordered that his case be moved to New Jersey.\n\nKhalil, in a letter he dictated over the phone to his family, said he was a “political prisoner” who was “targeted” for advocating for the Palestinian cause. At least one other student at the Ivy League school was detained by immigration officials following the protests.\n\nSuri, who is believed to be 41, was detained on Monday by masked DHS agents as he was returning to the Virginia home he shares with his wife, Mapheze Saleh, and their three children. The detention was first reported by Politico.\n\nGeorgetown said it was not aware of Suri engaging in any “illegal activity,” and neither the DHS nor the State Department responded to questions from NBC on why Suri was taken into custody.\n\nBut Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said on X, in response to the Politico story, that Suri was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.”\n\nMcLaughlin also alleged that “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”\n\n\"He was simply commenting on the Israel-Palestine war, as many people do in this country, many people have opinions on it. He has a right to speak about political change,\" said Sophia Gregg, an attorney for ACLU of Virginia who represents Suri. \"There has been no allegation that he’s ever advocated for violence.\"\n\nGregg also said this matter isn't about \"some sort of familial relations with somebody,\" instead \"he’s being targeted for his political speech and that is something that cannot be tolerated in this country.\"\n\nSuri, as of Wednesday, was being held at a detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana. His attorneys on Thursday asked a federal court to compel the government to return him to Virginia, suggesting that he was rounded up on the basis of his speech on Palestinian rights and that that violated the due process clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“Dr. Suri’s experience is shocking and disgraceful,” said Suri’s immigration attorney, Hassan Ahmad. “It should worry everyone that masked government agents can disappear someone from their home and family because the current administration dislikes their opinion.”\n\nA judge ordered Suri not to be deported “unless and until” the court changes its position.\n\nAlawieh, a 34-year-old Lebanese citizen with a valid H-1B visa, was sent back to her homeland after she told customs agents at Boston Logan International Airport that she had attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader in Iran-back Hezbollah, the DHS said in a statement Monday.\n\nWhen asked if she supported Nasrallah, Alawieh said as a Shia Muslim she did but “from a religious perspective.”\n\n“A visa is a privilege not a right — glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” the agency responded later.\n\nIf Alawieh did attend the Nasrallah funeral, she had plenty of company. Tens of thousands of people gathered at the 48,000-capacity Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut.\n\nBut Alawieh, a kidney and transplant specialist who had been in the U.S. since 2018, was deported despite an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts that she should not be removed from the state without 48 hours’ notice to “give the Court time to consider the matter.”\n\n“We’re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the U.S. to see her patients, and we’re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,\" Alawieh's immigration lawyer, Stephanie Marzouk, told reporters Monday.\n\nRep. Gabe Amo, D-R.I., said his office has been working since Friday to “assess the facts surrounding Dr. Alawieh, including the apparent violation of a federal judge’s order.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alawieh’s colleagues at Brown’s division of nephrology in East Providence, Rhode Island, were trying to square the person they worked with with the DHS statement.\n\n“She’s a very nice person,” Dr. George Bayliss said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit “All I Want for Christmas Is You” from other songwriters.\n\nJudge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Carey’s request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.\n\nIn 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana — who goes by the stage name Vince Vance — and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey’s 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.\n\nTheir lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he was “disappointed” in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nFox said it is his experience that judges at this level “nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.”\n\nStone and Powers’ suit said their \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.”\n\n\"Merry Christmas\" album cover featuring Mariah Carey. Columbia / Sony\n\nThey said there was an “overwhelming likelihood” Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song — which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard’s Hot Country chart — and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.\n\nAfter hearing from two experts for each side, Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey’s song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs were substantially similar.\n\nRamírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs’ attorneys “made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.”\n\nShe said they must pay at least part of the defendant’s attorney fees.\n\nDefense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCarey’s Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for the past six years in a row — measuring the most popular songs each week — not just the holiday-themed ones — by airplay, sales, and streaming.\n\nCarey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement — though not one that’s gone to court — over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

        "content": "A Georgetown University graduate student from India who was taken into custody this week and targeted for deportation by the Trump administration never made any pro-Hamas or antisemitic comments, his lawyer said.\n\nImmigration agents detained Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow who teaches at Georgetown and has a visa, outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, on Monday night, his attorney has said. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Suri is “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.”\n\nSuri’s lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, denied Thursday that Suri ever made pro-Hamas or antisemitic statements.\n\nAhmad has objected to Suri’s detention as \"beyond contemptible.\"\n\nBadar Khan Suri. Courtesy Georgetown University\n\n“This is still the United States of America, and we don’t punish people, we don’t whisk them away and send them 1,000 miles away from their family, based on what they may have said, what they may have posted on social media or who they are related to,” Ahmad said.\n\nA federal judge in Virginia ordered Thursday that Suri not be removed from the United States unless ordered by the court.\n\nSophia Gregg, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, said the judge’s block on any deportation was “exactly what we were hoping for.”\n\n“We were very concerned for our client, especially when we learned that he was at a Louisiana staging facility, which is the last stop on the way to tarmac,” she said Thursday. “That was a big concern for us, that he would be summarily deported.”\n\nSuri was at the Alexandria Staging Facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, on Thursday, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website.\n\nAssistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Wednesday on X, “Suri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.”\n\nSuri has a wife who is a U.S. citizen and three children in Virginia. His wife’s father, Ahmed Yousef, who lives in Gaza, is a former adviser to now-deceased Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh — but he told The New York Times that he left the Hamas-led government of Gaza more than a decade ago and does not have a senior position with Hamas.\n\nYousef told the newspaper that Suri was not involved in any “political activism,” including on behalf of Hamas, the Times reported. Yousef has also publicly criticized Hamas’ decision to attack Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the newspaper reported.\n\nAhmad told NBC News that he has no information that Suri has been in regular contact with Yousef.\n\n“I’m only aware of one instance when my client had contact with his father-in-law, and that was to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage,” Ahmad said.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to deport two other people involved in protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia University.\n\nOne of them, Mahmoud Khalil, is a Columbia graduate student who is a legal permanent resident and is married to a U.S. citizen. The second is Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian woman who attended Columbia but overstayed her visa, officials said.\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking to deport Suri and Khalil under part of U.S. immigration law that allows it if a person “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nThe ACLU and others have called the administration's actions an attempt to punish people for expressing their constitutionally protected views about Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\n\"Political speech — however controversial some may find it — may never be the basis for punishment, including deportation,\" Mary Bauer, the executive director of ACLU of Virginia, said in a statement Thursday. \"We will not let this egregious, unprecedented, and illegal abuse of power go unchecked.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has defended attempts to deport Khalil by saying that “no one has a right to a student visa.” A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in his election campaign condemned student protests against Israel's military action in Gaza, which followed the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel. Some congressional Republicans have also criticized universities for what they called antisemitic behavior at protests.\n\nThe Justice Department in February announced what it called an antisemitism task force focused on college campuses. The Trump administration on March 7 also said it was canceling around $400 million in federal grants to Columbia.\n\nOn March 4, Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social, \"All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.\"\n\nSuri is a postdoctoral fellow at the Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown.\n\nThe director of that center, Nader Hashemi, told NBC Washington that he is shocked by Suri’s arrest and the attempt to deport him. Hashemi said that that Suri was not political or an activist, and that he was focused on his teaching and research.\n\n“I would never imagine in a million years to see a faculty member, a student who’s engaged in exercising their First Amendment rights would be picked up by the state and thrown into jail and then deported,” Hashemi told the station.\n\n“That’s what they do in Putin’s Russia. That’s what they do in Xi Jinping’s China,” he said. “That’s what they do in the Islamic Republic of Iran, not in the United States, at least until now.”",

        "title": "Democrats face demands to step up their opposition to Trump at fiery town halls",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "It isn’t just Republicans getting an earful at local town halls in the wake of President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s federal job and spending cuts.\n\nFrom Colorado to Maryland, Democrats, too, this week have faced fired-up crowds who want them to step up their fight against Trump. The anger has intensified since Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, prompting questions about whether party leaders are up to the task.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also distanced themselves from Schumer, dumping further criticism on his strategy during the funding fight.\n\nAt a town hall Wednesday evening just outside Denver, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., found himself on the receiving end of anger and criticism from voters for being too passive when it comes to battling Trump.\n\nOne attendee tore into Bennet for voting to confirm several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\n“None of this feels like you’re fighting for us, for Colorado, for our kids, for our grandkids,” an attendee told Bennet as the crowd cheered. “The words are great, but I’m really not seeing any action.”\n\nToward the beginning of the event — which Bennet held in Golden, alongside Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo. — attendees shouted for one full minute as Bennet attempted to calm the crowd.\n\n“Hey. Hey! We’re not going to do it this way,” Bennet yelled, before repeatedly shouting, “Stop it!”\n\nBennet was also pressed on whether Schumer should remain Senate Democratic leader. He referenced his call for then-President Joe Biden to step aside during the 2024 campaign.\n\n“In dodging your question, let me just say it’s important for people to know, you know, when it’s time to go,” Bennet said. “And I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we’re going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was also grilled on how Democrats would confront Trump and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“We need to say ‘hell no,’\" one attendee told the genteel Ivey at a town hall he hosted this week in Suitland, a suburb outside of Washington. “And thank you for being polite with us, but when it comes to fighting these fights, we need you to be a little bit less polite, a little bit more hell no, instead of a little bit no.”\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., called for new Democratic leadership in the Senate. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images file\n\nIn a separate exchange, another attendee repeatedly interrupted the two-term congressman as he tried to answer someone else’s question: “The House is on fire. It is not business as usual. … This is outrageous. … This is bulls---.”\n\nBut Ivey drew loud applause when he became the first Democratic member of Congress to call for Schumer to step down from his post as party leader.\n\n“I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he’s had a great, longstanding career. He’s done a lot of great things, but I’m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward,” Ivey said.\n\nIn Arizona on Monday, Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego appeared before a less hostile crowd, but faced pointed questions from attendees about how they would protect programs they rely on. Kelly encouraged them to make phone calls and go to the offices of Republican members of Congress.\n\n“You show up in front of their office, tell them how pissed off you are and how bad this is for our country and how there are people inside the house that you were trying to burn down,” Kelly said.\n\nA Democratic 'tea party' movement?\n\nThe town hall events underscored the increased pressure Democratic members of Congress are under from their base to use every tool possible to block Trump’s agenda, even as they are limited in their role as the minority party in Washington. The scenes mirror the events of 2009, which were directed simultaneously at the Democratic governing trifecta in Washington and at members of the Republican minority who were accused of being too passive in opposition.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats want their elected representatives to stick to their positions and hold the line against Trump, while 32% favor compromising with him. That’s a dramatic shift from Trump’s first term: An April 2017 NBC News poll found that 59% of Democrats favored compromising with Trump, while 33% said lawmakers should stick to their positions.\n\nThat’s also led some progressive activists to call for new leadership in Congress. It’s a matter several Democrats declined to directly address this week while offering criticism of Schumer.\n\nAt a town hall in Lowell, Massachusetts, this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer’s decision to allow the GOP funding bill to move through the Senate was “wrong,” but didn’t say whether he should remain the party’s leader.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dodged a question on Schumer’s future at a news conference in San Francisco, saying he doesn’t “opine on internal caucus politics.”\n\n“We’re going to have to do a lot better the next time a key issue like this comes up,” Schiff said.\n\nFor his part, Schumer canceled a planned book tour this week amid the backlash, citing security concerns. But he has continued to defend his funding strategy in TV interviews, saying that a government shutdown would have resulted in a worse outcome for federal workers and further empower Trump and Musk. And he’s brushed off calls to step down from his leadership position.\n\n“I’m the best leader for the Senate,” he said Tuesday on CBS Mornings.”\n\nFrustrations mount with lawmakers in both parties\n\nMeanwhile, few Republican lawmakers held town halls this week during the congressional recess after drawing angry and frustrated crowds of their own earlier this year. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised members against holding in-person town halls.\n\nOne who did though, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., faced heckles and boos Wednesday night in Laramie, Wyoming, as she tried to downplay concerns about Trump and Musk.\n\n“It’s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with federal government,” Hageman said, adding that the attendees’ “hysteria is just really over the top.”\n\nAnd not every Democrat who has held a town hall in recent days received an icy reception.\n\nAt a Wednesday town hall in Frederick, Maryland, Democratic Reps. April McClain Delaney and Jamie Raskin faced a largely friendly, energized crowd that cheered lines about protecting Medicaid and Social Security and stopping DOGE in the courts, as well as hints of impeaching Trump if Democrats retake the House in 2026. (Raskin is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and any impeachment push would start in his committee.)\n\nStill, several constituents told NBC News they were frustrated by a lack of “substance” at the town hall.\n\nJuliana Lufkin, 33, a self-employed resident of Hagerstown, said the lawmakers were “tooting their own horns” when she would’ve liked to hear a strategy for combating Trump.\n\n“I would’ve liked to hear the plan, instead of a little bit of tooting their own horns and saying the things they’re doing and the things that we can do. This is not the leadership that we all hope for,” Lufkin said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Deborah Pleva, the vice president of engagement for The Sports Bra, said that there are about eight steps to open a franchise location and that the bar is working with several prospective franchisees who are \"quite far along in the process.\" However, the bar isn't quite ready to announce any new locations yet.\n\n“There is a high level of interest in the brand, but we’re being very selective to be sure potential franchisees are aligned with our mission and 100% dedicated to women’s sports and fandom,” Pleva said.\n\nNBC News spoke to six business owners who opened women’s sports bars recently or plan to open them this year. All of them, including Huyck, mentioned The Sports Bra as part of their inspiration.\n\nJax Diener and Emme Eddy opened Watch Me! Sports Bar in Long Beach, Calif., in July. Courtesy Jax Diener\n\nJax Diener, 58, said that she reached out to Nguyen in 2022, shortly after The Sports Bra opened, and asked about franchising the business but that Nguyen said she wasn’t ready for that yet.\n\nDiener had dreamed of opening a sports bar for about 30 years by the time The Sports Bra opened. She said she would go to a sports bar in Marina del Rey, California, almost every Sunday for years to watch football.\n\n“I left every Sunday saying, ‘I want to open my own sports bar someday,’ because I don’t want to feel the way I just felt in here for hours, like we spent so much money and so much time in that bar every Sunday only to feel like we weren’t smart enough by the gentleman that were in the bar,” Diener said. “We weren’t strategic enough. We don’t understand. We don’t know what we’re talking about and just feeling like it wasn’t for us.”\n\nDiener said her dream of opening a bar wasn’t initially about women’s sports, even though she has long been a fan. Diener attended the first-ever WNBA game in June 1997 between the New York Liberty and the Los Angeles Sparks and was a Sparks season ticket holder for a decade. At first, she said, she just wanted an inclusive place where all people could watch sports “and feel just like anybody else watching sports on TV.”\n\nPatrons at Watch Me! Sports Bar in Long Beach, Calif. Courtesy Jax Diener\n\nThough Nguyen wasn’t ready to franchise back in 2022, Diener said she didn’t want to wait too long to open her dream bar, because she saw the surge in interest in women’s sports. She started the process of opening the bar and restaurant in September 2023 and aimed to open in time for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. She and her wife, Emme Eddy, opened Watch Me! in Long Beach, California, ahead of the opening ceremony in July — one day after they got their business license.\n\n“Of course, everybody said to me: ‘There’s no way you can open a restaurant in under a year. There’s no way you’ll make it happen,’” Diener recalled. “And I said, ‘Watch me!’ And we’ve proved ourselves and our name over and over and over.”\n\nFunding roadblocks and challenges\n\nThough interest in women’s sports continues to increase, all of the women’s sports bar owners who spoke to NBC News said they had to crowdfund or dig into their savings to start their businesses.\n\nDiener said she and her wife didn’t want to take out business loans, so they opened Watch Me! primarily using all of the funds they had saved for retirement. They raised about $27,000 through crowdfunding, but that wasn’t nearly enough, she said. Recently, she said, she has started applying for grants, and the bar is also diversifying its offerings — for example, by hosting trivia nights, “sip and paint” events and live music.\n\nMonica Brady and Rachel Glenn plan to open The Dub in Kansas City, Missouri, later this year. They signed a lease on a space for the bar in September, and they’ve been working with the city to get their final permits to begin construction, which Glenn said will take about three months.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "More than 30 pro-Palestinian activists have filed a civil rights lawsuit against UCLA, alleging the university “repeatedly and systemically” violated the civil rights of protesters during demonstrations at the campus encampment last year.\n\nPlaintiffs said they were deprived of “their rights to assemble, speak, learn, and organize freely and safely” and left with “life-altering injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder,” according to a news release about the lawsuit.\n\nStett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the University of California president’s office, said the office had been notified of the lawsuit and was “gathering additional information.”\n\nThe lawsuit, announced Thursday, was filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. It lists 35 plaintiffs — including students, faculty members and legal observers — who were on campus during the protests last year.\n\nIn addition to alleging that university officials violated the “civil rights of all pro-Palestinian protesters” and failed to \"address and prevent\" discrimination, the lawsuit names the Los Angeles Police Department, the California Highway Patrol and 20 individuals it calls a \"rioting mob\" as defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the law enforcement agencies used “excessive physical force” and unlawfully arrested protesters.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that on May 2, when more than 200 people were arrested at the encampment, police “shot powerful kinetic impact projectiles at peoples’ heads and faces.”\n\nA spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol said the agency is unable to comment because of pending litigation. The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe people the lawsuit describes as a rioting mob are defined as those who participated in a \"brutal, hours-long riot\" against the encampment. Many of them are identified in the complaint as Los Angeles residents but not members of the UCLA community.\n\nThe campus police chief resigned in May after he drew intense criticism over his response to the April 30 attack on the encampment, when videos taken at the scene showed counterprotesters beating people and hitting people with poles.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the counterprotesters “violently assaulted protesters\" by \"breaking their bones, sexually assaulting them\" and \"burning their eyes with chemical munitions.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs allege in the suit that “police and private security watched from just a few yards away as the attack raged for hours.\"\n\n\"It was immediately apparent that there was not a semblance of protection for the physical safety of the encampment members, and the mob had successfully transformed a peaceful, interfaith community space into a site of horror,\" the complaint says.\n\nPlaintiffs' personal testimony included in the lawsuit describes violence they say counterprotesters and police officers inflicted upon them.\n\nA student, Jack Kearns, said a member of the group hit him in the head with \"a large piece of wood,\" rendering him unconscious. Another student, Faraaz Qureshi, said he was hit with rubber bullets four times, causing a severe open fracture in his finger and contusions and abrasions on his chest and back.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks monetary damage for the physical and psychological injuries it said the protesters experienced.\n\nHolbrook said the university has instituted “system-wide reforms to promote safety and combat harassment and discrimination” on UC campuses.",

The molten rock was contained within the park and wasn’t threatening residential areas.\n\nThe 14th episode ended Thursday afternoon after 28 hours. During the last seven hours, lava fountains were up to 600 feet high, according to the USGS’ Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nIn the early afternoon, a webcam’s livestream showed vigorous, bright-red fountains but later only showed billowing smoke.\n\nThe volcano began its current eruption on Dec. 23. It has stopped and resumed more than a dozen times since. The shortest episode lasted 13 hours, while the longest lasted eight days.\n\nEach time, the volcano has sent lava shooting high into the sky from caldera vents, creating a dramatic sight for park visitors.\n\nLocal families on spring break were among those gathered at various overlooks in the national park, said park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane.\n\n“There is a lot of excitement in the air and visitors are gasping in amazement, smiling from ear to ear, and walking briskly or running from parking lots to viewpoints hoping to see” the lava activity before it waned, she said in an email shortly before the fountains ceased.\n\nThe eruption is the sixth recorded at Kilauea’s summit since 2020.\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park encompasses the summits of two of the world’s most active volcanoes: Kilauea and Mauna Loa. Kilauea also erupted in June and September 2024.\n\nThe park, on Hawaii’s Big Island, is about 200 miles south of Honolulu.",

        "title": "Trump signs executive order to dismantle the Education Department",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start dismantling the Education Department.\n\n\"It sounds strange, doesn’t it? Department of Education. We’re going to eliminate it,\" Trump said in the East Room of the White House at a ceremony where he was flanked by children seated at school desks. Before he signed the order, Trump turned to the children and asked, “Should I do this?”\n\nIntroducing McMahon, Trump said that “hopefully she will be our last secretary of education.” He vowed “to find something else for you, Linda.”\n\nCongressional approval would be needed to fully abolish the department. Trump said he hoped Democrats would vote in favor.\n\n“I hope they’re going to be voting for it,\" Trump said of congressional Democrats, \"because ultimately it may come before them.”\n\nImmediately after the signing, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said on X that he will “submit legislation” to accomplish Trump’s goal of shutting down the Education Department “as soon as possible.”\n\nCongress established the Education Department in 1979 during President Jimmy Carter’s administration, and any effort to abolish it would face major obstacles from Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate, where 60 votes are required to overcome filibusters and advance measures to final votes.\n\nThe House Education Committee’s top Democrat, Bobby Scott, of Virginia, called the executive order “reckless” and argued in a statement that it would put “low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, and rural students at risk.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday morning that the department would not be completely eliminated under the executive order, saying its “critical functions” would continue, including the enforcement of civil rights laws and oversight of student loans and Pell grants.\n\n\"The Department of Education will be much smaller than it is today,\" Leavitt said, adding that the order directed McMahon \"to greatly minimize the agency. So when it comes to student loans and Pell grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education.\"\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe executive order also will not affect department activities aimed at meeting the educational needs of students with disabilities or Title I funding, which goes to school districts with high proportions of students from low-income families, a senior administration official told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nThe text of the order was not immediately published after the White House signing ceremony, which several Republican state attorneys general and governors attended. Trump publicly acknowledged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others.\n\nPolling on eliminating the Education Department shows the move is broadly unpopular, large part because of opposition from Democrats and independents. A Quinnipiac University survey conducted March 6-10 found that 60% of registered voters opposed the plan, while 33% were in favor of it. Just 1% of Democrats are in favor of the move, while 98% oppose it. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\nAt her Senate confirmation hearing last month, McMahon acknowledged the need to coordinate with Congress to close the department.\n\n\"Certainly President Trump understands that we’ll be working with Congress,\" she said in response to a question from Cassidy. \"We’d like to do this right. We’d like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators could get on board with and our Congress could get on board with that would have a better-functioning Department of Education but certainly does require congressional action.\"\n\nWith Trump's executive order, however, it appears the administration to some extent is sidestepping lawmakers. McMahon said Tuesday on SiriusXM’s “The David Webb Show\" that as they \"wind down\" her department, administration officials want to ensure they are providing states with best practices and the tools they will need.\n\nIn her justification for eliminating the department, McMahon said: \"I think it’s important to note what the Department of Education does not do. The Department of Education doesn’t educate anyone. It doesn’t hire teachers. It doesn’t establish curriculum. It doesn’t hire school boards or superintendents. It really is to help provide funding so that the states themselves can help with their own programs. But that creativity and innovation has to come from the state level.”\n\nMcMahon and the administration have already taken steps in recent weeks to gut the department by cutting its workforce nearly in half.\n\nNBC News recently reported that state officials and lawmakers have said they are not prepared to take on the full responsibility of education policy, and Trump's latest order is likely to be met with more legal challenges.\n\nLabor and civil rights groups issued statements Wednesday blasting the administration for the move. National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the administration's actions \"will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections.\"\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson called the order \"unconstitutional,\" adding that \"the rule of law doesn’t seem to matter\" to Trump.\n\n\"Only Congress can establish or abolish an executive agency,\" Johnson said. \"Trump is not just seeking to shut down an agency, he is deliberately dismantling the basic functions of our democracy, one piece at a time. This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump.\"",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Kat Graham stars as a high-powered attorney who finds herself entangled in a deeply personal case in Tyler Perry’s new film, “Duplicity,” out on Prime Video.\n\nGraham, who had a breakout role in “The Vampire Diaries,” plays Marley Wells, a lawyer pursuing justice for her best friend’s husband, who was shot by a white police officer. There are, of course, dramatic twists and turns along the way.\n\nThe actress said she was immediately drawn to the project because of its real-world relevance. She told NBC News that losing her brother to gun violence a few years ago has deeply shaped her perspective on justice and the importance of addressing systemic violence.\n\n“When I got the script and realized that the character was seeking justice for an unarmed Black man who was shot by police, I felt an immediate connection,” she said. “I knew I had to be part of telling this story.”\n\nGraham, who added that she is “drawn to any and everything that Tyler Perry does,” said that she wants the film to ignite meaningful conversations about police violence and systemic injustice among audiences.\n\n“I hope people start looking at what’s happening in the news and asking the hard questions,” she said. “We’ve become desensitized to these stories, and that’s not normal.”\n\nGraham’s commitment to social justice goes beyond the screen. “Equal rights and human rights have been my focus,” she said. She’s worked with the United Nations since 2013, and serves as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, focusing on refugee rights and displacement crises. She has also collaborated with Rotary International to support global humanitarian efforts, including education and clean water initiatives.\n\n“I spend a good chunk of my life working to amplify the voices of marginalized communities,” she said. “Playing this character felt like a gift from God — it gave me the opportunity to be on the right side of history and to tell a story that matters.”\n\nIn 2020, Kat Graham produced “At Risk Youth,” a PSA for the Black Lives Matter movement directed by Darren Genet and inspired by the police killings of Laquan McDonald and Tamir Rice. Graham called the PSA’s message “more relevant now than ever,” urging continued justice and accountability.\n\n“Watching a movie is just the beginning,” she said. “Use your voice, support organizations that advocate for change, and don’t be afraid to have difficult conversations. If this film makes even one person more aware, then we’ve done our job.”\n\nAs Graham continues to seek out roles that align with her advocacy work, she remains committed to using her platform to elevate marginalized voices. “I always want to play characters who fight to win, who empower others,” she said. “This film is more than just a thriller — it’s a reminder that we have a responsibility to keep these conversations alive.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "LAS VEGAS — At the first stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour out West, two of the Democratic Party’s most unabashed progressive lawmakers had plenty to say about President Donald Trump. But they also had some strong words for their own party.\n\n“This isn’t just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple “Primary Chuck” chants — a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week. The move enraged the base and prompted some of Ocasio-Cortez’s House colleagues to encourage her to mount a primary challenge to Schumer, her fellow New Yorker, in 2028.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., greet the crowd during a rally at Craig Ranch Regional Park in North Las Vegas on Thursday. K.M. Cannon / Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS via Getty Images\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sanders — stars on the left who are channeling a fighting spirit at a time when Democrats say that’s what they want to see more of — are looking to turn the party’s anger into action and mobilize voters in the fight against Trump and his MAGA movement.\n\n“I think unfortunately, the conservatives are playing a really good game of chess, and now it’s time for the Dems to go ahead and step up to the plate and figure out how we’re going to go ahead and take our democracy back,” said Samantha Petras, a resident of Phoenix who attended the pair's second event of the day, in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez made a direct appeal Thursday to working-class voters — a populist message they hope will particularly resonate in a battleground state like Nevada, which is home to one of the largest hospitality workers unions in the country.\n\n“We have two very different Americas. In one of those Americas, the wealthiest people have never, ever, in the history of our country, had it so good. People on top are doing extraordinarily well today,” Sanders said, prompting boos from the crowd. “We have more income and wealth inequality in our country than we have ever had.”\n\nDemocrats plan to hold nearly 30 town hall events this week, while Republican lawmakers continue to largely stay away from in-person constituent events because of voter backlash over Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s sweeping cuts to the federal government. Democratic lawmakers, though, are also hearing an earful from constituents who want their elected officials to stand up to Trump more aggressively.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez expect more than 51,000 people to turn out for their events this week, which will also include stops in Denver and Greeley, Colo., and Tucson, according to Sanders’ office. Sanders, 83, launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour last month with a pair of events in Iowa and Nebraska in a bid to target Republican voters dissatisfied with Trump and Musk.\n\nSanders planned the events in districts narrowly won by Republicans in 2024 to pressure lawmakers to vote against any cuts to entitlement programs, housing, nutrition or education, his office said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez acknowledged that not everyone in the crowd may agree with all of her politics or may not have even voted in the last election, but she encouraged the crowd to unite around an agenda that puts working-class voters first.\n\n“We might all come from different places, but we share a lot of the same experiences. So to all those who came here today unsure of whether or not this is where you belong, I want to say that you do,” she said. “You do, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender, identity or status, no matter, even, if you disagree with me on a bunch of things. But if you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here, regardless of who they are, how they identify or where they come from — you are welcome here.”\n\nEven as Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders tried to broaden their appeal beyond the typical base, plenty of criticism was aimed squarely at Trump.\n\n“We will not accept an authoritarian form of society with a president who undermines the Constitution every day and is working aggressively to take away our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,” Sanders said. “No, we will not accept the society of massive economic inequalities where the very rich are becoming much richer while working families across the country struggle to put food on the table.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is struggling to find its footing amid historically low approval numbers and a voter base that wants its leaders to put up a fight against Trump’s agenda.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Democrats say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if it risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, compared with 32% who want them to make legislative compromises with Trump, according to NBC News’ most recent poll.\n\nThe polling mirrors backlash Democratic lawmakers have received at their own town hall events, where voters this week complained about the party’s “passive” response to Trump’s Cabinet picks, empowerment of Musk and cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nThe frustration among Democratic voters and lawmakers alike intensified last week after Schumer led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, even as House Democrats warned the measure would codify spending cuts Trump pushed for.\n\nOcasio-Cortez skewered Schumer last week for his support of the Republican-led funding measure, calling it a “betrayal” and suggesting it could weaken the “trust” between House and Senate Democrats.\n\nDemocratic voters, too, said they were dismayed by Schumer's approach.\n\n“We should have shut the government down,” 55-year-old Marc Borzcon of Chandler, Ariz. said on Thursday at the event in Tempe. “I have no doubt in my mind that that was the proper thing to do under the circumstances.”\n\nAfter hearing Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speak, Borzcon encouraged Democrats to \"fight a little lower.\"\n\n\"I think we've seen the other side continuously break the rules and thumb their nose at the rules. So at some point you got to say, 'Hey, we don't play by the rules either,'\" he said.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nThere is also speculation she could mount a run for president, though her team insists she isn’t thinking about her own political future at the moment.\n\nBut the crowd in Las Vegas certainly is: “AOC 2028” pins were being sold at a merchandise stand outside the venue.\n\nMelanie Zanona reported from Las Vegas, Nnamdi Egwuonwu from Tempe, Ariz., and Brennan Leach from Washington, D.C.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Local health officials said Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, bringing the total to nearly 600 killed since Israel shattered a truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.\n\nHours later, Hamas fired three rockets at Israel without causing casualties, in the first such attack since Israel broke the ceasefire Tuesday.\n\nZaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at the Gaza Health Ministry, said Israeli bombardments have killed at least 592 people in the past three days.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was again enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Palestinians were not being ordered to leave northern Gaza but can no longer enter, the military said, and are only allowed to move south on foot using the coastal road. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north during the ceasefire.\n\nEarly Friday, Israel’s Cabinet unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request to fire the head of the country’s Shin Bet internal security service. The late-night decision to sack Ronen Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nIt also could set the stage for a crisis over the country’s division of powers. Israel’s attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.\n\nA Palestinian man hugs the body of a baby killed by overnight Israeli airstrikes in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, on Thursday. Bashar Taleb / AFP - Getty Images\n\nIsraeli ground forces, meanwhile, are pushing into Gaza near the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah, the military said Thursday. The operations come a day after Israel moved to split Gaza in two by retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza’s north from south.\n\nThe military ordered Palestinians to evacuate an area in central Gaza near the city of Khan Younis, saying it would operate there in response to Thursday’s rocket fire from Hamas. The Palestinian militant group said it targeted Tel Aviv. One rocket was intercepted and two fell in open areas, according to the army.\n\nYemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels also launched two missiles at Israel, one early Thursday morning and another in the evening, the military said. Both were intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, according to the army, and no injuries were reported. Air raid sirens rang out and exploding interceptor rockets were heard in Jerusalem. There have been three such attacks since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the Houthis earlier this week.\n\nA ‘bloody night’ for hard-hit Gaza\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said overnight Israeli strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. The ministry’s records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe Indonesian Hospital said it received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near Gaza’s northern border, which was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated earlier in the war.\n\n“It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,” said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble. “The situation is catastrophic.”\n\nIsrael’s military said Thursday its airstrikes in Gaza had killed the head of Hamas’ internal security apparatus and two other militant commanders. Israel has said it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. A United Nations-backed group of human rights experts accused Israel last week of “disproportionate violence against women and children” during the war in Gaza.\n\nOne of the strikes early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family’s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village outside Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was in an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.\n\nThe strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.\n\nFuneral prayers are held over the bodies of victims brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Thursday. Abed Rahim Khatib / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n“Another tough night,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. “The house collapsed over the people’s heads.”\n\nWar in Gaza has no end in sight\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration reiterated its support for Israel, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.”\n\nIsrael, which cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive — and gives up control of the territory.\n\nHamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nHamas says it’s willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decadeslong occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.\n\nShin Bet chief’s dismissal deepens Israeli political turmoil\n\nNetanyahu said Sunday he would seek Bar’s dismissal, saying he had lost faith in his security chief.\n\nBut critics say the move is a power grab by Netanyahu against an independent-minded civil servant.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated across the country in recent days in support of Bar, including a mass gathering outside Netanyahu’s office late Thursday in the pouring rain.\n\nA Shin Bet report into the Oct. 7 attack acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said that policies by Netanyahu’s government created the conditions for the attack.\n\nNetanyahu is also upset that the Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and the Gulf state of Qatar. His office said Bar’s dismissal would take effect April 10 or before then if a replacement is found.\n\nBar did not attend the meeting but sent a letter to the Cabinet ahead of time protesting the firing.\n\nHe said the dismissal was meant to hinder the agency from further investigating the failures of Oct. 7 and undermining the investigation into whether Qatar influenced the prime minister’s office.\n\n“This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel,” Bar wrote.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, according to Israeli officials. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nThe war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.",

        "content": "MATTESON, Ill. — This is what bird flu looks like.\n\nThe coop is empty and cavernous, the air still heavy with the stench of chicken waste.\n\nOn the floor, wood chip bedding has soaked up most of the blood from the birds slaughtered to prevent further spread of infection.\n\nStray feathers litter the ground. A few remnants of beige eggshells crunch underfoot.\n\nThere used to be 3,000 hens on Kakadoodle Farm — scratching, pecking, following the farmworkers around. Creating a din so loud you could barely hear someone yell from the other end of the coop.\n\nNow there are none.\n\nMarty Thomas, a co-owner of Kakadoodle Farm, in a quarantined chicken coop on the farm. Jim Vondruska for NBC News\n\nIt’s a scene that keeps repeating itself, again and again, on poultry farms large and small across America.\n\nThe biggest avian influenza outbreak in U.S. history is taking a brutal toll. Birds are dying off — or they're slaughtered — by the thousands. Farms are suffering massive financial losses, compounded in some cases by federal funding cuts and freezes. The outbreak has driven retail egg prices to a record high last month of $5.90 a dozen on average, nearly double what they were a year earlier. They have reached $12 a dozen in some places.\n\nFor more on this story, watch NBC’s “Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nNo one else, human or animal, has come down with bird flu at Kakadoodle since the virus hit.\n\nBut a large part of the farm — “the dirty zone” — is now under quarantine. And it will be for months to come.\n\nAt first, they thought it was the cold.\n\nIt was early January, and temperatures in southern Illinois were plunging into the single digits; the water lines running to the farm’s three coops kept freezing over.\n\nSo when the workers told Kakadoodle Farm owner Marty Thomas about the birds, he first thought they must have frozen to death. About 30 were scattered across the floors of two coops.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Raphael Garcia, an analyst at the Department of Veterans Affairs who was abruptly fired last month amid President Donald Trump’s sweeping push to shrink the federal workforce, learned this week that he was being reinstated following court orders from two federal judges.\n\nBut that news did not end the professional limbo that has defined Garcia’s life for over a month. He is not actually back on the job. Instead, he has been placed on administrative leave while the Trump administration appeals rulings from those two judges.\n\nGarcia has received verbal reassurance that he’ll get back pay while he’s on leave, but the whiplash of Trump’s first 100 days in office has not exactly left him in a trusting state of mind. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” Garcia told NBC News in an interview this week, adding that he won’t know whether his salary has restarted until the end of the pay period in late March.\n\nGarcia is one of 24,000 probationary federal workers who have been on a career roller-coaster ride as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency attempts to reshape the federal bureaucracy. These workers have been unceremoniously fired and rehired, but some remain in the dark about what comes next.\n\nIn many cases, the rehired probationary workers — meaning people who have held their positions for less than two years — were immediately placed on administrative leave, a temporary suspension with pay intact. Meanwhile, civil servants still face the looming prospect of more rounds of firings in the months and years ahead.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t fully trust this administration and its appointees on whether or not I’ll get to go back to work,” said a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee who was fired, rehired and placed on leave. “I’ve been out of work for a full month.”\n\nIn an email notifying him that he had been temporarily reinstated, the FEMA employee was told he would get a call this week from his agency’s human capital department to discuss benefits and paperwork for getting him back on the job. But he said he hasn’t heard from anyone yet.\n\nThe employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal, said he has had no choice but to start looking for other jobs.\n\n“I’d rather continue my work for FEMA and the American people,” he said. But “if I pass on another opportunity, but then get terminated again in a couple weeks, it could make a bad situation even worse.”\n\nThe employee took a skeptical view of Trump’s political appointees. “They have already broken my confidence and trust. It’s hard to know where we go from here. … It’s so confusing and so chaotic.”\n\nIn interviews, federal employees said they had found that agencies subject to the judges’ orders were not communicating the latest developments to their workers in a uniform way. In some instances, reinstated probationary workers have received email notifications; in other instances, they’ve gotten phone calls from managers or supervisors.\n\nSarah Boim, a probationary employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was fired in February, said she had not received a reinstatement notice as of Thursday. She now finds herself in an employment Catch-22, wondering if her reinstatement notice was sent to a CDC email account she lost access to after she was fired.\n\n“We need transparency. We’re being lied to. It’s unacceptable,” she said.\n\nIn an interview, an employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said she believes the Trump administration intends to “honor this reinstatement” only for as long as its mass firing initiatives are blocked by federal judges.\n\n“It’s all just so clearly in bad faith,” said the CFPB employee, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of professional repercussions.\n\nThe federal government has acknowledged that some reinstated employees will confront various hurdles before they’re up and running at work. In court filings accompanying the Justice Department’s appeal of the reinstatement orders, federal officials argued that restoring “removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens” on various agencies, “cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.”\n\n“Specifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,” the director of human capital operations at the Environmental Protection Agency said in one such filing.\n\nGarcia, the Veterans Affairs employee, said he does not view any of these administrative tasks as burdens. He is eager to get back to his job and help his agency deal with the mounting workload that he said has been caused by staff cuts.\n\n“It definitely does not cause us turmoil to be reinstated,” Garcia said. “I loved what I did. I’m a disabled veteran and I know the struggles of transitioning out of the military.”\n\n\"The real turmoil was being initially terminated” and being unable “to serve my fellow veteran community,” he added.",

        "title": "New political spending signals Elon Musk's huge role in the GOP is still growing",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "After having sunk more than a quarter-billion dollars into the 2024 election and then taken a central role in President Donald Trump’s administration, billionaire Elon Musk is demonstrating that he’s not done with his efforts to reshape American politics.\n\nMusk, the public face of Trump’s attempts to take a chain saw to the federal bureaucracy, is a constant fixture on White House grounds and on his social media platform, X. Meanwhile, the super PAC he founded is the top outside spender in the April 1 election that will determine the majority on Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court, and he is also demonstrating his willingness to use his wallet to reward Trump loyalists in Congress — and, some fear, to punish others — as he closely watches the political landscape.\n\nIt all makes Musk a megadonor without much parallel in modern political history — someone who not only can fundamentally reshape a campaign with a single check but is also a prominent political figure in his own right, both as a business executive and as the de facto leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn short, Musk’s prominence, his virtually unlimited bank account and his penchant for controversy are poised to play a big role in upcoming elections — for both parties, in different ways.\n\nAmerica PAC — the super PAC Musk started during the last presidential election, which spent more than $261 million primarily on helping Trump — is the top outside spender in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, having spent about $6.6 million so far on ads and organizing. While the group’s fundraising isn’t public yet, Musk, whose net worth is north of $300 billion, was responsible for the vast majority of the money it raised last year.\n\nThe third-largest outside spender in that race is Building America’s Future, a Republican-aligned nonprofit group to which Musk has previously sent millions of dollars, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Building America’s Future has spent $4.5 million so far in the race, Wisconsin campaign finance documents show, though it’s unclear whether Musk has any current involvement in the effort.\n\nStill, Musk’s past donations and prominent political role have made him a boogeyman in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. A recent ad for Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate running against Republican-backed Judge Brad Schimel, claims that “Elon Musk is trying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors.” It’s the first time Musk has appeared in a TV ad in Wisconsin, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending and content, following repeated Democratic mentions of Musk on the trail and in digital ads.\n\nMusk has also been rewarding members of Congress who have expressed support for impeaching judges who issued rulings against elements of Trump’s agenda. A person familiar with Musk’s donations confirmed to NBC News that he gave $6,600 apiece, the maximum campaign donations under federal law, to Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., and Brandon Gill, R-Texas, as well as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. (Only Van Orden is expected to be running in a competitive race next year.)\n\nThose donations, first reported by The New York Times, were made after the president and his allies railed against a ruling Saturday from Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Boasberg ordered the administration to return flights to El Salvador deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members and return them to the United States. The administration didn’t do so.\n\nTrump has called for Boasberg’s impeachment, while Musk has spent days posting on X in support of efforts to remove judges he perceives to be anti-Trump.\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said Musk’s direct contributions are “obviously always appreciated” but are “basically marginal in races like that,” especially when those direct contributions are capped at such a low level, unlike super PAC donations that Musk can make with no limits.\n\nBut it’s “definitely beneficial for [Musk] to be involved though,” the aide wrote, adding that Musk was “a huge help in PA and a few other states for us last cycle.”\n\nWhile a handful of $6,600 donations are basically nothing to the world’s richest man, they still send a loud message: He’s watching what congressional Republicans do very closely. And though Musk has focused most of his spending so far on general elections, the notion that he could bankroll an insurgent Republican in a primary race looms large.\n\nMusk said in November that America PAC’s future included playing a “significant role in primaries” and implied that there’s “no other way” to “drain the swamp” besides funding primary challenges against Republicans who don’t back Trump’s agenda. The warnings aren’t lost on Republicans, including the small sliver who aren’t in lockstep behind Trump.\n\nAt a media availability event this week at the Alaska Legislature, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a critic of some of DOGE’s cuts, lamented that other Republicans may see some of the criticism she has faced from within the party and decide to be “zip-lipped, not saying a word, because they’re afraid they’re going to be taken down, they’re going to be primaried.”\n\n“It may be that Elon Musk has decided he’s going to take the next billion dollars he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,” she added. “And you know what? That may happen, but I’m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans.”\n\nMusk the donor for GOP ads, Musk the character for Democratic ads\n\nMusk didn’t just bankroll America PAC like an ordinary megadonor last year— he barnstormed swing states on Trump’s behalf, appearing at events held by his group and at rallies alongside Trump as he made the case for the future president. And as he continues to engage on social media and with his political spending, it seems likely he will remain active.\n\nA Trump ally said Musk’s cash would be a huge boost in the 2026 midterm elections — while noting the GOP could face the typical midterm headwinds, something a check alone wouldn’t be able to fix.\n\n“I think any money is good money to put into these races,” this person said. “And it will matter. But what matters more is the environment. If the environment is good, they will need less money. If it’s bad, they will need more.\n\n“We are in an environment where Republicans have become less reliable voters than Democrats,” this person continued, adding: “We need to change the composition of the electorate. That’s a much harder task than straight persuasion. And it is a rarity in politics, certainly something that we have not done in decades without Donald Trump on the ballot.”\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will have an opportunity, they believe, to use Musk and DOGE’s cuts against the Republican Party — and to use Musk as a proxy, as in the new TV ad airing in Wisconsin.\n\nThe new NBC News poll found that 39% of registered voters view Musk positively and 51% view him negatively, making his public image worse than both Trump’s and Vice President JD Vance’s. (He’s also far less popular than federal workers, according to the survey.)\n\nVoters are split on DOGE in new NBC News polling, with 46% saying it’s a good idea, 40% saying it’s a bad idea and 14% unsure. But 41% view DOGE positively, and 47% view it negatively. And while a third want DOGE to continue as is, the remaining share of the electorate either want DOGE to slow down or think it’s reckless.\n\nSome of that frustration has fueled criticism at Republican lawmakers’ town halls in recent weeks, energy Democrats believe they can harness.\n\nVoteVets, a progressive veterans group, announced this week it’s launching a six-figure ad campaign criticizing five vulnerable House Republicans with messaging that focuses on Musk and DOGE alone, with no mention of Trump.\n\n“If Republicans are not going to speak out against Elon Musk buying access to fire middle-class veterans, they’re going to be held accountable to it in the midterms,” said Matt Corridoni, the vice president of communications at VoteVets.\n\nHouse Majority Forward, a super PAC that supports the House Democrats’ political agenda, launched ads and billboards featuring Musk, too, using him as a face of the GOP budget resolution, which Democrats warn could lead to Medicaid cuts. Last month, the group put out messaging guidance telling Democrats: “On Elon Musk, it is important to focus on how his conflicts of interest as head of DOGE could lead to cuts to Medicare and Social Security and leave the interests of the middle class behind.”\n\nAnd Musk is a fixture in Democratic fundraising ads — lawmakers like Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Reps. Sean Casten, D-Ill., Robert Garcia, D-Calif., Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., are among those who have launched digital fundraising appeals evoking Musk in recent weeks, according to AdImpact.\n\n“You’re using him as a foil to explain what Republicans are doing — they’re laying off people, they’re cutting Medicaid benefits, X and Y and Z, and then they are profiting off of that,” said a Democratic strategist involved in House races, explaining the emphasis on Musk. “You can use Musk as a boogeyman, but you have to relay it back to real-life things that are happening.”\n\nAnother Democratic strategist at a group that’s attacking Musk told NBC News that attacking him serves multiple purposes, both electoral and personal.\n\nIt’s a way to highlight Trump’s “policies that are actively harming people,” the strategist said, “and also get under his skin, reminding him he’s not the center of his own show.”\n\n“If we get into a mud fight over whether people like Donald Trump, we’ve been shown time and time again that we lose that,” the strategist said.\n\nBut, this person added, “if we show people how these policies are hurting them and we make Trump feel less secure, we win on two planes.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Turkey’s government warned on Friday against “illegal” calls from the main opposition for street protests over the detention of Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, after thousands demonstrated across the country in the last two days.\n\nInterior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 53 people were detained and 16 police officers were injured in protests that began at university campuses, Istanbul municipal headquarters and elsewhere on Thursday, triggering scattered clashes.\n\nImamoglu, who is President Tayyip Erdogan’s main political rival and leads him in some polls, was detained on Wednesday facing charges including graft and aiding a terrorist group.\n\nThe mayor’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) has condemned the move as politically-motivated and urged people to lawfully demonstrate, while European leaders have criticised the detention as democratic backsliding.\n\nYerlikaya and the justice minister, Yilmaz Tunc, criticised the calls for action from CHP leader Ozgur Ozel as “irresponsible” amid a four-day ban on public gatherings.\n\n“Gathering and marching in protest are fundamental rights. But calling to the streets over an ongoing legal investigation is illegal and unacceptable,” Tunc said on X early on Friday.\n\nTunc said the courtroom was the place to respond to any legal process and called for calm, adding that the “independent and unbiased judiciary” was evaluating the case. He has warned against linking Erdogan to Imamoglu’s arrest.\n\nDemonstrations took place Thursday in Ankara, Izmir and Istanbul, as well as other provinces across the country, with police erecting barricades on several main streets.\n\n‘Theatrics’\n\nErdogan dismissed the opposition’s criticism as “theatrics” and “slogans” that distract from its internal mistakes.\n\nSpeaking at the main Istanbul rally late Thursday, the CHP’s Ozel responded: “Hey Erdogan, you’re most scared of the streets. We are now on the streets, in squares. Continue to be afraid.”\n\n“While you keep the one we elected in custody, we will not sit at home,” he said before thousands of supporters.\n\nMayor Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul in 2024. Yasin Akgul / AFP via Getty Images file\n\n“Mr. Tayyip, you are scared and you are asking, ‘are you calling people to the streets? Are you calling people to the squares?’ Yes. I didn’t fill up these squares or these streets, you did.”\n\nSince Imamoglu’s detention, many supporters had called for more concrete and organised action from the CHP, making Ozel’s call a significant escalation of pressure on the government.\n\nThe move against Imamoglu, 54, a two-term mayor, comes as the CHP was set to announce him as its presidential candidate on Sunday. It has called for non-party members to vote for him in ballot boxes set up across the country, as a sign of public resistance.\n\nNo presidential election is scheduled until 2028 but Erdogan, 71, could call it early to avoid hitting a two-term limit if he decides to run again.\n\nCrackdown\n\nImamoglu’s detention caps a months-long legal crackdown on opposition figures that has been criticised as an attempt to hurt their electoral prospects and silence dissent, charges the government denies.\n\nAnkara has dramatically curbed civil disobedience since the 2013 nationwide Gezi Park protests against Erdogan’s government prompted a violent state crackdown.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Ozel told Reuters his party would resist but not disrupt public order.\n\nHe vowed to resist any potential attempts by authorities to remove him and CHP officials from the municipality headquarters, where they have been staying since Imamoglu’s detention. The party would resist any unjust replacement of Imamoglu, he said.\n\nA government appointee could replace the mayor if he is formally arrested in coming days as part of the probe charging him with aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), deemed a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its Western allies.\n\nHis detention came a day after a university annulled his degree, which if upheld would block him from running for president under constitutional rules that require candidates to have a four-year degree.",

        "title": "Israel threatens 'permanent' control of Gaza areas unless Hamas releases hostages",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Israel ordered its troops to permanently seize parts of the Gaza Strip — to be “annexed to Israel” — unless Hamas hands over the remaining hostages, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Friday.\n\nThe statement came after Israel this week broke the two-month ceasefire with Hamas, with the resumption of airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza killing nearly 600 people.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to intensify those operations until the militant group, which nominally controlled Gaza before this round of conflict, returns the 59 dead and living hostages who it continues to hold captive.\n\n“I have instructed the IDF to seize additional areas in Gaza, while evacuating the population, and to expand the security zones around Gaza for the protection of Israeli communities and IDF soldiers,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel.”\n\nIsraeli soldiers look out from a tank toward destroyed buildings in northern Gaza on Tuesday. Amir Levy / Getty Images\n\nKatz also threatened the use of “all military and civilian pressure tools including the evacuation of Gaza’s population southward and the implementation of voluntary relocation plans for Gaza residents,” while describing the new more expansive phase of Israel's military offensive in the enclave.\n\nHe added that this would be done \"through permanent Israeli control of the territory.\"\n\nHamas said Friday that it \"remains at the heart of the negotiations,\" and was engaging with mediators including \"discussing the Witkoff proposal and the various ideas on the table.\"\n\nThe group said in a statement that its aim is \"achieving a prisoner exchange deal that secures the release of prisoners, ends the war, and achieves withdrawal.\"\n\nSince signing the ceasefire in January, Netanyahu has faced the twin pressures of hostage families urging him to facilitate their return, and his hard-right coalition members threatening to collapse his government unless he restarts the war. On Tuesday, his military opted for the latter, launching strikes into Gaza that he and the White House blamed on Hamas’ refusal to release more hostages.\n\nBut Netanyahu's accusations do not reflect the structure of the deal.\n\nIn the first phase of the truce, Israel exchanged 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees for the return of 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight more of the roughly 250 who were taken captive during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israel.\n\nNearly 49,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave, according to local health officials, whose figures the World Health Organization has said in the past are reputable.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire ended March 1 and was meant to precede a second phase 16 days later involving the exchange of all remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire.\n\nThat never happened, with Netanyahu agreeing to a proposal tabled by White House envoy Steven Witkoff to extend the ceasefire by 50 days in order to discuss phase two. This was immediately rejected by Hamas, but Katz said Friday that Israel was still standing by it.\n\nThe White House has made it clear it stands with Israel’s decision but has yet to respond to NBC News' request for comment on Katz's remarks Friday.\n\n“The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.\n\nThis is a developing story.

All had come to watch him sign an executive order to gut the Education Department, something conservatives have dreamed of doing for decades. No other president had done it, not even this one the first time he was in office.\n\nNow he was back, and there was the order, sitting atop a small desk at the front of that grandiose room, waiting to be signed.\n\nAll around his desk were lots of other little desks, the kind you sit at in grade school. Children of varying ages, dressed in school uniforms, sat swinging their legs under their desks. They looked up expectantly as Mr. Trump approached.\n\nHe turned to one small boy and said, “Should I do this?” The boy nodded eagerly. The president spun around and looked at a young girl. “Should I do it?” he asked. She nodded, too.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "A hearing has been set for Friday afternoon to debate whether a federal judge in Washington acted correctly when he temporarily stopped the Trump administration last weekend from summarily deporting scores of Venezuelan immigrants under a powerful but rarely invoked wartime statute.\n\nThe hearing, scheduled for 2:30 p.m. in Federal District Court in Washington, could also include some discussion about the Justice Department’s repeated recalcitrance in responding to the judge’s demands. He has been requesting information about two deportation flights in particular, which officials say carried members of a Venezuelan street gang, Tren de Aragua, to El Salvador.\n\nThe judge, James E. Boasberg, scolded the department in a stern order on Thursday for having “evaded its obligations” to provide him with data about the flights. He wants that information as he seeks to determine whether the Trump administration violated his initial instructions to turn the planes around after they left the United States on Saturday evening.\n\nMost of the courtroom conversation, however, is likely to concern Judge Boasberg’s underlying decision to stop the White House for now from using the wartime law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, to pursue its immigration agenda. The statute, passed in 1798, gives the government expansive powers during an invasion or a declared war to round up and summarily remove any subjects of a “hostile nation” over the age of 14 as “alien enemies.”",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "The Season 2 finale is long, running over an hour and 20 minutes. But it has strong momentum, thanks to that Cold Harbor deadline. For his part, Mark needs to complete the file (which he does … hence the marching band) to set the escape plan in motion. When Lumon moves Gemma to a new location in the office building, Mark should be able to get to her.\n\nThe “Severance” creative team and cast have a lot of fun weaving sci-fi elements into what is essentially, in this episode, a heist thriller. When Mark finds Gemma and tries to rush her out of the building, both of them struggle with the general weirdness of Lumon and with the way their consciousness shifts depending on which floor they’re on. Sometimes they’re innies; sometimes they’re outies. (And on at least one floor there is a sacrificial goat with verve, provided by Lumon’s “Mammalians Nurturable” department. That is “Severance” for you.)\n\nThe heist is a success. Mark gets Gemma out of one of Lumon’s exit doors, where she reverts to her outie self. But then Gemma watches in horror as Mark, on the other side of that door — and still an innie — chooses to leave her and run back to Helly. The season ends with Mark and Helly together in a freeze frame, as Mel Tormé sings “The Windmills of Your Mind.” It’s like a moment ripped from one of those hip, stylish, ennui-laden 1960s movies.\n\nIt also brings us back to that conversation from earlier in the episode, forces us to ask a question: Which Mark are we really rooting for? This is a show about how corporations can treat people like cogs; and it is also a show that suggests these cogs have a right to their own personalities, feelings and interests.\n\nBut this is left unresolved at the end of Season 2: What are Mark and Helly running toward? As they head deeper into the machine that dehumanizes them, perhaps they are content to know that at least they are making their own choice — outies be damned.",

        "content": "Some travelers were headed to a wedding, some to a funeral. Others were leaving for a vacation in Iceland, taking a business trip to Britain or returning home from a honeymoon in Italy.\n\nBut on Friday, tens of thousands of passengers in Europe and beyond were stranded hundreds of miles from their destinations as a power outage at London Heathrow, the main airport serving the British capital, caused major disruptions to air travel.\n\n“We are stuck,” said James Porritt, who was supposed to leave early Friday for Australia until his flight was canceled. Mr. Porritt said that he and his wife, who were staying at a hotel at Heathrow, were not going to be able to leave until Sunday.\n\n“She is up in the room worrying,” he said of his wife. “She has been crying from stress.”\n\nPassengers at the second-largest airport serving London, Gatwick, which received many flights that had been headed to Heathrow, stood in line at help desks, sat on the ground or frantically refreshed airline websites.\n\n“This place is a mess,” said Patricia Bradley, 69, noting that she had lined up in “about six different places.”\n\nThe scene at Gatwick was in stark contrast to the eerie quiet at Heathrow, usually one of the world’s busiest airports. The drop-off zone at Terminal 3 was deserted; runways and airline counters were empty.\n\nDenyse Kumbuka, a teacher who had been trying to get home to Dallas, said that she might have to try to sleep in the terminal because she could not afford a hotel. “I don’t have a choice,” she said.\n\nThe power outage, caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Heathrow, forced the authorities to close the airport for all of Friday. They warned that flight disruptions could last for days.\n\nA glance at Heathrow’s flight information board on Friday morning gave a sense of just how big the shock waves from the closure would be. Flights from Brunei, India and Vietnam were scheduled to land, and passengers had been expecting to board planes taking them to dozens of destinations: Miami, Singapore, Tokyo… the list went on.\n\n“I am extremely frustrated,” Tori Allen, 31, who was supposed to leave London for a birthday trip to Iceland on Friday night, said, adding, “It’s all quite chaotic.” She had not heard anything from her airline, she said, but she went ahead and booked new tickets for Saturday morning, for double the price.\n\nTravelers took to social media to complain about the disruption and ask the airlines for help. One wrote that she could no longer run the half-marathon she had prepared for, another that he had had to pull out of a Pokémon Go championship.\n\nIn the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Lukas Zou was among the travelers waiting for news about a flight to London. Mr. Zou, who works at a trading firm, said that he had learned of the Heathrow shutdown just as he was about to board his Shenzhen Airlines plane, scheduled to depart at 1:45 p.m. local time.\n\n“With so much luggage, I don’t know if I should laugh or cry. I’ve already booked a hotel room in London, and it can’t be canceled,” Mr. Zou said.\n\nDozens of airlines fly to Heathrow from about 180 places worldwide. Many planes already in the air were forced to divert elsewhere. Kennedy Airport in New York had the most flights scheduled to arrive at Heathrow on Friday. Some of the more than 20 flights that were supposed to arrive from Kennedy were diverted to Manchester, in northwestern England; to Glasgow; or to Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nAs many as 290,000 passengers traveling in or out of Heathrow could be affected by the closure, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. On Friday, 669 flights were scheduled to take off from Heathrow, Cirium said.\n\nHeathrow is the main hub for British Airways, which said that it was redirecting flights to other airports in Britain, where possible.\n\nAt Fiumicino Airport in Rome, dozens stood in line at the British Airways counter. The airport’s information board showed that four British Airways flights were canceled on Friday morning.\n\nA group of high school students from Arizona, planning to fly home via Heathrow after a week in Italy, arrived at Fiumicino to disappointment. “We didn’t find out the flight was canceled until half of our party had checked in,” said Angel Brady, a chaperone on the trip. She said that the group would miss its connecting flight to Phoenix.\n\nNorth American, Asian and Australian airlines were also affected. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Air Canada and JetBlue were among those having to divert their Heathrow-bound jets or return them to the airports they had come from.\n\nNicholas Yong contributed reporting from Singapore, Jonathan Wolfe and Lynsey Chutel from London and Matthew Mpoke Bigg from Rome.",

        "content": "For Norbert Röttgen, a member of Parliament for the center-right Christian Democrats, the rupture with Washington is already profound, with consequences both urgent and far-reaching. “This is the end of the European peace order,” he noted.\n\n“We’ve come to the conclusion that we have to do European security on our own,” Mr. Röttgen said, “and it’s an emergency, because we have war in Europe.”\n\nEuropeans are in different stages of adaptation to what they fear is the loss of their American ally. “The initial shock has given way to a sense of mobilization,” said Thomas Bagger, a top official at the German Foreign Ministry.\n\n“It was a sudden feeling of being on our own, a bit orphaned,” he said. “But now there’s a bit more of a self-confident line. There is an understanding that Europe is now what’s left of the West, and that’s especially important for Germany.”\n\nThe sense of betrayal by Washington is perhaps strongest among Germans who grew up in the first decades after World War II. “There’s no other country in Europe that is as much a product of enlightened postwar American policy as Germany,” said Mr. Bagger, born in 1965. “So the shock is deeper here.”",

Mr. Porritt said that he and his wife, who were staying at a hotel at Heathrow, were not going to be able to leave until Sunday.\n\n“She is up in the room worrying,” he said of his wife. “She has been crying from stress.”\n\nPassengers at the second-largest airport serving London, Gatwick, which received many flights that had been headed to Heathrow, stood in line at help desks, sat on the ground or frantically refreshed airline websites.\n\n“This place is a mess,” said Patricia Bradley, 69, noting that she had lined up in “about six different places.”\n\nThe scene at Gatwick was in stark contrast to the eerie quiet at Heathrow, usually one of the world’s busiest airports.

In collaboration with the Upshot, we sent a survey to hundreds of literary luminaries, asking them to name the 10 best books published since Jan. 1, 2000.\n\nStephen King took part. So did Bonnie Garmus, Claudia Rankine, James Patterson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Elin Hilderbrand, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Sarah MacLean, Min Jin Lee, Jonathan Lethem and Jenna Bush Hager, to name just a few. And you can also take part! Vote here and let us know what your top 10 books of the century are.\n\nWe hope you’ll discover a book you’ve always meant to read, or encounter a beloved favorite you’d like to pick up again. Above all, we hope you’re as inspired and dazzled as we are by the breadth of subjects, voices, opinions, experiences and imagination represented here.\n\nMy Tally I haven’t read any of these books yet ... If you’ve read a book on the list, be sure to check the box under its entry, and your final count will appear here. (We’ll save your progress.) ... but I’m sure there’s something for me.

Videos shared by Russian military bloggers and verified by The New York Times showed a large fire at the station, which once pumped gas to Europe through Ukraine, with what appeared to be pipelines engulfed in flames.\n\nAlso on Friday, Russian authorities in the southwestern Krasnodar region reported a secondary explosion at a fuel depot that had been burning for two days after a Ukrainian drone attack. Russian officials said the fire had spread to more than 100,000 square feet.\n\nKyiv and Moscow agreed this week to a limited 30-day cease-fire on strikes against energy infrastructure — the first major step toward de-escalation in more than three years of war. The agreement followed calls between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, to broker the partial cease-fire.",

But about six months ago, Sudan’s military began a major counteroffensive, at first seizing strategic bridges on the Nile, later taking large swathes of territory.\n\nThe military recaptured the presidential palace early Friday in Khartoum, signaling a potential turning point in the conflict.\n\nAlthough both sides blame each other for starting the war, they have a shared responsibility.

        "content": "Follow live updates on the Trump administration here.\n\nBuried in China’s latest government budget were some numbers that add up to an alarming trend. Tax revenue is dropping.\n\nThe decline means that China’s national government has less money to address the country’s serious economic challenges, including a housing market crash and the near bankruptcy of hundreds of local governments.\n\nWeak tax revenue also puts China’s leaders in a box as they square off with President Trump, who has imposed 20 percent tariffs on goods from China and threatened more to come. Beijing has less spare cash to help the export industries that are driving economic growth but could be hurt by tariffs.\n\nThe drop in tax collections leaves China’s leaders in an unfamiliar position. Until the last several years, China enjoyed robust revenue, which it used to invest in infrastructure, a rapid military buildup and extensive industrial subsidies. Even as economic growth has slowed gradually over the past 12 years, taking a dent out of consumer spending, tax revenue held fairly steady until recently.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Some travelers were headed to a wedding, some to a funeral. Others were leaving for a vacation in Iceland, taking a business trip to Britain or returning home from a honeymoon in Italy.\n\nBut on Friday, tens of thousands of passengers in Europe and beyond were stranded hundreds of miles from their destinations as a power outage at London Heathrow, the main airport serving the British capital, caused major disruptions to air travel.\n\n“We are stuck,” said James Porritt, who was supposed to leave early Friday for Australia until his flight was canceled. Mr. Porritt said that he and his wife, who were staying at a hotel at Heathrow, were not going to be able to leave until Sunday.\n\n“She is up in the room worrying,” he said of his wife. “She has been crying from stress.”\n\nPassengers at the second-largest airport serving London, Gatwick, which received many flights that had been headed to Heathrow, stood in line at help desks, sat on the ground or frantically refreshed airline websites.\n\n“This place is a mess,” said Patricia Bradley, 69, noting that she had lined up in “about six different places.”\n\nThe scene at Gatwick was in stark contrast to the eerie quiet at Heathrow, usually one of the world’s busiest airports. The drop-off zone at Terminal 3 was deserted; runways and airline counters were empty.\n\nDenyse Kumbuka, a teacher who had been trying to get home to Dallas, said that she might have to try to sleep in the terminal because she could not afford a hotel. “I don’t have a choice,” she said.\n\nThe power outage, caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Heathrow, forced the authorities to close the airport for all of Friday. They warned that flight disruptions could last for days.\n\nA glance at Heathrow’s flight information board on Friday morning gave a sense of just how big the shock waves from the closure would be. Flights from Brunei, India and Vietnam were scheduled to land, and passengers had been expecting to board planes taking them to dozens of destinations: Miami, Singapore, Tokyo… the list went on.\n\n“I am extremely frustrated,” Tori Allen, 31, who was supposed to leave London for a birthday trip to Iceland on Friday night, said, adding, “It’s all quite chaotic.” She had not heard anything from her airline, she said, but she went ahead and booked new tickets for Saturday morning, for double the price.\n\nTravelers took to social media to complain about the disruption and ask the airlines for help. One wrote that she could no longer run the half-marathon she had prepared for, another that he had had to pull out of a Pokémon Go championship.\n\nIn the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Lukas Zou was among the travelers waiting for news about a flight to London. Mr. Zou, who works at a trading firm, said that he had learned of the Heathrow shutdown just as he was about to board his Shenzhen Airlines plane, scheduled to depart at 1:45 p.m. local time.\n\n“With so much luggage, I don’t know if I should laugh or cry. I’ve already booked a hotel room in London, and it can’t be canceled,” Mr. Zou said.\n\nDozens of airlines fly to Heathrow from about 180 places worldwide. Many planes already in the air were forced to divert elsewhere. Kennedy Airport in New York had the most flights scheduled to arrive at Heathrow on Friday. Some of the more than 20 flights that were supposed to arrive from Kennedy were diverted to Manchester, in northwestern England; to Glasgow; or to Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nAs many as 290,000 passengers traveling in or out of Heathrow could be affected by the closure, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. On Friday, 669 flights were scheduled to take off from Heathrow, Cirium said.\n\nHeathrow is the main hub for British Airways, which said that it was redirecting flights to other airports in Britain, where possible.\n\nAt Fiumicino Airport in Rome, dozens stood in line at the British Airways counter. The airport’s information board showed that four British Airways flights were canceled on Friday morning.\n\nA group of high school students from Arizona, planning to fly home via Heathrow after a week in Italy, arrived at Fiumicino to disappointment. “We didn’t find out the flight was canceled until half of our party had checked in,” said Angel Brady, a chaperone on the trip. She said that the group would miss its connecting flight to Phoenix.\n\nNorth American, Asian and Australian airlines were also affected. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Air Canada and JetBlue were among those having to divert their Heathrow-bound jets or return them to the airports they had come from.\n\nNicholas Yong contributed reporting from Singapore, Jonathan Wolfe and Lynsey Chutel from London and Matthew Mpoke Bigg from Rome.",

But he said the scientist’s case was “extraordinarily atypical” and a “subject of concern.”\n\nThat concern was shared by the French Academy of Sciences, which said in a statement on Thursday that the scientist’s deportation “seriously undermines the fundamental freedoms of the academic world: freedom of thought, expression and travel.”\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington D.C., and Ségolène Le Stradic from Paris.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The most exciting player this year is ...\n\nPJ Haggerty, a 6ft 3in redshirt sophomore guard, is already on his third college team, Memphis, after brief stints at Tulsa and TCU. Haggerty was third in Division I in scoring this year, averaging 21.8 points per game, and he scored 83 points in three games to boost the No 5-seeded Tigers to the American Athletic Conference title. DC\n\nThis is like asking me to pick my favorite child, which is easy because I only have one. After having seen her play in person a few times, I have to go with Notre Dame’s Hannah Hidalgo. Her game is magnetic. She’s quick on her feet, aggressive and has no problem getting in anyone’s face – it’s fun, exciting, and the kind of basketball I love to see. SK\n\nWe’ve already dicussed Cooper Flagg in detail elsewhere, so I’ll go with Jase Richardson from Michigan State. The 6ft 3in freshman point guard has an elite shooting touch and is incredibly efficient, with a 59% effective field goal percentage. Richardson embodies the toughness and grit that Tom Izzo values, and he has the potential to lead the Spartans on a deep run. NL\n\nPaige Bueckers is excellent but she and her UConn teammates are complemented by the addition of Azzi Fudd. After missing pivotal moments through injury – like last year’s Final Four matchup, where her ample shooting range was needed most – Fudd has been one of the comeback players of the year. She was the key factor in UConn’s upset of South Carolina, breaking the Gamecocks’ 71-game home win streak. I’m excited to see how her confidence, quick release, and three-pointers will impact the Huskies. TR\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to, on or off the court?\n\nThe final television ratings. Fueled by that phenomenon named Caitlin Elizabeth Clark, the women’s final outdrew the men’s final on TV for the first time last year – and by more than 4m viewers. Can the women make it two in a row? Three of the last four men’s finals have been blowouts, decided by 15 points or more. DC\n\nOn the court: assuming they can take out South Florida and Ohio State (they can!), Tennessee v Texas will be one of the banner games to watch in the women’s tournament. When they last met in January, Texas eked out a win by only four points, and Tennessee will be hungry to make a major March impact this year. SK\n\nThe potential Rick Pitino v John Calipari matchup. There is a lot of history here. They started as good friends, with Pitino helping Calipari land his first head coaching job at UMass in the early 90s. However, as their programs grew and they became competitors, their relationship soured. A second-round matchup of St John’s and Arkansas could bring plenty of drama. NL\n\nI’m curious to see how LSU adjust after multiple late-season losses, with or without Flau’jae Johnson. She recently admitted that she’s been playing “the worst basketball” of her career, and it’s clearly hurt the team. Now, with news that she’s out indefinitely, the question is whether Kim Mulkey’s group has the IQ and chemistry to make a Final Four run. TR\n\nDark horse team to watch …\n\nThree teams have won back-to-back NCAA men’s titles in the last 50 years: Duke (1991-92), Florida (2006-07) and Connecticut (2023-24). The 1993 Duke team were dumped by California in the second round, and the 2008 Gators did not even make the NCAA Tournament. UConn (23-10) are a mere No 8 seed this year, but watch Dan Hurley drag the Huskies farther than either of the previous two-time champs. UCLA, by the way, were the last team to win at least three titles in a row, rolling to seven straight from 1967 to 1973. DC\n\nOn the women’s side, Ole Miss. They were already so much fun to watch in their season opener in Paris last year, but the team have grown steadily since then and it wouldn’t be a total surprise if they make a deep run. Assuming they beat No 4 Baylor in the first round, the Landsharks will likely face top overall seed UCLA … who they could probably beat. Maybe. SK\n\nYou know your program is elite when a 25-8 season feels like a down year. That’s where Gonzaga’s men’s team are but Mark Few still has a group who rank ninth in the country in adjusted offense. There aren’t many coaches who know how to win in the tournament like Few and his team is coming off a WCC championship run where they avenged their two regular-season losses to Saint Mary’s. NL\n\nThe Tennessee Lady Vols weren’t on my radar as serious contenders until recently. Their wins over UConn and Iowa proved they’re a team to watch. Before those upsets, they weren’t part of the big-team conversation, and those victories felt more like surprising wins than expected outcomes. The No 5 seed in the Texas Longhorns’ quarter of the bracket, they’re easy to overlook, especially without a clear star player. TR\n\nThe most vulnerable top seed is …\n\nThe women’s four top seeds appear to be stronger than the men’s four top seeds. Of the four men’s top seeds, Auburn (28-5), the No 1 seed overall, lost three of their last four games after winning 27 of their first 29 – although the Southeastern Conference, with an astonishing 14 tournament teams, is quite easily the best league in the nation. DC\n\nIn the women’s tournament it’s Southern California, but that’s just because head coach Lindsay Gottlieb seems pretty concerned about playing in the same regional as UConn (which is fair). If she’s scared, I’m scared, too! Among the men’s teams, it’s Florida because Duke have something special going, Houston’s size and ball pressure are insurmountable and Auburn are the top overall seed on merit. SK\n\nDuke have an embarrassment of riches on their roster, but even so, having the best men’s player in the country dealing with injury is a tough blow. Will the likely No 1 overall pick in this year’s NBA draft risk playing through injury? Time will tell. NL\n\nSouthern California women. They rely too heavily on JuJu Watkins and struggle with team basketball – it’s as simple as getting the ball to Watkins, even her teammate Kiki Iriafen has said as much. And it reminds me a lot of last year’s Iowa where their strategy was simply getting Caitlin Clark the ball. TR\n\nOne bold prediction …\n\nThe energetic and entertaining Bill Raftery will once again stand alone among television commentators of either tournament, especially if he is egged on by play-by-play man Ian Eagle. Raftery, 81, is the enthusiastic ex-coach from New Jersey known for hollering “Onions!” when a player coolly hits a crucial big shot. Onions, in this case, represent testicles. DC\n\nNC State win the entire women’s tournament. There is something so special about the combination of Saniya Rivers, Aziaha James and Zamareya Jones and the way they absolutely hammer their opponents when the team is synchronized. I’d also love to see someone new in the championship game. SK\n\nThe University of California San Diego men are in their first season of postseason eligibility. If you appreciate ball movement and connected defense, you’ll enjoy watching this Triton team. They lead the country in turnover margin, and their first-round opponent, Michigan, are prone to turnovers. The size difference is concerning but the Tritons have been elite at doubling the post all year. Let’s see if this is the upset we are all looking for. NL\n\nLast year, $2.7bn was legally wagered on the tournament, and I believe this year will surpass that significantly. With the unpredictability of the season – including major losses from even some of the best teams – more people may be inclined to place bets. With gambling culture gripping the US, total wagers could soar to as much as $7bn. TR\n\nMen’s final four\n\nMichigan State, St John’s, Duke, Houston. DC\n\nMichigan State, Tennessee, Duke, Houston. SK\n\nAuburn, Texas Tech, Alabama, Houston. NL\n\nAuburn, Florida, Duke, Alabama. TR\n\nWomen’s final four\n\nUCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, Texas. DC\n\nNC State, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame. SK\n\nUCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, TCU. NL\n\nUCLA, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame. TR\n\nThe men’s champion will be ...\n\nSeven of the last nine NCAA champions have as the top seeds in their regions, which does not appear to be good news for non-No 1 seeds. But St John’s, a No 2 seed, have so much going for them – the crafty and rejuvenated Rick Pitino, 19 victories in 20 games, the adoration of a city that loves basketball – that it seems silly to pick against the Red Storm. DC\n\nDuke. There’s a lot of chatter about the difficulty of building a championship team with freshmen, but one needs to look only at the not-so-distant past to see that it can be done. Carmelo Anthony, Gerry McNamara and Billy Edelin powered Syracuse to a natty in 2003, a feat replicated by Kentucky’s 2012 squad featuring Anthony Davis. And Duke’s own history backs up the possibility: in 2015 the men’s program pulled off the same feat. That’s as long as Flagg is playing. If not, then it’s anyone’s game. SK\n\nAlabama are battled-tested playing in the rugged SEC. The Crimson Tide play at an uncomfortable pace for their opponents and they have veteran guard play. Mark Sears can be streaky but the kid has proven to be a gamer. Bama rank fourth in adjusted offense and 32nd in adjusted defense in the country. If they can tighten up on the defensive end I like them to cut down the nets in San Antonio. NL\n\nDuke have the star power of Flagg – if he’s healthy – but more importantly, they have a strong system and the depth to back it up. Meanwhile, I question the strength of their competition: No 1 overall seed Auburn have a lack of experience in winning a national championship and may struggle to perform under the tournament’s intense pressure, and Houston are missing key quality wins and depth due to injuries to some of their crucial players. TR\n\nThe women’s champion will be ...\n\nSouth Carolina will win their third national title in four years – and fourth in eight – because coach Dawn Staley still patrols the sidelines. Although they are a No 1 seed, the Gamecocks have lost three games this year, or three more than in each of the last two years entering the tournament. But the Gamecocks are deep, tough and experienced, and Staley is the best, not to mention the most intense and audacious, coach in the women’s game. DC\n\nUConn. Despite other teams trying to paint themselves as the underdog, Connecticut truly fit the bill in a few key ways. Though the Huskies have reached at least the Final Four every year since, their last championship win came in the 2015-16 season. This year, however, everything seems to be aligning in their favor. Bueckers is headed to the WNBA, Fudd may join her, whil Aubrey Griffin could hear her name called in the second round. The team is healthier than they’ve been in years and has fought its way out of a midseason slump that once seemed endless. SK\n\nSouthern California. Rarely does a freshman carry their team to a national championship (Carmelo Anthony being one notable exception). JuJu Watkins was close last year, and that experience seems to have fueled her, as she’s taken her game to another level. The Trojans enter the tournament with a 28-3 record, still feeling like they have something to prove. Watkins makes her case for the best player in the country as she leads USC to the school’s first national title since 1984. NL\n\nUConn. The storyline of Bueckers returning for her fifth year with a national championship in mind has been drilled into her teammates, coaches and the press for a while now – it would be foolish for them not to take it seriously. The Huskies’ three in-season losses were either close or were due to issues that have been addressed and ironed out. They play true team basketball, and while most teams are tightening their rotations at this stage, UConn are actually adding depth with previously injured players like Griffin, Fudd, Ice Brady and Caroline Ducharme now healthy and ready to contribute. If they can remain healthy and mentally strong, UConn should regain their status as the strongest women’s college program in the land. TR\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has taken the momentous step of undoing the Department of Education on Thursday by signing an executive order to dismantle the agency in charge of the country’s national education policy.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, Trump fulfills a campaign promise he made all the way back in 2016.\n\nWhat is the Department of Education? The Department of Education is a cabinet-level agency created by Jimmy Carter in 1979 to oversee national education policy and administer federal assistance programs for schools across the country. The department manages a budget of approximately $268bn and employs about 4,400 staff members. Its core responsibilities have included distributing federal financial aid for education, collecting data on the US’s schools, identifying major educational issues and enforcing federal education laws prohibiting discrimination and implementing congressional education legislation. Among its most significant functions is administering federal student aid programs, providing billions in grants, work-study funds and loans to more than 13 million students. The agency also oversees programs addressing special education, English-language acquisition and education for disadvantaged students. Critics have long questioned the need for the department, arguing education should remain entirely under state and local control, while its supporters maintain it plays a crucial role in protecting educational equity and providing much-needed federal backing to schools serving vulnerable populations.\n\nCan Trump legally eliminate a government agency? Scrapping an entire department would require congressional approval – something that conservatives seeking to get rid of the education department have failed to do for decades. No president has ever successfully closed a cabinet-level agency enshrined in law before. And the constitutional separation of powers means the president’s executive authority alone isn’t sufficient to close the agency by the stroke of his pen. The White House has acknowledged this limitation, with administration officials confirming they don’t have the necessary votes in Congress to eliminate the department completely. So instead, Trump’s executive order would essentially direct the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure”, according to administration officials, while working within existing executive branch powers. This could include reorganizing certain functions, appointing leadership aligned with the aggressive drawing-down goal and potentially returning specific authorities to states where federal law permits.\n\nWhat does the executive order mean for American students? The mass weakening of the agency will undoubtedly create significant uncertainty for America’s 50 million public school students and their families, with impacts varying widely depending on how the directive is implemented. In the immediate term, most students will probably see little change to their daily educational experience, as schools primarily operate under state and local control and budgets for the year are already set. However, the long-term implications could be substantial if federal education programs are modified or reduced. Shuttering the department puts marginalized students most at risk, experts say. Since federal programs support special education, English-language learners and disadvantaged students, they face the brunt of the impact. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Idea), which provides protections for students with disabilities, is federally enforced through the department.",

Honey, we’re going to call a fig a fig, and we’re going to call a Nazi salute what it was,” Wilson said. “That shit was definitely a Nazi salute.”\n\nWilson entered the public eye last year after Musk spoke about her in a podcast, saying that he had been “tricked” into signing documents so that Wilson, who was 16 at the time, could receive gender-affirming medical treatment.\n\n“I lost my son, essentially. They call it ‘deadnaming’ for a reason. The reason they call it ‘deadnaming’ is because your son is dead.” he said. Musk added that the experience made him vow “to destroy the woke mind virus after that, and we’re making some progress”.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last year, Wilson said that Musk had been largely absent in her life and that he was often cruel to her for showing feminine traits when she was growing up. She went to California court in 2022 to officially remove “Musk” from her name, saying in court filings she “no longer live[s] with or wish[es] to be related to my biological father in any way shape or form”.\n\n“He was cold,” she told NBC News. “He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic.”\n\nBy law, Wilson had to get her father, whom she had not spoken to for months at that point, to sign off on her receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, since she was a minor at the time.\n\n“I was constantly having mental breakdowns in the middle of class. I could not get through days. I didn’t want to wake up, I didn’t want to do anything. I just wanted to rot, pretty much. It was like, I cannot do this,” she said. “If I stay in the closet anymore, this is going to take me down a very destructive path.”\n\nWilson, who is currently a student in Tokyo, said that she felt obligated to talk about trans issues as someone who transitioned as a minor.\n\n“There’s so much villainization of that, and I would really like to raise awareness of the fact that trans care for minors, especially puberty blockers, is really important,” she said. “Maybe stop demonizing these literal children or the people around these children who are just trying to help them feel comfortable in their own skin.”\n\nOver the last several years, conservatives have targeted the transgender community through legislation. Since coming into office, Trump has signed executive orders banning transgender people from the military and from participating in women’s sports. On Wednesday, a federal judge blocked Trump’s ban on trans people serving in the military.\n\n“As a trans woman, I am terrified of losing access to guaranteed medical care. If I didn’t medically transition at the age I did, I don’t know what would’ve happened,” Wilson said.\n\nWilson said that her mother, Justine Musk, Musk’s first wife, had been supportive of her and that she “doesn’t keep up with [Musk’s] side of the family”. Musk, an outspoken pronatalist, has 14 children with four different women.\n\nWhen asked whether she is on good terms with her siblings, Wilson responded: “I will say I do not actually know how many siblings I have, if you include half-siblings.”\n\nThough her father is a billionaire who is playing a major role in the Trump administration, Wilson said Musk doesn’t loom large in her life.\n\n“People thrive off of fear. I’m not giving anyone that space in my mind,” she said. “The only thing that gets to live free in my mind are drag queens.”",

        "content": "A federal judge instructed the Trump administration on Thursday to explain why its failure to turn around flights carrying deportees to El Salvador did not violate his court order in a growing showdown between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nJames Boasberg, the US district judge, demanded answers after flights carrying Venezuelan immigrants alleged by the Trump administration to be gang members landed in El Salvador after the judge temporarily blocked deportations conducted under an 18th-century wartime law. Boasberg had directed the administration to return planes that were already in the air to the US when he ordered the halt.\n\nBoasberg had given the administration until noon Thursday to either provide more details about the flights or make a claim that they must be withheld because they would harm “state secrets”. The administration resisted the judge’s request, calling it an “unnecessary judicial fishing” expedition.\n\nIn a written order, Boasberg called Trump officials’ latest response “woefully insufficient”. The judge said the administration “again evaded its obligations” by merely repeating “the same general information about the flights”. He ordered the administration to “show cause” as to why it did not follow his court order to turn around the planes, increasing the prospect that he may consider holding administration officials in contempt of court.\n\nThe justice department has said the judge’s verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it could not apply to flights that had already left the US. A justice department spokesperson said on Thursday that it “continues to believe that the court’s superfluous questioning of sensitive national security information is inappropriate judicial overreach”.\n\nA US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told the judge on Thursday the administration needed more time to decide whether it would invoke the state secrets privilege in an effort to block the information’s release.\n\nBoasberg then ordered Trump officials to submit a sworn declaration by Friday by a person “with direct involvement in the Cabinet-level discussions” about the state secrets privilege and to tell the court by next Tuesday whether the administration will invoke it.\n\nIn a deepening conflict between the judicial and executive branches, the US president and many of his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by Barack Obama. In a rare statement earlier this week, John Roberts, the supreme court chief justice, rejected such calls, saying “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "content": "A veteran FBI agent who blew the whistle on alleged political bias during Donald Trump’s first presidency was arrested at New York’s JFK airport moments before boarding an international flight.\n\nJohnathan Buma, a 15-year counterintelligence officer and eventual whistleblower, now faces charges of illegally disclosing classified information through a prospective tell-all book about his career.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Buma systematically harvested confidential materials from the bureau’s internal systems, printing approximately 130 files clearly marked with security warnings in October 2023 before going on leave.\n\nHe allegedly shared draft portions of a book manuscript via email that contained information about “the FBI’s efforts and investigations into a foreign country’s weapons of mass destruction (‘WMD’) program”, the filing reads.\n\nDuring a Brooklyn federal court hearing on Tuesday, Buma was released on $100,000 bail, though the case will be handled in California federal court. He has not entered a plea.\n\nThe investigation into the FBI agent began during the Biden administration, when his home was raided in late 2023.\n\nThat year, Buma told Business Insider about what he described as differential treatment of politically sensitive cases. He described an incident during which he allegedly presented information about potential criminal actions involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to a supervisor at the Los Angeles field office – prompting his boss to advance the case. Then when he went to raise concerns in the same meeting that the former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani might have been compromised in a Russian counter-influence operation, Buma says his superior moved to immediately dismiss the matter altogether.\n\nIn a semi-redacted statement to the Senate in 2023, Buma explained how he was “at my wits’ end” and filed a whistleblower complaint in January 2022 alleging “numerous acts of intelligence suppression” related to his reporting on foreign intelligence matters. The complaint also claimed he faced retaliation for voicing his concerns, and he filed an Equal Employment Opportunities complaint later that year.\n\nFollowing the October 2023 raid on Buma’s home, his attorney Scott Horton denied any wrongdoing and claimed no classified information was found.",

        "title": "Trump signs executive order to dismantle US Department of Education",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that instructs the US education secretary, Linda McMahon, to start dismantling the Department of Education, seemingly attempting to circumvent the need to obtain congressional approval to formally close a federal department.\n\nThe administration may eventually pursue an effort to get Congress to shut down the agency, Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House on Thursday, because its budget had more than doubled in size in recent years but national test scores had not improved.\n\nThe federal government does not mandate curriculum in schools; that has been the responsibility of state and local governments, which provide 90% of the funding to schools. Nevertheless, at the White House, Trump repeated his campaign promise to “send education back to the states”.\n\nThe executive order targeting the education department, which has been expected for weeks, directed McMahon to take all necessary steps to shut down key functionalities. Trump added at the signing ceremony that he hoped McMahon would be the last education secretary.\n\n“My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We’re going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It’s doing us no good,” Trump said.\n\nMcMahon appeared to smile in acknowledgment as she sat in the front row at the signing event in the East Room. Trump spoke from a stage in front of a row of state flags, and flanked on each side by a group of schoolchildren sitting at small desks.\n\nThe bulk of the education department’s budget is made up of federal grant and loan programs, including the $18.4bn Title I program that provides funding to high-poverty K-12 schools and the $15.5bn Idea program that helps cover the education costs for students with disabilities.\n\nThe White House said those programs, as well as the $1.6tn federal student loan program, would not be affected by the order. It was not immediately clear what spending cuts the administration would be able to achieve without cutting those initiatives.\n\nThe move comes after the administration has already taken steps to undercut the department’s authority by instituting a round of layoffs that has reduced its workforce by nearly half and cancelled dozens of grants and contracts.\n\nThe idea of shutting down the education department dates back to efforts by Republicans in the 1980s. But the push has become increasingly mainstream in recent years as pro-Trump grassroots activists took aim at agendas that promoted education standards and more inclusive policies.\n\nCongressman Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, separately introduced a one-sentence bill in January that would terminate the education department at the end of 2026. Similar efforts have failed to get enough votes to pass in previous years.\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to shutter the education department have largely followed the playbook in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto to remake the federal government, which envisions the department as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill denounced the executive order and warned it could leave in jeopardy millions of low-income families, who rely on federal funding in schools.\n\n“Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation’s public schools, their families and hardworking teachers. Class sizes will soar, educators will be fired, special education programs will be cut and college will get even more expensive,” Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a statement.\n\nThe progressive wing of the House Democratic caucus also denounced Trump’s order as an unconstitutional attempt to evade seeking congressional approval to implement his political agenda.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Programs that don’t affect students directly, such as those that go toward teacher training, could also be on the chopping block. Expanding the use and promotion of school vouchers and installing “parents’ rights” policies are also likely.\n\nIn late January, Trump signed executive orders to promote school choice, or the use of public dollars for private education, and to remove funding from schools accused of “radical indoctrination”. Trump also revived a “1776 commission” to “promote patriotic education”.\n\nThe education department boasted that in the first week of the Trump administration it had “dismantled” diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nSoon after Trump took over, the department was loaded with key staffers tied to a rightwing thinktank, the America First Policy Institute, often referred to as a “White House in waiting”. The thinktank has supported driving out diversity programs and banning books, which the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism documented in a report on the institute’s ties to the education department. The policy institute has promoted installing Christianity in government, including in schools.\n\nThe department ended investigations into book banning and got rid of a book-ban coordinator position last month in a move announced by Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, who previously held a role at the thinktank.",

        "content": "The United States has refused a request by Mexico for water, alleging shortfalls in sharing by its southern neighbor, as Donald Trump ramps up a battle on another front.\n\nThe state department said on Thursday it was the first time that the United States had rejected a request by Mexico for special delivery of water, which would have gone to the border city of Tijuana.\n\n“Mexico’s continued shortfalls in its water deliveries under the 1944 water-sharing treaty are decimating American agriculture – particularly farmers in the Rio Grande valley,” the state department’s bureau handling Latin America said in a post on X.\n\nThe 1944 treaty, which governs water allocation from the Rio Grande and Colorado River, has come under growing strain in recent years due to the pressures of the climate crisis and the burgeoning populations and agriculture in parched areas.\n\nThe treaty sets five-year cycles for water deliveries, with the latest set to end in October 2025.\n\nUnder the treaty, Mexico sends water from rivers in the Rio Grande basin to the US, which in turn sends Mexico water from the Colorado River, further to the west. But Mexico has fallen behind in its water payments due to drought conditions in the arid north of the country.\n\nUS farmers and lawmakers complain that the neighboring country has waited until the end of each cycle in the past and has come up short in the latest period.\n\nThe treaty is very contentious south of the border, where Mexican farmers have been struggling with intense drought in recent years.\n\nA year ago the last sugar mill in southern Texas shut down, blaming a lack of water deliveries from Mexico.\n\nAfter 18 months of negotiations, the United States and Mexico reached an agreement in November, days after Trump’s election, to improve deliveries.\n\nHailed then by the Biden administration, the understanding calls for Mexico to work with the United States to deliver water in a more timely way, including earlier in each five-year cycle.\n\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Thursday before the state department announcement that the water issue was “being dealt with” through the two countries’ boundary and water commission.\n\n“There’s been less water. That’s part of the problem,” she told reporters.\n\nTijuana, a sprawling city on the border with the US state of California that has become a hub for manufacturing, depends on the Colorado River for about 90% of its water and has suffered waste from creaky infrastructure.\n\nThe Colorado River, also a major water source for Los Angeles and Las Vegas, has seen its water levels shrink due to drought and heavy agricultural consumption in the south-western United States, with around half of its water going to raise beef and dairy cattle.\n\nIn southern Texas, farmers have voiced fear for the future of cotton, citrus and other farming products without more regular water deliveries from across the border in Mexico.\n\nBrooke Rollins, the US agriculture secretary, on Wednesday announced $280m in relief funds for Rio Grande valley farmers.\n\n“Texas farmers are in crisis because of Mexico’s noncompliance,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on X, praising the state department’s water decision.\n\n“I will work with the Trump administration to pressure Mexico into complying and to get water to Texas farmers.”\n\nThe water dispute comes as Trump takes a tough approach to Latin American countries, especially on migration.\n\nTrump on returning to office has vowed to end arrivals of undocumented migrants, who largely come from Central America and Venezuela but transit through Mexico.\n\nTrump deployed troops to the border and announced painful tariffs on Mexico, although he has since put them on hold until 2 April.",

It was important. The authorities were simulating a large-scale evacuation, the kind they would have to carry out in the event of a volcanic eruption in the seismically active Campi Flegrei or Phlegraean Fields near the southern Italian city of Naples.\n\nEveryone in the sprawling volcanic area hopes it will never happen, but the signs are ominous.\n\nView image in fullscreen During an exercise to simulate an evacuation in the event of a volcanic eruption in the Phlegraean Fields, Angelo Di Roberto, 70, his nephew of the same name, 12, and Alessandro Celardo, 29, all from Monterusciello, arrive at Naples central station, from where in theory they should depart for Milan.\n\nSince January 2024, the land in certain parts of the Phlegraean Fields has risen by about 20 centimetres (eight inches) as a result of a phenomenon called bradyseism, the gradual uplift or lowering of part of the Earth’s surface caused by the filling or emptying of an underground magma chamber or hydrothermal activity, particularly in volcanic calderas.\n\nEarthquakes continue to be recorded almost every day. There were 6,066 in 2023 and as many as 6,740 in 2024. The seismic swarm continues in 2025, generating anxiety and fear that leads many people to spend nights in their cars or outdoors. The most violent earthquake to hit the area for four decades shook buildings in and around Naples earlier this month.\n\nEvery year 700,000 tourists climb the great cone of Vesuvius to admire one of the most beautiful gulfs in the world. But if you stretch your gaze westwards, beyond Fuorigrotta, you catch a glimpse of other small, almost completely unknown volcanoes: these are the Phlegraean Fields, an enormous caldera which is home to more than 600,000 people.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Monte Nuovo crater with the Naples bypass on the left and the town of Pozzuoli on the right.

It raised Pozzuoli by two metres in the 1980s, leading to the evacuation of 40,000 people from the Rione Terra neighbourhood.\n\nBradyseism has always existed in these parts.

But this is an expected phenomenon and it is very likely that earthquakes will continue. We will all have to get used to reacting in a positive way, without panicking. We scientists cannot exclude anything. Our job is to monitor and measure the parameters.”\n\nThe Phlegraean Fields are among the most monitored volcanoes in the world, designed to detect the smallest sign of an awakening that will happen sooner or later.

They have also generated thermal emissions that have been exploited for centuries and provided precious yellow ash stone known as tuff, with which Campania’s towns were built.

One is dedicated to the melting of the blood of San Gennaro, which for centuries has been thought by some to ward off magma.

        "content": "A rainy day in Santa Barbara, and Jeff Bridges sits in his garage, wondering where his favourite spectacles have got to. We are in the middle of a rangy conversation on a video call, meandering our way from Bob Dylan to the anthropomorphism of bees, via Crazy Heart, Cutter’s Way and The Big Lebowski. There are sidetracks and double-backs and loose threads. Intermittently, an unseen assistant hands the actor pairs of glasses seemingly identical to the ones he is already wearing. Bridges, in a soft brown cardigan, inspects each pair and dismisses them. “Where was I?” he asks.\n\nThe garage here serves as Bridges’ jam space and ceramics workshop. He has drums set up for his grandson, and a picture of Captain Beefheart on the wall. Since December, when his FX series The Old Man was cancelled, the 75-year-old has been spending more of his days here. “Now I’ve got some time for letting some other things bubble up and I’m really happy about that,” he says. “A lot of music, some more art stuff.”\n\nBridges is good at finding the silver lining. Mention the recent loss of his Malibu home in the Los Angeles fires, for instance, and he is sanguine. “We’ve lost five homes to fires, earthquakes, floods. We’re waiting for the locusts,” he says. His 2020 diagnosis and subsequent treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma – or, in Bridges words, “some real health issues” – is mentioned only in passing, as the catalyst for him to release more music: “Hey,” he reasons, “if you’ve got some stuff that you want to share, now’s the time, man!” I tell him how despite it all he seems remarkably chipper, and he smiles. “Absolutely,” he says. “I’m happy.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘After a movie your pretend muscle gets exhausted’ … Jeff Bridges (left) and Cybill Shepherd in The Last Picture Show, 1971. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nThe primary focus of our conversation today is intended to be Slow Magic, a collection of Bridges songs lost for close to 50 years and now due to be released on Record Store Day. The way the release came about, he says, “is so mysterious and wonderful to me. Shall I give you a little history?” He launches into a story that involves the musicians Keefus Ciancia and T Bone Burnett, a Squarespace advertisement for the Super Bowl, the 1975 comedy Hearts of the West, the New Age music charts, and a single cassette tape of some tunes Bridges had set down with some old high school buddies, labelled “July 1978”. One soon grasps that much of Bridges’ life has moved this way, in bursts of what we might regard as cosmic serendipity and connection.\n\nView image in fullscreen A young Jeff Bridges. Photograph: Candy Clark\n\nBridges was born into a well-known Hollywood family. His mother, Dorothy, and his father, Lloyd, were both actors, as was his older brother, Beau. Although the young Jeff showed promise in art and music, his father encouraged him to join the family business, taking him along to set, securing him minor roles on his productions. “I had questions about what I was going to do, and my dad would say: ‘Jeff, don’t be ridiculous, that’s the wonderful thing about acting, it’s going to call upon all of your interests.’”\n\nAll the family loved music. They would sit around the piano, singing show tunes together. One of Bridges’ earliest memories involves the Broadway composer Meredith Willson visiting the family home to try to persuade his father to take the lead role in The Music Man. “His wife, Rini, was playing the piano and Meredith Willson was coming up to me singing: ‘You got trouble! Right here in River City!’”\n\nHe was a teenager in the 1960s, just as music shifted gear from the early rock’n’roll of Chuck Berry and the Everly Brothers to the likes of the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. “I mean every day, can you imagine, waking up going to school and here are the new Beatles songs?” he says. “And that happened over and over! You take it for granted, kind of, but it’s amazing!”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘To do a movie, to bring me to the party, I resist’ … Jeff Bridges in The Last American Hero, 1973. Photograph: Rojo Productions/RGR Collection/Alamy\n\nBridges’ high school was largely made up of the children of the entertainment industry. He hung out with an artsy bohemian crowd, rather than the jocks, each school day starting by getting stoned in his Buick while he and his buddies listened to the radio: “[There was] a lot of drug experimentation you know, during those times.”\n\nOn Wednesday evenings, a group of them would meet for a jam session at his friend Steve Baim’s home. “There was a main rule that there were no songs allowed,” Bridges says. “Singing was encouraged, and making up songs, but nothing that would be played on the radio or anything like that. Just a big jam session.” As they left high school and moved through their lives, the Wednesday Night Jams continued – a way of rooting the group in their city, their friendship and their creativity. At some point around 1977, Bridges, who had been writing music alongside acting, invited his friends over to record some of his tunes. “And the album is a result of that.”\n\nDespite his father’s advice, music had always remained an alluring and viable career path for Bridges. In the late 60s he even sold two songs to Quincy Jones, who used one of them, Lost in Space, for the soundtrack of John and Mary, starring Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow. As time went on, the indecision continued. “I’d done 10 movies, I’d been nominated for an Academy Award [best supporting actor for The Last Picture Show, 1971], and I still wasn’t…” He pauses, and his eyes glance off to the assistant once more. “Oh thank you dear, I appreciate that,” he says, taking the latest pair of spectacles. “Those are the ones!” He says, then looks at them more closely. “No, these are not the ones!”\n\nSomething of a shift happened after making 1973 motor sports movie The Last American Hero. “I had a great time making it, but usually after a movie your pretend muscle gets exhausted,” Bridges says. “You don’t want to pretend any more, you just want to be who you really are and not be in character.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘A little experiment on myself’ … (from left): Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges and Sorrell Booke in The Iceman Cometh, 1973. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy\n\nShortly after filming wrapped, his agent was approached by the director John Frankenheimer with a part in his adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh. Bridges knew it would be a big deal – Frederic March, Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin were already signed up. Nevertheless, he was unsure. He told his agent to turn down the role. Five minutes later, he received a call from Lamont Johnson, director of The Last American Hero. “He said: ‘I heard you turned down The Iceman Cometh?’ I said ‘Yeah Monty, I’m bushed, man.’ And he says, ‘You’re bushed? You’re an ass!’ And he hung up on me!”\n\nBridges took stock and decided “to do a little experiment on myself and go kind of against what my intuition is telling me”. He took the role, loved the movie, and decided he would throw his hat fully into the acting ring.\n\nIt was an early example of Bridges exploring what he regards as the resistant element in himself. “I find I have a lot of resistance, that’s kind of how I roll,” he says. “To do a movie, to bring me to the party, I resist, I resist. And there’s such satisfaction in exploring that resistance and getting on the other side, not being afraid of it.”\n\nLately, he has been examining his resistance to cold. “I’m getting into the cold-plunging, I’ve been doing that for a while, and my relationship with cold has shifted a bit,” he says. “Normally you think of cold as an enemy, but it’s just a feeling. All of those different emotions that come up, they’re no big thing man! Come on!” He was always this way, he says, always resistant. “I don’t think I’ve changed much since I was a little kid. I feel basically the same.” I ask Bridges how he would describe himself at his essence, and he leans back in his chair and thinks. After a moment, he smiles, broadly. “Frightened, and game.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I don’t think I’ve changed much since I was a little kid’ … Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski, 1998. Photograph: Maximum Film/Alamy\n\nHe is reluctant to be drawn on how different his relationship with music might be to his relationship with acting – whether it still holds any of that same resistance, if it requires him to use his “pretend” muscle. “It’s a facet of myself,” he says. “I don’t think we ultimately know who we really are all the time. The task for all these different things, whether it’s acting, music, painting, ceramics, the main task is getting out of the way, letting the thing come through you. And it can be frightening sometimes. But sometimes it just has its way with you, and when that happens, man it’s a gas! And when it happens with a bunch of other artists and you’re all doing it together, it’s real magic. It’s the magic of trees and flowers.”\n\nMusic has often been the thing that has glued together the various facets of himself, and connected Bridges to others. “Whether it’s making a movie or music, you’re harmonising,” he says. “You’re saying: let’s combine our strengths here and see what we can come up with and make it beautiful and real.”\n\nOften, he will make a playlist for the character he’s playing (for the Dude in The Big Lebowski, it was “a lot of Creedence”). “Then you play them in the makeup trailer,” he says. “You get made up with all the guys in the show, you make that transition from who you are back into your characters. You get painted, you share music.”\n\nHe recalls shooting 1984’s Against All Odds in Mexico with Taylor Hackford, and how on their first night in Mexico “we split a bottle of tequila, and went through the whole Beatles catalogue”. How, stuck for nine months on the set of Heaven’s Gate in Montana, Kris Kristofferson and T Bone Burnett invited a string of musical friends to join them. “And we would just jam all the time. When we weren’t working, we were playing.” Later, when he was offered the lead in Crazy Heart, playing an alcoholic country singer trying to turn his life around, he took the part because Burnett signed on to write the score.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘When we weren’t working, we were playing’ … Jeff Bridges on stage with the Abiders at the Lebowski fest in 2014. Photograph: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nIn 2003, Bridges appeared alongside Bob Dylan in Masked and Anonymous. One day the director, Larry Charles, made a suggestion: “Why don’t you and Bob go off and you teach Bob some acting? Go and do some improvisation or something.” Bridges, resistant, eventually agreed. “He was so great to work with,” he says. “He’s such an incredible actor. I mean his presence, right?”\n\nNot long afterwards, Bridges was in his trailer, playing guitar, when Dylan appeared in the doorway. “He said ‘Hey man, you want to jam?’” Bridges still looks flabbergasted. I ask if he saw A Complete Unknown. “Yeah, yeah,” he says. “They all did such a great job but …” He seems puzzled by the film’s existence. “You know, you got the real thing …”\n\nLately, Bridges has been spending a little time going through what he calls his “song mine”, wondering what to do with all the tunes he’s written. He is still writing. The songs fill his notebooks and his GarageBand files. Sometimes he sets them down with Ciancia in their band the Abiders. Sometimes he puts them out as rough sketches on his website under the banner Emergent Behaviour. He asks only that if you dig them, you might make a donation to his chosen charities, No Kid Hungry and the Amazon Conservation Team. “Let’s create beautifully together,” the website suggests.\n\n“I wrote a song recently about my old buddy John Goodwin,” Bridges tells me. He and Goodwin grew up in the same neighbourhood, and Goodwin became a professional songwriter – he provided material for the Crazy Heart soundtrack, which won an Oscar and two Grammys, and for Bridges’ self-titled 2011 album, recorded after the film’s success.\n\nView image in fullscreen The artwork for Slow Magic, 1977-1978.\n\nBridges has called his Goodwin tribute song We Know That One. “I don’t know what style you’d call it. It’s my own style, kind of. Let me see if I can find it …” He picks up a tablet, peers at the screen. “All right. Let’s see here. Scrolling, scrolling, music, lyrics, my lyrics, my chorus, lyrics …”\n\nIn the quiet of his garage, Bridges leans far back in his chair, hands behind his head, and begins to sing. His voice is dusky, and warm and kind, and as he sings, something about him seems to glow. The music is having its way with him, and it is real magic; the magic of trees and flowers.\n\n“From the top it looks deep, from the bottom it looks high,\n\nDive into the lake through the reflection of the sky.\n\nNo need feeling lonely Johnny, on this road heading home,\n\nWe’re all heading that way, no one’s really alone.\n\nCan’t you hear us laughing as we cover our gold with the ashes,\n\nOur freedom, yeah we’re ditching our souls.\n\nJohnny can’t you see we use hilarity to numb.\n\nI think we’re just too damn sensitive Johnny, we couldn’t be that dumb.\n\nDo we need some kind of friction? Do we need some kind of brakes?\n\nSomething dragging in the dirt, is that what it takes to get us home Johnny, get us home safe?\n\nIn that case, maybe laughing ain’t too bad while we wait.\n\nI can feel my soul waiting for me up ahead, tapping his foot, he’s covered all bets.\n\nHe’s waiting with yours Johnny, they’re playing in the sun,\n\nHear that tune they’re playing, we know that one …”",

Delahunty confirmed that the fire damaged the substation’s primary transformer, while the backup transformer sustained heat damage during the blaze. The team is currently focused on bringing a third transformer online as soon as possible, and is working with the owner of the local power distribution network to reconfigure the flow of electricity to reach homes and the Heathrow airport, she said.

Another, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” instructs the removal of all “radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”.\n\nAnti-trafficking organizations receive funding from a number of government bureaus including the Department of Justice, office for victims of crime, office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, office on violence against women, Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.\n\n‘This is going to benefit traffickers’\n\nThe rollback by the US government will affect the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report by the state department, which evaluates global anti-trafficking efforts. Internal communications reviewed by the Guardian show that department staff have been directed to omit data on marginalized communities from the report.\n\nThe office for victims of crime, part of the Department of Justice, removed the contents of a webpage titled Faces of Human Trafficking, which detailed the stories of survivors, including those of people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+. The page also contained educational resources on the legal needs and rights for victims, and on providing trauma-informed services. This content was replaced with a notice stating “this content is temporarily unavailable” in early February, according to captures by the Wayback Machine, a digital library website that takes periodical snapshots of websites to preserve their history.\n\n“A lot of people rely on the government for this type of information, accurate information, and it’s no longer going to be there. People are only going to care about one specific population of people, which is going to be white, blond hair, blue-eyed, straight cisgendered females,” says Jose Alfaro, a gay Latino survivor of child sex trafficking and anti-trafficking consultant.\n\nAccording to Alfaro, silencing discussion of vulnerable groups will deter trafficking victims from reporting the crimes committed against them. They may fear harassment, discrimination or not being believed, he said.\n\n“It’s going to further stigmatize and also push everything underground. This is going to benefit traffickers,” he said. “When you are further marginalizing and oppressing vulnerable groups, the response is going to be more homophobia, more transphobia, more racism, which then is going to create more vulnerabilities for those populations.”\n\nTraffickers often deliberately target victims from marginalized demographics they believe are less likely to report them. In Alfaro’s case, he was trafficked as a minor by a man now serving a 30-year sentence who specifically targeted gay teenagers from the Latino community.\n\nIt’s going to further stigmatize and also push everything underground. This is going to benefit traffickers Jose Alfaro\n\n“It was known to him that Latino males who were gay would be basically rejected from their families, and so they would be in an even more vulnerable place,” says Alfaro.\n\nLGBTQ+ individuals face heightened risk of trafficking due to systemic barriers in employment, housing and social services. These challenges make them prime targets for traffickers, who exploit financial instability and lack of familial support. Racism is also a risk factor for being a trafficking victim, since factors such as poverty, harmful stereotypes and being in the foster care system – where Black youth are overrepresented – further heighten vulnerability, creating conditions that traffickers exploit.\n\nPreviously collected data illustrates the disparities along fault lines of race and sexual orientation. For instance, in King county, Washington, 84% of child sex trafficking victims are Black, even though Black residents make up just 7% of the population. Latino communities also face high rates of exploitation, according to research by the anti-trafficking non-profit Polaris. The Trump administration’s directive prohibits anti-trafficking agencies from collecting such data.\n\n“Trafficking happens to those that are disproportionately vulnerable. We were able to have data to back that up, and then we were able to create and tailor programming specifically for those populations, and these executive orders rolled all of that back,” said one expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns of potential retaliation.\n\n‘People will die because of it’\n\nThe censorship efforts have also affected the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a major child safety non-profit which works to locate missing children and combat child sexual exploitation and trafficking, particularly online.\n\nNCMEC, whose main funder is the federal government, has been ordered to remove all references to LGBTQ+ people from its public-facing material, according to an email to NCMEC seen by the Guardian.\n\nNCMEC acts as a nationwide clearinghouse for reports about child abuse, which staff triage and forward to relevant law enforcement departments in the US and around the world. The center also provides education resources and data on trafficking, abductions and exploitation for law enforcement and others working on child safety issues. It manages distribution of the “Amber Alert” system that alerts the public to missing children.\n\nSince the issuing of the executive order, the organization has removed publications that reference gender identity, queer and transgender children from its website. This resulted in the removal of guides on missing children who may be suicidal, children missing from care, male victims of child sex trafficking and recognizing and preventing child sex trafficking.\n\nView image in fullscreen The website detailed the stories of survivors, including those of people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+, but has now been removed. Photograph: Office for Victims of Crime\n\n“Like many federally funded non-profits, NCMEC was directed by the DoJ to comply with executive order 14168 regarding gender ideology and to review our publicly facing materials to ensure compliance,” said an NCMEC spokesperson. “No changes to NCMEC services have been made regarding sexual orientation, race or immigration. NCMEC will continue to provide lifesaving support for all families and children who need our services. We remain committed to helping find missing children, combating child sexual exploitation and preventing child victimization.”\n\nAdditionally, anti-trafficking non-profits have also been informed by federal workers responsible for grant allocations that conservative Christian organizations that have guidelines more closely aligned with the executive orders will receive preference over federal grants for supporting survivors, according to one source with direct knowledge of the new grant funding mandates.\n\n“Organizations that don’t understand those kids or adults and why they’re disproportionately vulnerable, that maybe do conversion therapy – could be a faith-based organization that believes that being queer is wrong and will send you to hell – will still get funds,” said one expert. “People will die because of it.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA statement from the state department read: “We refrain from disclosing specific information regarding the Trafficking In Persons Report until it has received official approval and has been formally released by the Secretary of State to the public. The Department is committed to implementing President Trump’s executive orders.”\n\n‘Crime data drives modern policing’\n\nMajor police departments across the country, which receive federal grants for investigations on trafficking crimes from the Department of Homeland Security and the office of justice, have now been instructed to stop collecting data on victims’ race and LGBTQ+ identity, including for cases of violent crime and trafficking, according to a federal prosecutor.\n\nThe prosecutor, who specializes in violent crime and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, warned that the decision could undermine efforts to address targeted violence and hate crimes.\n\n“Crime data is super important and drives modern policing and law enforcement and making effective and appropriate decisions,” said the prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “It’s particularly important to understand where we’re putting our energies.”\n\nThe change could also mean that violent perpetrators targeting specific minority groups to assault are not charged with hate crimes or civil rights violations, the prosecutor added. Omitting information about crime victims’ sexuality or race from reports can hamper investigations and victim identification, the prosecutor said.\n\n“You can’t really take a victim-centered approach if we’re not allowed to categorically approach the victim for who they are as a person, like if we can’t acknowledge that they are trans,” said the prosecutor. “You can imagine the impact that’s going to have on how successful and how much people feel they’re willing to open up.”",

        "content": "A man has been found guilty at Manchester crown court of murdering his friend and cutting his body into dozens of pieces that were discovered in parks and nature reserves across Greater Manchester.\n\nMarcin Majerkiewicz, 42, killed Stuart Everett, 67, known as Benny, in a “brutal attack” at the house they shared in Eccles on 27 or 28 March last year, the court heard.\n\nAfter dismembering Everett, who was described by friends as “jolly” and “someone who everyone got on with”, Majerkiewicz used his phone to communicate with relatives, even sending birthday cards in an attempt to cover up his crime.\n\nHe was traced by police after a part of Everett’s body was found at Kersal Dale nature reserve by a member of the public on 4 April 2024.\n\nA police investigation was launched in which detectives spent thousands of hours trawling through CCTV footage to identify a person they referred to as “heavy bag man”, who was seen struggling to carry a large shopping bag near where the first body part was found.\n\nThey traced the man to a housing estate in Eccles and while going door-to-door for information an officer spotted Majerkiewicz, who matched the description of “heavy bag man”, getting on a bus. When they searched him, they found Everett’s phone and bank cards, which allowed them to identify the victim.\n\nDuring the trial, which lasted two and a half weeks, the jury heard how Everett had referred to Majerkiewicz as his “partner” in emails with a friend, and others had observed the pair seemed “close”.\n\nEverett, who was born to Polish parents and originally from Derby, had known his killer for more than a decade. They had their own bedrooms in the house, which Polish-born Majerkiewicz moved into after splitting with his ex-partner.\n\nIt is not known what led Majerkiewicz to kill Everett and he did not put forward a defence in court.\n\nA Home Office pathologist told the court it was possible to piece together the remains of Everett’s head, which showed evidence he was hit with a hammer-like weapon and is believed to have been cut up with hand tools.\n\nAfter the Kersal Dale discovery, further body parts were found in other green spaces, with one of the packages containing remains discovered by a member of the public.\n\nMajerkiewicz assumed the identity of his victim, using Everett’s phone to text his family, friends and the landlord – and even sending two handwritten birthday cards to family members. He used Everett’s bank accounts “as if they were his own”, the prosecution said.\n\n“By that time, he was, we say, already dead, and his body, including his face had been cut up by the defendant,” Jason Pitter KC, for the prosecution, told the court.\n\nOn 3 April, Majerkiewicz researched the address of Everett’s brother in Derby, and sent him a birthday card pretending to be Everett. The card had the defendant’s fingerprints on, the prosecution said, and read: “To Rich, happy birthday and all the best my old man :) Benny xxxx.”\n\nThe victim’s brother Richard Ziemacki gave a witness statement saying he had initially “not noticed anything unusual”, going by his messages and the card he received.\n\nHowever, on reflection, he told police: “I do not recognise the handwriting as belonging to my brother,” adding that his brother would not have used the phrase “my old man”.\n\nThe seniorinvestigating officer, Det Ch Supt Lewis Hughes, said: “This is a case of rarely seen complexity and scale, with detectives initially responding to partial human remains found deep within a secluded wood.\n\n“But we said from the start that we wouldn’t give up and the victim and their family remained at the forefront of our minds and actions throughout. We have been focused on both ensuring justice in this case, but also ensuring the victim could be returned to his family and laid to rest.\n\n“We knew from the beginning that we had a family somewhere that would one day learn the most distressing news that a family could ever hear, and ultimately from that moment onwards our duty was to recover and identify the victim in a respectful and dignified manner and this was just as important as solving the case and catching the killer.”\n\nMajerkiewicz will be sentenced at a later date.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has taken the momentous step of undoing the Department of Education on Thursday by signing an executive order to dismantle the agency in charge of the country’s national education policy.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, Trump fulfills a campaign promise he made all the way back in 2016.\n\nWhat is the Department of Education? The Department of Education is a cabinet-level agency created by Jimmy Carter in 1979 to oversee national education policy and administer federal assistance programs for schools across the country. The department manages a budget of approximately $268bn and employs about 4,400 staff members. Its core responsibilities have included distributing federal financial aid for education, collecting data on the US’s schools, identifying major educational issues and enforcing federal education laws prohibiting discrimination and implementing congressional education legislation. Among its most significant functions is administering federal student aid programs, providing billions in grants, work-study funds and loans to more than 13 million students. The agency also oversees programs addressing special education, English-language acquisition and education for disadvantaged students. Critics have long questioned the need for the department, arguing education should remain entirely under state and local control, while its supporters maintain it plays a crucial role in protecting educational equity and providing much-needed federal backing to schools serving vulnerable populations.\n\nCan Trump legally eliminate a government agency? Scrapping an entire department would require congressional approval – something that conservatives seeking to get rid of the education department have failed to do for decades. No president has ever successfully closed a cabinet-level agency enshrined in law before. And the constitutional separation of powers means the president’s executive authority alone isn’t sufficient to close the agency by the stroke of his pen. The White House has acknowledged this limitation, with administration officials confirming they don’t have the necessary votes in Congress to eliminate the department completely. So instead, Trump’s executive order would essentially direct the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure”, according to administration officials, while working within existing executive branch powers. This could include reorganizing certain functions, appointing leadership aligned with the aggressive drawing-down goal and potentially returning specific authorities to states where federal law permits.\n\nWhat does the executive order mean for American students? The mass weakening of the agency will undoubtedly create significant uncertainty for America’s 50 million public school students and their families, with impacts varying widely depending on how the directive is implemented. In the immediate term, most students will probably see little change to their daily educational experience, as schools primarily operate under state and local control and budgets for the year are already set. However, the long-term implications could be substantial if federal education programs are modified or reduced. Shuttering the department puts marginalized students most at risk, experts say. Since federal programs support special education, English-language learners and disadvantaged students, they face the brunt of the impact. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Idea), which provides protections for students with disabilities, is federally enforced through the department.",

        "content": "The Sunday showdown everyone wanted will happen, just not the way most expected.\n\nA desperate Canadian search for a men’s international trophy will stretch on to the summer after Raúl Jiménez clinically guided Mexico to a 2-0 win and a spot in the Concacaf Nations League Final against unlikely opponent Panama, who dispatched the US earlier on Thursday night.\n\nAmid Donald Trump’s “51st state” threats and tariffs, Mexico’s fellow 2026 World Cup hosts will now serve as curtain raisers back here on Sunday when a new name goes on the trophy for the first time after the US won each of its first three editions.\n\nAn instant opener and set-piece dagger did for the Canadians, who’d arrived laser-focused on winning it all but who lost concentration and temper. A bizarre VAR decision denying a penalty rubbed extra salt into the wound. Here in a city that specializes in delays, healing will have to happen quickly.\n\n“They really wanted to lift the trophy for the country,” Marsch said afterwards. “It was a knife in the heart to play well but then just short fall short. That disappointment is hard to shake.”\n\nThe Canadian team bus had snaked its way through South LA’s Thursday rush hour traffic and was pulling into the lower reaches of SoFi Stadium just as Cecilio Waterman arrowed a stunning injury-time winner past Matt Turner to turn this entire week on its head.\n\nThere was a joke to be found about a Panamanian called Waterman doing it for the canal. You’d hope someone in the bank of Canadian fans Concacaf had seated right next door to the US supporters group had found it. Either way, Panama being the team waiting for a Sunday night dance partner was surely not what the majority had been expecting.\n\nExpectations can be fragile things, of course. Marsch has spent his 10 months at the helm first confounding them then passionately demanding they are raised again and again, with last summer’s Copa América odyssey giving him instant evidence to point to. The squad he gathered here in LA, a group he described as the most talented in the country’s history, had bought in, all echoing their coach’s insistence that they were here for hardware. They’ll leave without it, but a showdown with the Americans offers more than mere consolation.\n\nView image in fullscreen Canada felt hard done by a few refereeing decisions. Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPA\n\nJavier Aguirre has solved some of Mexico’s pressing issues since returning for a third stint after last summer’s dispiriting Copa América. A sturdy but unspectacular 0-0 draw with Canada last September had been one brick in the rebuild. Here instead of deciding between two in-form frontmen in Jiménez and Santiago Giménez, he went for both, the latter coming in off the left.\n\nWithin just 45 seconds it paid off. Two sets of players had lined up but just one appeared to hear referee Saíd Martínez’s whistle. Johan Vásquez plucked a ball out of the air and sent it bobbling towards Jiménez who flicked it into his almost-namesake’s path. From there it bobbled again, Alphonso Davies deflected it on to Moïse Bombito and into Jiménez’s path. The Fulham striker made no mistake.\n\nThey’d only be somewhat successful in doing so as the first half became a breakneck, chaotic megamix of Concacaf classics. Five yellow cards flashed, Martínez threatened to lose control, and then an inexplicable VAR penalty decision.\n\nHow Canada weren’t awarded a spot-kick on nine minutes was a mystery. Captain Edson Álvarez swung a boot at a ball which Derek Cornelius got to first. SoFi’s giant infinity screens signalled that VAR was checking just as Martinez signalled a restart. On the sideline, Marsch looked in vain for answers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Free weekly newsletter Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me, this is the definition of a penalty.”\n\nWhile his players did find their feet, they never found control. In the space of 15 minutes midway through the half, Bombito, Alistair Johnston and Davies were all booked, with goalkeeper Dayne St Clair producing a great save from Giménez amid it all.\n\nMarsch is crystal clear in his demands for his team to be relentlessly aggressive but when the circumstances and an erratic official require a toning down, can it be done? In the 35th minute, Johnston tried to hoof a free-kick off the nearby Alexis Vega to get him booked. He missed and instead gifted possession back to Mexico, a moment that summed up plenty.\n\nRelief came, ironically from VAR, when Álvarez’s close-range header was ruled out five minutes before the break. Canada struggled mightily to create openings, the night finishing with just one shot on target. “We need to slow the game down [in attack],” he suggested. “We should have been able to create more given the way we were approaching the game.”\n\nMarsch had sprinted to the dressing rooms early at the interval and when his side continued to struggle for openings, he didn’t wait long to make changes. Wingers Jacob Shaffelburg and Tajon Buchanan asked to bring width, perhaps because in the middle Erik Lira was spoiling to terrific effect.\n\nThere would be no spoiling the night’s most alluring moment. With 15 minutes left, Jiménez stepped up to a set-piece that was 30-plus yards out and whipped a simply delicious effort that curled inside St Clair’s near post. Mexicans rained expensive cerveza down from above on the striker. A small price to pay. For Canada, tariffs and Trump will come back into the chatter. But the trophy talk is once more parked.",

He was on for pole on his final run before going wide at the hairpin and aborting the lap.

I don’t mind that she wants to go away with Mike, who I like. But she booked the trip without saying a word to me or my sister, Christine.\n\nIt’s not that we don’t want our mum to be happy, and Christine and I are both adults (I’m 28, she is 32). But since our dad died in 2016, we have spent every Christmas together as a family.\n\nThere’s no understanding from Mum of how it feels to have traditions suddenly change without your input. It’s especially difficult because these traditions were kept in place to make all of us feel more secure after Dad died. A little heads-up would have been nice.\n\nI know I’m almost 30 but my friends spend Christmas with their families.

It feels as though she doesn’t care about us as much now she’s met Mike.\n\nI know I’m almost 30, but my friends still spend Christmas with their families – it’s expected if that’s the way it’s always been. We are still grieving for Dad, so any changes in our family plans will impact us.\n\nI want Mum to be happy and enjoy her retirement, but also to listen to how Christine and I feel. She has been very adamant that she’s not in the wrong. We are all still speaking but it’s been difficult since she booked this holiday. I want to move forward and I know she does, too.\n\nThe defence: Margaret\n\nPaul called me selfish for booking the trip without telling him. But I’m 68 and want to see the world\n\nI recently booked a holiday with my partner Mike to Vietnam for Christmas. I’ve never been to Asia before and took inspiration from Christine and Paul, who travelled a lot in their early 20s. I never got to as I had responsibilities, such as raising them, but I’m retired now and want to see the world.\n\nHowever, Christine and Paul are annoyed that I booked the trip without telling them. We haven’t spoken much since I told them over the phone a few weeks ago. They both said I should have run it past them first, because we have spent every Christmas together since their father died.\n\nI understand that this is different for them, but their father hasn’t been around for almost 10 years and things change. I don’t think I need to ask their permission to enjoy my life. Paul called me selfish, which I was upset about. He said that because we’ve kept our Christmas traditions, they should have been consulted, but I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. I should be allowed to move on.\n\nMike says we should cancel the holiday and I’m starting to agree with him. I don’t want to cause a rift\n\nChristine and Paul get on with Mike, who I now live with. We bought a house together two years ago when I sold the family home my children grew up in. That was an emotional time, but my kids supported me.\n\nThey like Mike and know that their father wanted me to move on. He said so before he died after a long illness. But this holiday issue seems to have brought up lots of emotions for the kids. Christine is not happy and has barely said a word to me. We used to speak on the phone every week. Paul says he feels abandoned, but that was never my intention. Both of them live far away, and I’m worried they’ll stop coming to see me.\n\nMike says we should cancel the holiday and I’m starting to agree with him. I don’t want to cause a rift and it might be easier to just rearrange the trip for another time. My children are adults but are acting like toddlers over this. They are both single but that’s not my fault. It’s hard for everyone but I have to be able to do what I want. I’m 68 and after watching my husband die I sometimes worry how long I have left.\n\nThe jury of Guardian readers\n\nShould Margaret have consulted her adult children about her holiday plans?\n\nAlthough Margaret has every right to travel and enjoy her retirement, she should have realised this would be hard on the kids. I don’t think she needs to cancel the holiday, but acknowledging that she could have handled it better and maybe locking in another date to spend quality family time together would go a long way.\n\nEmily, 34\n\nThe family spending Christmas together is a convention, and Margaret has broken it without the courtesy of consulting her children and hearing their views.\n\nChris, 39\n\nAlthough I understand that the loss of a long-held family tradition is upsetting (and perhaps Margaret should have discussed this with her family first), it’s now time for her to have some fun. Paul is old enough to do something else. Maybe it’s time to start a new tradition?\n\nTheresa, 48\n\nMargaret isn’t guilty for wanting to make the most of her retirement with her new partner, but she is guilty for handling the situation insensitively. It sounds like a lot of hurt could have been avoided if she’d asked how her children felt about it before booking the holiday.\n\nFlo, 27\n\nInforming Paul and Christine would have prevented worries and hurt feelings for all involved. Don’t cancel the holiday though, enjoy it with mixed emotions – and with Mike, poor guy!\n\nFrits, 40\n\nNow you be the judge\n\nIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?\n\nThe poll closes on Thursday 27 March at 10am GMT\n\nLast week’s results\n\nWe asked whether Rupi’s boyfriend Raf was wrong to want to rip out the original fixtures and fittings in their Victorian house.\n\n95% of you said yes – Raf is guilty\n\n5% of you said no – Raf is not guilty",

        "title": "Big stars, little shine: is anyone actually watching Apple TV+ shows?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Next week Apple TV+ launches The Studio, a Seth Rogen comedy about the rapidly changing landscape of the film industry. Episodes follow a beleaguered executive as he’s forced to make an ugly IP movie, because streamers are in dominance and this is all traditional studios are left with.\n\nFor a show explicitly about the death of the theatrical experience to be made by a disruptive streamer – one funded by the deep pockets of a global tech megacorp to boot – is unquestionably a show of power. Or at least it would be, were it not for a new report claiming that Apple TV+ is currently losing a billion dollars a year.\n\nAccording to the Information, TV+ is currently the only Apple subscription service that isn’t profitable. This is said to be down to a number of factors. The first is that despite having 45 million subscribers, Apple blows through a $5bn production budget every year. And when a lot of it is being spent on blockbuster movies that squander every scrap of their potential – like the $200m spy disaster Argylle – then all this expense starts to look like bad financial sense. The report claims Apple TV+ is losing $1bn annually.\n\nAnother factor is that despite all those subscribers, very few people actually seem to watch anything on Apple TV+. The Information reports that Apple shows constitute less than 1% of total US streaming service viewing. In other words, while an Apple subscription ($8.99 a month) might be half the price of a Netflix subscription ($17.99 a month), people still watch eight times more Netflix than they do Apple.\n\nView image in fullscreen Mikey Madison and Natalie Portman in The Lady in the Lake. Photograph: AP\n\nIf you’re an Apple TV+ subscriber, this won’t come as particularly shocking news. Like most streaming services, the Apple TV+ homepage has a submenu containing its 10 most-watched series. Despite regularly putting out big expensive shows starring a full spectrum of household names, the second most-watched show on the service is currently Ted Lasso, a dormant sitcom that hasn’t put out a new episode in almost two years.\n\nThe rest of the list doesn’t do much to lift the spirits. The top show is Severance, a rare breakthrough hit that was recently named as the most-watched show in the service’s history. But third is Slow Horses (last episode October 2024). Ninth is Bad Sisters (last episode December 2024). Twelfth is For All Mankind (last episode January 2024). Dope Thief, which launched this week, is languishing at number five. It sits just behind Prime Target, another new show that died on impact.\n\nCompare this with Netflix, which has a top 10 so fiercely fought that it’s seen as momentous if a show can last a week at No 1, and it all starts to look a bit stagnant. Of course, this can be rationalised to some extent – Netflix puts out dozens of new originals every month, while Apple might only do one or two; Apple’s catalogue is lighter because it doesn’t bring in existing programming from elsewhere or locally produced foreign language shows – but still, a billion dollars a year is an awful lot of money.\n\nView image in fullscreen Colin Farrell in Sugar. Photograph: Jason LaVeris/AppleTV+\n\nWhat must be particularly galling for Apple is that the platform is what Netflix used to be. There’s no question that it attracts big-name talent. Natalie Portman has an Apple show. Harrison Ford has an Apple show. Austin Butler, Barry Keoghan, Cate Blanchett, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell and Brie Larson have all had Apple shows. The problem is, you wouldn’t be able to tell me the names of their shows if you had a gun to your head. Michael Douglas made an entire eight-part Apple biopic about Benjamin Franklin less than a year ago, for crying out loud. This is probably as much news to you as it is to me.\n\nAnd the shows it makes are actually good. There’s a heavy emphasis on quality and prestige, with complicated stories being told by visionary storytellers. Todd A Kessler’s The New Look, to name one show, was incredibly ambitious. It was a series about Christian Dior and Coco Chanel, and how their spirit of expression worked as an act of rebellion in Nazi-occupied France. With Ben Mendelsohn and Juliette Binoche, it starred two of the world’s best actors. It was absolutely sumptuous to look at. The problem is, you could stop people in the street for months before you found someone who had actually watched it.\n\nThere are signs that Apple is trying to turn the ship around. The recent news that a fourth season of Ted Lasso is on the way now might carry an air of desperation – after the disappointing third season nobody, not even the people who made it, seemed to want any more – but it’s a reliable hit on a platform that doesn’t exactly have a lot of reliable hits. Apple’s annual production budget has been slashed by $500m a year (or two and a half Argylles). According to the Information, management is also being a bit stingier about flying talent around in private jets, which has to help.\n\nBut that won’t help as much as one undeniable fact. If Apple starts making hits – properly marketed shows that people actually want to watch – all this could change in a heartbeat. After all, how hard could it be to find the next Severance?",

Vinícius scored the winner nine minutes into added time to rescue a much-needed win for Brazil who appeared destined for a third consecutive 1-1 draw after Luis Díaz cancelled out Raphinha’s early opener for the hosts in capital Brasília.\n\nThe victory lifted Brazil to second in South American qualifying with 21 points, four behind leaders Argentina and one ahead of Uruguay in third, both of whom have a game in hand and will clash on Friday.

But Brazil hit a wall after that and other than an angled strike from Rodrygo that sailed wide of the post in the 13th minute, they couldn’t create any real scoring opportunities.\n\nThey were also exposed to regular counterattacks with Colombia constantly threatening goalkeeper Alisson’s box. In the 40th minute, James Rodríguez pounced on a lapse in concentration from Newcastle midfielder Joelinton, taking possession on the edge of the box and finding Díaz who fired into the bottom right corner to equalise.\n\nBrazil came back livelier after the break and Vinícius Júnior forced a fine save from Camilo Vargas with an early strike for inside the box. But the pressure to find a goal appeared to take the wind out of their sails and as they wasted one chance after another, manager Dorival Júnior, who took the job a year ago, grew increasingly forlorn on the sidelines.\n\nHis despair turned to joy in the dying moments when Vinícius Júnior unleashed a curling strike from the edge of the box that evaded Vargas and found the back of the net. Brazil will now travel to face old rivals Argentina on Tuesday in a game where they will be without Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhães and Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimarães, both suspended after receiving yellow cards against Colombia.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Mauricio Pochettino faces numerous hurdles as head coach of the US men’s national team, but the most immediate among them on Thursday was the problem Panama has posed for his squad in major continental tournaments.\n\nThough Pochettino began his tenure with a 2-0 win against Panama on 12 October, Los Canaleros defeated the United States in two previous meetings: 2-1 during group play in last year’s Copa América – a loss that led to Gregg Berhalter’s firing as the United States’ coach – and 5-4 in penalties after a 1-1 draw in the semifinals of the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup.\n\nOn Thursday at SoFi Stadium, Panama didn’t just provide more untimely frustration, they made history in the process. When Cecilio Waterman scored in second-half stoppage time for a 1-0 victory in the semi-final on Thursday night, Panama became the first team in the still-nascent history of the Concacaf Nations League to prevent the United States from winning that tournament.\n\nLos Canaleros have a chance to win the Nations League for the first time Sunday by defeating Canada or Mexico in the final. The United States will play for third place in the first match of Sunday’s double-header.\n\n“We’re still building our identity,” forward Christian Pulisic said, “but this was a tough loss.”\n\nWaterman, who entered the game in the 70th minute, scored the winning goal off a pass from Adalberto Carrasquilla, firing a 15-yard diagonal shot from the right side of the penalty area past diving goalkeeper Matt Turner and inside the far post.\n\nWaterman’s shot was Panama’s only one on target.\n\n“Again, another small moment from nothing, and it’s a goal,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “We need to look in the mirror before anything and just realize that when we have these type of games, we can’t wait for something to happen. We have to make things happen, put games on our terms.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Josh Sargent came into the Nations League in good form but squandered a couple scoring chances v Panama. Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AP\n\nFollowing the goal, Waterman doffed his jersey, jumped over the advertising barriers and embraced a stunned Thierry Henry, who was doing analysis for CBS Sports and Paramount+. Waterman shouted, “Eres mi idolo,“ Spanish for “You’re my idol,” to the former Arsenal standout, as about half a dozen joyous teammates joined Waterman to celebrate.\n\n“They were hungry,” Pochettino said about his opponents. “They fight for the game, every single player, for every single ball. From the touch line, you feel that was the difference.\n\n“We didn’t compete in the way that the game required. I feel so disappointed. We all feel disappointed. If you don’t have aggression, it’s impossible. You are going to play safe. You are not going to take risks. If you want to play football, you need to take risks. You need to go forward. You need to win 50-50 balls sometimes.”\n\nThe United States’ Patrick Agyemang, who entered the match two minutes before Waterman, had two late chances to win the game, with the best of those coming in the 82nd minute.\n\nWeston McKennie began the potential scoring sequence by intercepting a pass intended for Carrasquilla and sending the ball to Agyemang on the run. After fighting off Panamanian defender Carlos Harvey, Agyemang forced goalkeeper Orlando Mosqueda to dive to his left to deflect his effort. In the 88th minute, Pulisic chested a McKennie pass while on the right flank, dribbled into the penalty area and crossed to Agyemang, who used his right instep to launch a close-range shot high over the crossbar.\n\nWith Fulham left back Antonee Robinson unavailable for the United States because of an unspecified injury, Pochettino started a three-man backline of Tim Ream, Joe Scally and Chris Richards, with Yunus Musah and Tim Weah serving as wingbacks. The United States began applying intense high pressure early and often, reducing Panama to long balls from the back or trying to generate offense by forcing turnovers.\n\nHowever, the United States failed to create a consistent attack. And when they did create chances, they couldn’t put them away. In the 20th minute, a Josh Sargent shot from 12 yards out deflected off the right leg of Panamanian defender Edgardo Fariña and the base of the right goalpost. Mosquera batted the ball away before Cristian Martínez cleared it. McKennie followed with a close-range header into Mosquera’s midsection.\n\n“You know, I think we definitely struggled with that in the first half,” Ream said, “and weren’t able to put enough pressure on them to cough up balls in areas that we felt that we could take advantage of.”\n\nPochettino expressed the situation more bluntly: “The first half, I think, was really painful, really painful to see.”",

        "title": "Dismantling of education department casts US student loans into uncertainty",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump ordered the dismantling of the US Department of Education on Thursday, prompting uncertainty for those holding student debt and questions about what happens next.\n\nTrump’s press secretary told reporters earlier on Thursday what remained of the department would continue to govern student debt.\n\n“The Department of Education will be much smaller than it is today,” Karoline Leavitt said. “When it comes to student loans and Pell grants those will still be run out of the Department of Education … any critical functions of the department will remain.”\n\nHer words echoed those of the department itself, which has said, while announcing a 50% staff cut earlier this month, it will “continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grant-making”.\n\nIn January, as the Biden administration ended, the education department said it had approved a total of $188.8bn in student loan forgiveness, affecting 5.3 million borrowers.\n\nBut according to Pew Research, one in four US adults under 40 (or more than 40 million adults) has student debt. The same source says median debt runs between $20,000 and $24,999, with median postgraduate debt about double those figures. Younger graduates, between 25 and 39, are more likely to say they are struggling financially than older graduates, though graduates still report higher income than those who do not complete college.\n\nMany observers doubt that whatever remains of the Department of Education will be properly equipped to manage student debt.\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian on Thursday, Sameer Gadkaree, the CEO of the Institute for College Access and Success, said: “Shuttering the Department of Education would prove disastrous for students, borrowers, and our nation’s future workforce. Without the department, fewer students would be able to go to college, student loan borrowers would default in droves, and fraudulent colleges would prey on students with impunity. Separately, gutting education research would curtail our ability to track progress on national educational goals.”\n\nGadkaree added: “The administration claims that it can avoid these harms by shifting the department’s functions to the states – which, like shuttering the department, would require congressional approval. But states cannot effectively administer federal student loans, send out grant aid to millions of students across thousands of colleges, or compile national data.”\n\nBeth Maglione, the interim president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said recently: “Claiming that eliminating half the department won’t affect its services – without any clear plan to redistribute the workload – is, at best, naive and, at worst, deliberately misleading.\n\n“It also raises serious concerns about how billions of dollars in federal student aid will continue to be disbursed to students without interruption.”\n\nEarlier this week, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) sued the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully shutting down access to income-driven student loan repayment plans – a step taken last month after a court ruled against Save, a Biden administration initiative to provide more generous terms than previous repayment plans.\n\nA department spokesperson said it was working to ensure the programs conform with the court ruling “and anticipates the revised form allowing borrowers to change repayment plans to be available as soon as next week”.\n\nSome observers do not think it is out of the question that student debt will not remain at the Trump Department of Education, but could be transferred to another department as Trump himself has suggested.\n\nMark Kantrowitz, a higher education expert, recently told CNBC that Trump could try to transfer student loans to the treasury or the Department of Commerce, though such moves might be stymied by a lack of expertise at those other bodies.\n\nSuch a move would in all likelihood lead to a period of bureaucratic disruption. Kantrowitz also warned that if student debt remains under the remit of whatever remains of the education department, borrowers may find existing loan forgiveness programs choked and stalled, with staff no longer able to cope.\n\nTrump is also seeking to limit the public service loan forgiveness program, on ideological grounds.\n\nAmid the chaos, CNBC said it was “important … to keep in mind” that “the terms and conditions of … federal student loans cannot change even if the agency overseeing them does”, because “borrowers’ rights were guaranteed when they signed the master promissory note when their loans were originated”.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration removed an online application form for multiple popular student debt repayment plans including income-driven repayment plans.\n\nThe administration also removed an online application for students to consolidate their plans on the Department of Education website.\n\nOn Tuesday, the AFT – a major teachers union in the US – filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education after the department prevented applications from being processed on affordable repayment plans for student loans.\n\nAccording to the complaint, ATF “brings this lawsuit to compel the department to abide by Congress’s command and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the affordable, income-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled”.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the lawsuit, Weingarten said: “By effectively freezing the nation’s student loan system, the new administration seems intent on making life harder for working people, including for millions of borrowers who have taken on student debt so they can go to college.”",

        "title": "‘Hannibal Lecter’ treatment of Luigi Mangione ‘backfired’, says fundraising organizer",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The organizer of an online campaign that has raised more than $700,000 for Luigi Mangione’s legal defense in connection with the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, believes the accused killer’s infamous, post-arrest “perp walk” may have “backfired” on New York authorities and spurred some of the financial support effort.\n\nIn remarks on an upcoming podcast exploring Mangione’s case, Sam Beard says the campaign eclipsed its goal by more than double after the public saw authorities “treating him like Hannibal Lecter”, referring to the fictional serial killer protagonist in The Silence of the Lambs film.\n\n“To just demonstrate the sheer power of this state and … to really just show how captured and how small this person is … a lot of us feel like that maybe backfired,” Beard says on Luigi, a four-episode Law & Crime podcast set to premiere on Monday – and an excerpt of which was shared with the Guardian.\n\nBeard’s comments are some of the most extensive yet about his work on the Luigi Mangione Official Defense Fund, which had raised about $748,000 as of Friday morning on the GiveSendGo platform.\n\nAs the podcast notes, critics of the campaign say it dangerously glorifies vigilante violence and disrespects the family of Thompson, whose killing on 4 December 2024 was seen by many as an extreme, illicit protest of both the US’s rapacious private health insurance industry and the wealthy executives who profit off routine coverage denials.\n\nYet Beard and those who have supported the Mangione fund launched by his December 4th Legal Committee counter that everyone deserves a fair trial, including him. And, as a high-profile defendant, Mangione is grappling with a disproportionately intense prosecution, they maintain.\n\nA clear instance of that, Beard says on the Law & Crime podcast, was when Mangione was extradited to New York from where he had been arrested in Pennsylvania. Beard alluded to the way dozens of New York police officers – including ones equipped with body armor and long guns – greeted a shackled Mangione at the helicopter in which he arrived and then escorted him to a waiting vehicle.\n\nThe group surrounding Mangione – clad in an orange prisoner’s jumpsuit – was joined by the New York mayor, Eric Adams, as television news cameras recorded the dramatic scene, unfolding about 15 days after the Thompson shooting.\n\n“We just saw how spectacular they really made that moment,” Beard remarks on the podcast.\n\nYet the show of strength did not isolate Mangione, who is facing state and federal charges of murder as well as terrorism – allegations which could mean the death penalty for him if he is convicted.\n\nBy late January, about 11,000 donors contributing roughly $30 each had helped the Mangione defense fund eclipse its initial goal of $300,000. That amount then more than doubled, prompting Beard’s group to increase the campaign’s goal to $1m.\n\nIn February, Mangione’s attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, announced that her client – who has pleaded not guilty in the case – would accept the money raised for his legal defense.\n\n“I know [that was] extremely meaningful to the well over 12,000 donors,” Beard says on the podcast. “I’m really grateful for the opportunity to help.”\n\nAuthorities allege that Mangione, 26, shot Thompson, 50, to death in plain view of a surveillance camera as he walked to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. A five-day manhunt led to Mangione’s arrest in a Pennsylvania McDonald’s.\n\nInvestigators say he had a gun that matched the one used to kill Thompson, fake identification that Mangione allegedly used to check into a New York City hostel before the deadly shooting, and a notebook expressing disdain for US healthcare companies’ practices.\n\nAccording to the insurer, Mangione was never a client of UnitedHealthcare. But he had cut himself off from friends and relatives in the months before his arrest, posting frequently in online forums about struggling with back pain – details which are examined on the Luigi podcast.\n\nA poll published in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most people in the US believe the health insurance’s frequent denials of coverage shared some responsibility for the death of Thompson, whose survivors include his widow and two teenage sons.\n\nBut the survey found most people in the US believed Thompson’s killer had either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of responsibility for his death.\n\n“It’s horrible when anybody has their life cut short by another person, especially when it could have been prevented,” Beard says on Mangione. “But the same logic has to apply both ways, right?\n\n“Preventing people from getting the healthcare that they need – that you and your company have access to and could provide them, but don’t do so because it would threaten your business model – that’s an act of violence too,” Beard says.",

        "content": "A veteran FBI agent who blew the whistle on alleged political bias during Donald Trump’s first presidency was arrested at New York’s JFK airport moments before boarding an international flight.\n\nJohnathan Buma, a 15-year counterintelligence officer and eventual whistleblower, now faces charges of illegally disclosing classified information through a prospective tell-all book about his career.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Buma systematically harvested confidential materials from the bureau’s internal systems, printing approximately 130 files clearly marked with security warnings in October 2023 before going on leave.\n\nHe allegedly shared draft portions of a book manuscript via email that contained information about “the FBI’s efforts and investigations into a foreign country’s weapons of mass destruction (‘WMD’) program”, the filing reads.\n\nDuring a Brooklyn federal court hearing on Tuesday, Buma was released on $100,000 bail, though the case will be handled in California federal court. He has not entered a plea.\n\nThe investigation into the FBI agent began during the Biden administration, when his home was raided in late 2023.\n\nThat year, Buma told Business Insider about what he described as differential treatment of politically sensitive cases. He described an incident during which he allegedly presented information about potential criminal actions involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to a supervisor at the Los Angeles field office – prompting his boss to advance the case. Then when he went to raise concerns in the same meeting that the former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani might have been compromised in a Russian counter-influence operation, Buma says his superior moved to immediately dismiss the matter altogether.\n\nIn a semi-redacted statement to the Senate in 2023, Buma explained how he was “at my wits’ end” and filed a whistleblower complaint in January 2022 alleging “numerous acts of intelligence suppression” related to his reporting on foreign intelligence matters. The complaint also claimed he faced retaliation for voicing his concerns, and he filed an Equal Employment Opportunities complaint later that year.\n\nFollowing the October 2023 raid on Buma’s home, his attorney Scott Horton denied any wrongdoing and claimed no classified information was found.",

        "content": "Federal authorities have taken into custody on Wednesday an alleged longtime leader of a Los Angeles street gang who investigators say ran a “mafia-like” criminal enterprise that included murder, human trafficking and extortion while he also worked as an entertainment entrepreneur, officials announced.\n\nEugene Henley Jr, known as “Big U”, was one of 18 members of the Rollin’ 60s Neighborhood Crips charged in a federal complaint with a litany of federal crimes including drug trafficking, conspiracy and firearms offenses, the United States attorney’s office said in a statement.\n\nBefore turning himself in on Wednesday, the self-described community activist recorded videos denying the accusations.\n\n\n\n“This the price of being Black and trying to help somebody, trying to help your community and do what you can,” Henley said. “You just guilty because somebody else don’t like you.”\n\n\n\nHis appearance in federal court was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, the federal prosecutors’ office said. The Associated Press could not locate an attorney for Henley.\n\nTen gang members were arrested this week while Henley, 58, and one other were initially considered fugitives, the statement said. The FBI announced on X on Wednesday evening that both had been taken into custody. Other defendants were already in custody.\n\nHenley allegedly masterminded a criminal operation that investigators dubbed the “Big U Enterprise”, and is also suspected of embezzling donations to Developing Options, an anti-gang charity he founded, but which prosecutors say he used “as a front for fraudulent purposes and to insulate its members from suspicion by law enforcement”.\n\nHe is suspected in the 2021 killing of an aspiring rap musician who was signed to his recording company, Uneek Music, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe rapper, identified in court documents as “RW”, was allegedly shot and killed by Henley after he recorded a “defamatory song” about the gang leader at a Las Vegas studio, prosecutors said. RW’s body was found in a ditch off Interstate 15 in the Nevada desert.\n\nProsecutors said Henley ran the enterprise like a mob boss and used his stature and longstanding association with the Rollin’ 60s and other street gangs to intimidate businesses and individuals in Los Angeles.\n\n“Not only did the enterprise expand its power through violence, fear, and intimidation, but it also used social media platforms, documentaries, podcasts, interviews, and Henley’s reputation and status as an ‘OG’ (original gangster) to create fame for – and stoke fear of – the Big U Enterprise, its members, and its associates,” the US attorney’s statement said.\n\nHenley is accused of organizing criminal activity including extortion, robbery, trafficking and exploiting sex workers, fraud, and illegal gambling. In addition, he’s suspected of submitting a fraudulent application for a Covid-19 pandemic relief loan for Uneek Music.",

        "content": "At least 91 Palestinians have been killed and many more injured in a third day of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to medical officials in the strip, who said a high proportion of the dead were women and children.\n\nThe timing of the strikes in the new Israeli offensive appears to have increased the proportion of women and children among the victims, with many sleeping when the missiles struck overnight or very early in the morning. Among those pulled alive from rubble on Thursday was a month-old baby girl, but her parents and brother were killed.\n\nA first wave of airstrikes on Tuesday shattered a two-month pause in hostilities and killed more than 400, according to the health ministry in Gaza, in what may have been the single bloodiest day of the 18-month conflict. The dead included 183 children and 94 women, Palestinian officials said.\n\nWarnings telling Palestinians to evacuate areas in the north and east of Gaza to avoid being trapped by fighting have been issued by the Israeli military, suggesting ground assaults could be imminent, although Israel appears to be relying on air power for now.\n\nThursday’s strikes appeared concentrated on the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis and the northern town of Beit Lahiya.\n\nA strike on a family home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village near Khan Younis, killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of the month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.\n\n1:17 Thousands of Israelis protest against resumption of Gaza war – video\n\nThe home was within an area covered by a recent evacuation order.\n\n“The house collapsed over the people’s heads,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors.\n\nThe European hospital in the southern city of Rafah said it had received 26 bodies after the overnight strikes, mostly women and children. The Nasser hospital in Khan Younis received the bodies of seven people killed in an attack on a home. In northern Gaza, the Indonesian hospital said it received the bodies of seven people killed in a strike in Beit Lahiya, a town near the border. A second strike in Beit Lahiya killed many mourners at a funeral, survivors said.\n\nA spokesperson for al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said 70% of the injured were women and children, most arriving in critical condition.\n\nZaher al-Wahidi, the director of the health information centre at the health ministry in Gaza, said the situation in all hospitals was catastrophic.\n\n“The injured are lying on the ground with blood covering the floors of the hospitals. We are suffering greatly from a shortage of supplies for emergency and intensive care, as well as for surgeries and medical equipment. There is a severe shortage of fuel stations, desalination stations, oxygen, and a critical shortage of fuel in the hospitals,” Wahidi said.\n\nIn its first military response to the Israeli offensive since the ceasefire was broken, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv in Israel. No casualties or damage were reported.\n\nLt Col Nadav Shoshani, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said earlier this week that Israel had attacked “terror targets and terrorists in Gaza … to weaken their military and governmental capabilities and remove threats to Israel”.\n\nIsraeli media have reported that the new air offensive is aimed at senior political and military Hamas officials, and have identified several killed, including the head of Hamas’s internal security agency.\n\nOn Wednesday the IDF reoccupied the Netzarim corridor, a key strip of land that divides Gaza into northern and southern halves.\n\nAs part of the ceasefire deal signed in January, Israel had withdrawn from the corridor, where it had demolished almost all existing buildings, widened a road and built a series of strongpoints.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Hatem Khaled/Reuters\n\nIsrael and Hamas blame each other for the collapse of the ceasefire, which had largely held since coming into effect in mid-January and had brought some respite for Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants.\n\nHamas, which still holds 59 of about 250 hostages it seized in the October 2023 attack into southern Israel that triggered the conflict, says it wants to conclude the three-phase ceasefire deal agreed after more than a year of indirect talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US. More than half of the hostages are thought to be dead.\n\nThe group said on Thursday that talks with mediators to halt the Israeli offensive were continuing, and called again for Israel to abide by the earlier agreement.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other Israel officials said the decision to renew attacks in Gaza came after Hamas rejected proposals for a 30-to 60-day extension of the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that Donald Trump backed Israel’s new offensive and blamed Hamas for the violence.\n\n“He fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they’ve taken in recent days,” Leavitt told reporters.\n\n“Let’s not forget that this situation is completely the fault of Hamas when they launched that brutal attack on Israel on 7 October, and the president has made it very clear that he wants all of those hostages to come home.”\n\nSirens sounded across much of Israel at 4am on Thursday to warn of an incoming missile launched by the Yemen-based Houthi militia. The missile was intercepted by Israel’s air-defence system.\n\nThe Hamas surprise attack in 2023 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, also mostly civilians.\n\nCritics in Israel have accused Netanyahu of resuming the offensive to reinforce his coalition government before a crucial budget vote in parliament, to rally support for the war in the face of popular backing for a ceasefire to return the hostages, and to head off widespread public anger over his attempt to fire the head of the internal security service, Shin Bet.\n\nUnderlining the deep divisions in Israel, hundreds of Israelis protested outside Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem on Thursday. Police used a water cannon after some tried to break through barricades. More demonstrations were planned on Thursday.",

On Truth Social, the president linked to a story in UK tabloid the Sun, which says: KING Charles will reportedly make a “secret offer” to Donald Trump during his State visit. The Royal proposal is said to potentially reduce tensions between the White House and Canada. Plans are allegedly in the works to make the USA the next “associate member” of the Commonwealth. The international association, which currently boasts 56 states, could welcome the US as a new member. In February, a Tariff war began between the two countries with Trump signing orders to impose near-universal tariffs on goods from Canada entering the United States. The US President revealed Canada could avoid higher taxes if it joined the United States of America as its 51 state. Canada, of which the King is head of state, is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and including America may dampen the current conflict. To which Trump responded: I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me! But trade tensions with Canada are likely to grow worse on 2 April, when an exemption from 25% tariffs he imposed on the country expires.

Justice department attorneys have been in a legal standoff with James Boasberg, a federal judge who over the weekend told the Trump administration not to allow three planes carrying suspected Venezuelan gang members to fly to El Salvador. The planes arrived anyway, and Boasberg has since been demanding details of the aircrafts’ itineraries to determine if his order was violated. The justice department has said the Trump administration may determine the information is a “state secret” that it cannot reveal to the judge. Yesterday, Boasberg demanded that the administration have “a person with direct involvement in the Cabinet-level discussions” submit a declaration. That declaration has now arrived, from Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general, who confirmed his “direct involvement in ongoing Cabinet-level discussions regarding invocation of the state-secrets privilege.” The government now has until next Tuesday to decide whether to invoke the privilege.

Boasberg had given the administration until noon Thursday to either provide more details about the flights or make a claim that they must be withheld because they would harm “state secrets”. The administration resisted the judge’s request, calling it an “unnecessary judicial fishing” expedition.

Pomerantz once likened the president to a mob boss.\n\nTo avoid the consequences of Trump’s order, the White House said, the firm had agreed to “take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society”. The firm reportedly agreed to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions and to dedicate the equivalent of $40m in free legal services to support Trump administration policies on issues including assistance for veterans and countering antisemitism.\n\nThe firm, the White House claimed, also acknowledged the wrongdoing of Pomerantz, the partner involved in the investigation into Trump’s hush-money payments to an adult film actor. It was unclear whether Karp was aware of that claim.\n\nIn a statement issued by the White House, Karp said: “We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.”\n\nThe firm becomes the latest corporate target to make concessions to the president to avoid his ire.\n\nMeta and ABC made settlement payments to Trump’s future presidential library to end lawsuits filed by Trump.

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "There’s an interesting trend in the electric bike industry: Car manufacturers are getting in on the action. One of the latest examples is the Ford Bronco eBike, a motocross-inspired ride that’s so distinctive in appearance that it made everyone from passing drivers to bike mechanics to nostalgic Ford Bronco fans do a double take.\n\nWith an aerodynamic seat suspended over the back wheel and a beefy aluminum frame, the Bronco could be mistaken for a motocross bike. On the other hand, the integrated cockpit with an analog speedometer, plus an enormous headlight that outputs 2000 lumens, makes it feel sort of like a car. Then again, with a 190 x 50 mm rear-coil shock and nubby Pirelli Scorpion Enduro tires, it’s also reminiscent of an enduro mountain bike. Given this mashup, I was curious to see how the thing would ride.\n\nPhotograph: Ford\n\nThrottle Only\n\nThe nearly 68-pound bike has a 750-watt motor (with 85 newton meters of torque) that sits in the rear hub. It offers four power modes: Eco, Normal, Sport, and Baja, the last of which is likely a nod to the kind of riding the bike’s designers envisioned—dirt trails and dunes.\n\nThe Bronco comes in Class II and III versions. The one I tested was Class II, meaning that it is pedal-assist and has a throttle that the rider can control without pedaling. (Class II bikes have a maximum speed limit of 20 miles per hour, but this bike’s speedometer tops out at 40 mph.) The 750 watt-hour battery, permanently tucked into the bike’s beefy down tube, promised a 60-mile range in optimal conditions.\n\nThese stats are about average for enduro-style e-bikes, but I’ve ridden some that are 10 pounds lighter, with 15 newton meters more torque (the higher the torque, the greater the motor’s power and responsiveness). So while the bike looked powerful, I wondered if it actually was.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Katie Drummond: Right, available to the public, as opposed to DOGE, despite the claims that Musk and even President Trump have made, that this is a maximally transparent group of people doing this work. We don't actually know that much about what they're doing, what they're finding, and the changes that they're making, short of journalists like you and so many of your WIRED colleagues and other news organizations obtaining that information and publishing it. Now, I want to back up a little bit because at the heart of all of this is this notion of fraud, of waste, of financial abuse. It's something that Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed is widespread, pervasive across government agencies that there is fraudulent spending, there is excessive waste happening. There is abuse of financial power, financial authority on the part of these agencies. Now, from what you've reported over the last several months and in your role, how valid is that claim to begin with?\n\nVittoria Elliott: There was a report from the government accountability office that covered the years 2018 to 2022, and that found that there's actually over $200 billion of waste, fraud, or abuse that happens. So it's like, it's not this made-up thing, but in the context of a $7 trillion federal budget, that is not what's breaking the bank. I don't think anyone, Democrat or Republican, DOGE fan or not, would argue that, hey, that's a problem that we need to solve. That's a very valuable thing. But one of the auditors that I spoke to basically said DOGE could go look at the current recommendations from the IGs. They could go look at the current outstanding investigations. They could pick up that work if they are really dedicated to this because there actually are systems, and there actually are reports about this. But from what the auditors I spoke to said, they said that doesn't really seem to be what DOGE is doing. And one of the other things they said was a lot of auditors would probably be really happy to help them, to offer advice. They'd be happy to work with them, they'd be happy to bring young talent into their teams to sort of make the auditing system more robust. But DOGE is really kind of siloed, it doesn't seem like they're really interested in that.\n\nKatie Drummond: Right. Now, speaking of DOGE and the auditors that you spoke to for this story, they certainly didn't have kind words to say about how DOGE is going about its work. Tell us a little bit more about their impressions of DOGE and their commentary on sort of what is happening under the auspices of this idea that Musk and DOGE are essentially auditing the federal government. What do the actual auditors think about that?\n\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, so to give some context, first off, a regular audit, which involves like five different steps, so there are five steps to an audit. One is where you plan it, you sit down, you say, \"This is what we're looking at, this is the kind of information we're going to need to go after.\" You sort of map out who the stakeholders are, who you're going to have to interview, because a lot of times they're going into programs or systems that maybe they don't fully understand. So, it's almost a little ethnographic. You got to go in, you got to interview people, you got to be like, \"What is your job? What does this connect to? What does this mean inside your system?\" You have to do that baseline understanding of getting to know the program or the agency. Then you do the actual field work, which is, you go out, you talk to people. In the case of, for instance, the hurricane stuff, they actually sent auditors, I believe, to Puerto Rico to see what was going on. You go into the systems, you do that kind of human on the ground legwork. Once you've done that, they sort of pull all this information together into a report, they sort of do this analysis. They talk to the agencies, they say like, \"Hey, these are the problems we found. You have the opportunity to correct these. These are our recommendations.\" And then they submit that to the agencies, to Congress, and then they get to follow up. They get to come back and be like, \"Hey, we recommended this thing. Did you fix this problem?\" There's a level of accountability for trying to fix that thing. So, there are very clear understandings within the government of what the best practice of this is, and all of these people do that. That takes six to 18 months.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has to date been enlisted as a bogeyman in cultural circles: Software will take the jobs of writers and translators, and AI-generated images ring the death toll for illustrators and graphic designers.\n\nYet there’s a corner of high culture where AI is taking on a starring role as hero, not displacing the traditional protagonists—art experts and conservators—but adding a powerful, compelling weapon to their arsenal when it comes to fighting forgeries and misattributions. AI is already exceptionally good at recognizing and authenticating an artist’s work, based on the analysis of a digital image of a painting alone.\n\nAI’s objective analysis has thrown a wrench into this traditional hierarchy. If an algorithm can determine the authorship of an artwork with statistical probability, where does that leave the old-guard art historians whose reputations have been built on their subjective expertise? In truth, AI will never replace connoisseurs, just as the use of x-rays and carbon dating decades ago did not. It is simply the latest in a line of high-tech tools to assist with authentication.\n\nA good AI must be “fed” a curated dataset by human art historians to build up its knowledge of an artist’s style, and human art historians must interpret the results. Such was the case in November 2024, when a leading AI firm, Art Recognition, published its analysis of Rembrandt’s The Polish Rider—a painting that famously confounded scholars and led to many arguments as to how much, if any of it, had actually been painted by Rembrandt himself. The AI precisely matched what most connoisseurs had posited about which parts of the painting were by the master, which were by students of his, and which involved the hand of over-enthusiastic restorers. It is particularly compelling when the scientific approach confirms the expert opinion.\n\nWe humans find hard scientific data more compelling than personal opinion, even when that opinion comes from someone who seems to be an expert. The so-called “CSI effect” describes how jurors perceive DNA evidence as more persuasive than even eyewitness testimony. But when expert opinion (the eyewitnesses), provenance, and scientific tests (the CSI) all agree on the same conclusion? That’s as close to a definitive answer as one can get.\n\nBut what happens when the owner of a work that, at first glance, looks totally inauthentic to the point of being laughable, recruits a slick firm with the task of gathering forensic evidence to support a preferable attribution?\n\nLost and Found\n\nBack in 2016, an oil painting surfaced at a flea market in Minnesota and was bought for less than $50. Now its owners are suggesting that it could be a lost Van Gogh, and therefore would be worth millions. (One estimate suggests $15 million.) The answer—at least to anyone with functioning eyeballs and a passing familiarity with art history—was a resounding “nah.” The painting is stiff, clumsy, utterly lacking the feverish impasto and rhythmic brushwork that define the Dutch artist’s oeuvre. Worse still, it bore a signature: Elimar. And yet, this dubious painting has become the center of a high-stakes battle for authenticity, one in which scientific analysis, market forces, and wishful thinking collide.\n\nThe owners of the “Elimar Van Gogh,” as it has come to be derisively known in art circles, are now an art consultancy group called LMI International. They are investing heavily in getting experts to say what they want to hear: that it is, in fact, a genuine Van Gogh. This is where things get murky. The world of art authentication is not a straightforward affair. Unlike the hard sciences, art history deals in probabilities, connoisseurship, and competing expert opinions. It is also, crucially, an industry driven by financial incentives. If the painting is deemed real, its value skyrockets. If it’s deemed a fake, or rather in this case a derivative work by someone named Elimar who daubed a bit on canvas, distantly inspired by Van Gogh perhaps, but with none of his talents, it's virtually worthless—about as valuable as you might expect to find at a flea market in Minnesota for under 50 bucks. This imbalance in stakes has led to a dangerous trend: hiring experts not to determine authenticity, but to affirm it.",

        "title": "High Thread Count Doesn’t Really Matter",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "At some point during the ’90s, the trend of marketing high-thread-count bedsheets as a higher-quality option took off. It's easy to see why you could fall for it: Higher-thread-count sheets often feel soft and silky, with a nice weight to them thanks to all the piled-on threads. More fabric must be better and last longer, right? But while thread count does affect the density and feel of that fabric, it doesn't necessarily make it a great bedsheet, or a longer-lasting one.\n\nPart of that is the heat component. “It’s pure physics,\" says Kristie Rhodes, manager of woven product development at Cotton Incorporated. “The less yarns you have in an area, the more open areas you have for the air to move through.” Staying too hot at night is a major sleep disrupter, since you need to be able to lower your body heat in order to fall asleep. Heavier bedsheets won't help you at all in that aspect, no matter if they're bamboo or linen. Trust me—I've tried every kind of bed sheet, and nothing can fix bad airflow on a set of sheets if you're a hot sleeper.\n\nThread count can also be a misleading form of measurement. “Manufacturers can manipulate thread count using thinner threads, so it's important to consider multiple aspects of sheet quality beyond just the number of threads,\" says Phoebe Yu, founder and CEO of Ettitude, maker of bamboo home textiles like sheets, towels, and even rugs. Parima Ijaz, founder of Pure Parima, which specializes in Egyptian cotton sheets, agrees and recommends prioritizing the material over the thread count.\n\nBut material quality can be difficult for shoppers to gauge unless they're deeply entrenched in where businesses are sourcing their fabrics from, and have both time and energy to research it. (Or are reading in-depth sheets reviews like you'll find here on WIRED.) It's another clear reason why thread count is such a memorable yardstick for shoppers: It's a nice, clean number shoppers can look at and feel they've discerned quality.\n\nThread Count, Explained\n\nPhotograph: Richard-I'Anson/Getty Images\n\nThread count isn't counting all the threads in the entire bedsheet, but rather one small area. “[It] refers to the total number of threads woven into each square inch of fabric and is calculated by adding horizontal and vertical weft threads together to create the total number of threads per square inch; i.e., your thread count number,\" says Zoe Doyle, the associate brand manager of Mulberry Park Silks.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Over the past decade, encrypted communication has become the norm for billions of people. Every day, Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp keep billions of messages, photos, videos, and calls private by using end-to-end encryption by default—while Zoom, Discord, and various other services all have options to enable the protection. But despite the technology’s mainstream rise, long-standing threats to weaken encryption keep piling up.\n\nOver the past few months, there has been a surge in government and law enforcement efforts that would effectively undermine encryption, privacy advocates and experts say, with some of the emerging threats being the most “blunt” and aggressive of those in recent memory. Officials in the UK, France, and Sweden have all made moves since the start of 2025 that could undermine or eliminate the protections of end-to-end encryption, adding to a multiyear European Union plan to scan private chats and Indian efforts that could damage encryption.\n\nThese latest assaults on encryption come as intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials in the United States have recently backtracked on years of anti-encryption attitudes and now recommend that people use encrypted communication platforms whenever they can. The drastic shift in attitude followed the China-backed Salt Typhoon hacker group’s widespread breach of major US telecoms, and it comes as the second Trump administration ramps up potential surveillance of millions of undocumented migrants living in the US. Simultaneously, the administration has been straining longtime, crucial international intelligence-sharing agreements and partnerships.\n\n“The trend is bleak,” says Carmela Troncoso, a longtime privacy and cryptography researcher and the scientific director at the Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Germany. “We see these new policies coming up as mushrooms trying to undermine encryption.”\n\nEnd-to-end encryption is designed so only the sender and receiver of messages have access to their contents—governments, tech companies, and telecom providers can’t snoop on what people are saying. Those privacy and security guarantees have made encryption a target for law enforcement and governments for decades, because officials claim that the protection makes it prohibitively difficult to investigate urgent threats such as child sexual abuse material and terrorism.\n\nAs a result, governments around the world have frequently proposed technical mechanisms to bypass encryption and allow access to messages for investigations. Cryptographers and technologists have repeatedly and definitively warned, though, that any backdoor created to access end-to-end encrypted communications could be exploited by hackers or authoritarian governments, compromising everyone’s safety. Additionally, it is likely that criminals would find ways to continue to use self-made encryption tools to conceal their messages, meaning that backdoors in mainstream products would succeed at undermining protections for the public without eliminating its use by bad actors.\n\nBroadly, the recent threats to encryption have come in three forms, says Namrata Maheshwari, the encryption policy lead at international nonprofit Access Now. First, there are those where governments or law enforcement agencies are asking for backdoors to be built into encrypted platforms to gain “lawful access” to content. At the end of February, for example, Apple pulled its encrypted iCloud backup system, called Advanced Data Protection, from use in the UK after the country’s lawmakers reportedly hit the Cupertino company with a secret order demanding Apple provide access to encrypted files. To do so, Apple would have had to create a backdoor. The order, which has been criticized by the Trump administration, is set to be challenged in a secret court hearing on March 14.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "At least 10 people associated with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are now working at the Social Security Administration, according to government records reviewed by WIRED; this includes a number of young engineers whose presence at the SSA has not been reported. The ballooning of DOGE’s presence at the federal agency—which Bloomberg, citing sworn statements filed in federal court Wednesday, previously reported—comes as Musk and his cohorts are publicly threatening social security benefits, citing unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud.\n\nThe DOGE-affiliated personnel in question are currently listed in the agency’s internal organizational chart. Background checks for two are still pending, according to a filing by the SSA in federal court in Maryland opposing a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by unions that would prevent DOGE from accessing SSA records. (A sworn statement attached to the filing from the SSA’s deputy commissioner of human resources claims that six of the background checks are still pending.)\n\nThe operatives—whom the government did not name in its filing—are, according to internal documents, Akash Bobba, Scott Coulter, Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, Antonio Gracias, Gautier Cole Killian, Jon Koval, Nikhil Rajpal, Payton Rehling, and Ethan Shaotran. This team appears to be among the largest DOGE units deployed to any government agency.\n\nTen of the DOGE-affiliated staffers are listed as part of the same group within Microsoft Teams, which SSA employees use for internal communication, according to a screenshot shared with WIRED. They are listed as “IT Specialists” based at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, except for Bobba, who is listed as “Front Office” in the office of the chief information officer (CIO).\n\nMany of them have worked or interned at Musk companies such as Tesla and Space X, and the majority of them have also appeared at other government agencies in recent weeks, as part of DOGE’s incursion into the government. Musk has made wild claims about the social security system, calling it a “Ponzi scheme” and falsely claiming that millions of 150-year-olds were fraudulently collecting benefits.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 and davidgilbert.01.\n\nAccording to the SSA court filing and accompanying sworn statements, seven of them have read-only access to several datasets including the Master Beneficiary Record, which contains detailed information about individuals and their benefits. Those same DOGE representatives also have read-only access to Numident, a database containing information about everyone who’s ever applied for a Social Security number, as well as data referred to as “Treasury Payment Files Showing SSA Payments from SSOARS.” (The Social Security Online Accounting and Reporting System is a set of systems containing “information on the SSA’s financial position and operations,” according to the SSA.)\n\nThese records contain a great deal of personally identifying and financial information; in filings the government says DOGE accessing them is necessary to “detect fraud.”\n\nWhile it’s been unclear even to well-placed insiders what specifically DOGE is doing inside the Social Security Administration, Musk has repeatedly voiced his desire to “eliminate” large parts of the system in the US, recently claiming that the fact that there are more Social Security numbers than there are US citizens—a well-known quirk of the SSA system—“might be the biggest fraud in history.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "After the October hearing, the families joined Pierson and Jacobsen at a Mexican restaurant. A boom mic from a documentary crew hovered above Pierson’s head. Jacobsen pulled out a suitcase from under the table, and Pierson handed out glass awards, from their foundation, honoring the families’ leadership on aviation safety. Pierson improvised a speech for each one.\n\nChris Moore thought, well, this was unexpected. “You don’t think, oh, I can’t wait to get an award someday.” But at this point in the awful five-year battle that he never wanted, “shaking my fist at the clouds,” as he put it, a token for the Zoom group’s efforts felt nice. Moore knows that all this fact-finding and accountability-seeking serves another purpose, too: to help protect him from his bottomless grief.\n\nPierson still wrestles with his own grief, a wholly different kind. Could he have done more to prevent the crashes? “I don’t think I’ll ever—” He lets out a long exhale. “I’ll ever stop feeling that way.”\n\nListening, I thought about something Doug Pasternak, the lead investigator of the Max report, told me about his conversations with Pierson. “He was devastated. He did have a sense of, ‘guilt’ may not be the word, but responsibility. He just wishes there was something that could have been done to prevent these horrific accidents.”\n\nPierson couldn’t prevent the crashes, although no one I spoke to thought he could have done more. But he could become the guy hellbent on not letting another Max fall from the sky. He could hunch over every report to work out possible explanations in an RV kitchenette. He could be the fired-up guy pushing authorities to look—no really, look—under every last Boeing rock. If a corporate and regulatory culture of yes-men and -women led to the deaths of 346 people, then Pierson will happily be the nope man, awarding no benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe new documents, with all their promise of bringing home Pierson’s contested electrical theory, ended up amounting to less than he’d hoped. The NTSB told Pierson it wouldn’t hand the papers to the Max crash investigators—the cases had concluded, the board said—but he could do so himself.\n\nBoeing wobbles in limbo, before civil and criminal courts, at the FAA, in Congress, awaiting the final door-plug report from the NTSB. Observers say 2025 will be Boeing’s pivotal year: The company either turns around under its new CEO or succumbs to a doom loop. Pierson vows to keep talking.\n\n“For me, it was always about not allowing them to shut me up,” he says. Recently, the foundation received its first donations and now has a payroll. They’re starting to monitor other aircraft models and are talking with a university about analyzing industry-wide data—“to be an equal-opportunity pain in the butt,” Pierson says. The guy Boeing surely hoped would go away by now has, instead, institutionalized himself to stick around.\n\nWhen Pierson said goodbye to me in DC, his parting words were: “Don’t fly the Max.” I couldn’t bring myself to tell him. That’s exactly what I was booked on, the 7:41 pm from Dulles to San Francisco. It was the one I could catch after the whistleblower event on Capitol Hill and still walk into my house that night. Commercial flight was supposed to be about convenience, after all, collapsing a country’s span into a Tuesday night commute. At this point in aviation history, we passengers should be able to pick a flight on time alone.\n\nHurtling through the air that evening in seat 10C, I read the US House committee’s Max investigation, a disruptor of illusions. Like many fliers, I’d long ago made my bargain with risk. I’d taken comfort in statistics, summoned faith in the engineers and assembly workers, the pilots, the system. I’d shunted away the knowledge—paralyzing, if you let it in—that stepping on an airplane is an extraordinary act of trust. Deep in the report, I reached the part about a senior manager at Boeing’s factory in Renton, a guy named Ed Pierson, who seemingly knew what we all know when we soothe ourselves by thinking, They wouldn’t let it fly if it weren’t safe. We’re all relying on someone to be the “they.”\n\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

        "title": "How to Protect Your Cats (and Backyard Chickens) From Bird Flu",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "A nationwide egg shortage has sent prices soaring at your local grocery store—and the culprit is H5N1 bird flu. The virus has infected poultry flocks in every US state, with more than 166 million chickens having been killed by the virus or culled to contain it. H5N1 is also spreading among cattle, with close to 1,000 US dairy herds affected, and is suspected to be widespread among wild birds.\n\nBut these aren’t the only animals at risk. Domestic cats are particularly susceptible to catching the virus, which can be fatal in felines, while the rising trend of keeping backyard chickens—partly in response to the egg shortage—risks driving up cases further. Pets and backyard flocks can catch the virus from infected birds, alive or dead, as well as from droppings, contaminated surfaces, and contaminated food.\n\nThe reported number of US pets impacted by bird flu is relatively low, but cases of H5N1 in domestic cats are rising across the country. As of March 12, there have been 115 cases recorded in pet cats, across 20 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture. However, many cases in pets are probably being missed. “We are likely seeing an undercount of cases of H5 bird flu in pets, as not all sick pets with a possible epidemiologic link or exposure are reported to Veterinary Public Health,” says Jamie Middleton, director of veterinary public health and chief veterinarian at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “As a result, not all cases are tested.”\n\nCost of testing is an additional barrier to getting an accurate picture of how widespread pet infections are. “Commercial PCR lab testing for influenza at veterinary clinics is very costly, approximately $200 to $300 for a respiratory PCR panel for dogs and cats,” Middleton says. “Thus, many pet owners may elect to not test if their pet is experiencing respiratory symptoms.”\n\nBird flu can also be missed during testing if an infected animal isn’t shedding the virus at the time they were tested, making it difficult to pinpoint just how widespread the virus is among pets.\n\nThe Risks to Your Cat\n\n“We have known for years that cats are susceptible to influenza, and it’s on top of many people’s minds now because they can die from it,” says Sandra Faeh, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Cats, specifically those that go outside, are particularly at risk because of their exposure to potentially sick birds.\n\nCats are also becoming infected by being fed raw food—either homemade or commercially available—as well as unpasteurized milk. Two cats in Oregon recently died of avian influenza after having been fed raw food produced by the company Northwest Naturals. These deaths prompted a voluntary recall of raw pet food by the company.\n\nNorthwest Naturals did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nFaeh says that the best thing to do to protect your cat is to keep them inside and away from wildlife. Middleton of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health also advises people to avoid “feeding raw or undercooked meat and poultry products, raw milk or raw dairy products, and raw pet food diets to their pets.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.\n\n“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”\n\nThe memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.\n\nThe memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Since then a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department.\n\nThe plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard.\n\nFew blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary.\n\n“It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”\n\nGiulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. “There’s no proven advantage that it’s cheaper or better,” he says. “The way it’s been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\n\nThere have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ran a small pilot to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been tested in Kenya by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS).",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "I learned how to lift in college when I was running track, and I fell in love with the feeling of a heavy dead lift, squat, and clean. I’ve been lifting for the last decade, but it’s never been the same since I lost access to my elite college weight room. I mostly work out at home with adjustable dumbbells and kettlebells, but I’ve reached a point where I need something heavier. I need my barbell and plates back.\n\nSo I was stoked to review the Speediance Gym Monster 2, a magnetic-resistance cable machine that looks a lot like a normal weight-lifting rack but can fit in my home. I’ve been using it for a month now, and I’ve totally integrated it into my workout routine. I really enjoy using it (I didn’t love the past magnetic-resistance machine I tried), and it’s allowed me to step up my big lifts, like dead lifts, squats, and bench presses.\n\nPhotograph: Kristin Canning\n\nTricked Out\n\nThe Gym Monster 2 is a magnetic-resistance cable machine with a rack, screen, foldable platform (with a removable squishy pad), and so. Many. Accessories. The standard package comes with a bench, adjustable barbell, barbell hooks, barbell pad, tricep rope, cable handles, extender belt, ankle straps, and a Bluetooth ring and clip (more on what that does later). This is the second version (duh) and is more compact and lighter then the first iteration, and has one higher level for the cables on the rack pillars.\n\nIt was really easy to set up—no assembly required. It has a small footprint. When folded, it’s 14.6 inches long by 27.2 wide by 72.8 tall; unfolded, it’s 48.0 inches long. With a total resistance of 220 pounds, it can’t help you with your heaviest lifting, but the smart features and easy-to-use system make it a really cool home workout machine.\n\nPrice-wise, it’s a little less than the Tonal 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and you also don’t need to subscribe to a membership to access most of the workouts.\n\nPhotograph: Kristin Canning\n\nThere’s a lot to love about the Gym Monster 2. It feels much more like a traditional weight-lifting rack than other magnetic-resistance cable machines I’ve used in the past, thanks to the two tall pillars that can hold the cables. Similar machines, like the Vitruvian Trainer+ that I’ve tried, have cables that attach only to the platform, which makes certain lifts and positioning quite challenging.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the US astronauts stranded for nine months on the International Space Station, finally made it home on Tuesday, March 18. They returned to Earth with the two members of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission—NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Roscosmos—aboard SpaceX's Dragon Freedom spacecraft.\n\nThe four crew successfully splashed down off the coast of Florida at 5:57 pm EDT. Teams aboard SpaceX recovery craft boarded Dragon Freedom and assisted the crew. The astronauts were then flown to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston to be reunited with their families.\n\nSunita Lyn “Suni” Williams, 59, and Barry Eugene “Butch” Wilmore, 62, lifted off on June 5, 2024, on a mission to test Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft designed to transport crew to and from the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit. The astronauts had not planned to spend more than two weeks in space, but technical issues with Starliner thwarted that plan.\n\nAs it approached the space station, some of Starliner’s thrusters stopped working. Although the Boeing spacecraft managed to dock at the ISS, NASA preferred not to take any risks with its return and opted to send Starliner back to Earth without crew on board. The spacecraft landed safely in September.\n\nWhile Williams and Wilmore’s extended stay in space was unplanned, they had trained for potentially having to stay on the ISS for a number of months. Both also have extensive experience in space expeditions, including previous stays in the ISS.\n\nIn order for the astronauts to return home, NASA decided to send only two astronauts instead of four on the subsequent SpaceX mission. Williams and Wilmore would travel back to Earth in the two vacant seats in the SpaceX vehicle. After some delays, that mission—Crew-9, with Hague and Gorbunov on board—lifted off on September 28, 2024, bound for the ISS.\n\nBut this didn’t mark the end of Williams and Wilmore’s stay on the space station. It was still necessary to wait for the next mission to arrive at the ISS in order to leave the space station with an adequate number of personnel to operate it. So even after Crew-9 had arrived, Williams and Wilmore had to wait for the arrival of Crew-10—which did not happen until March 14—to be free to return to Earth.\n\nWhile the stranded astronauts were prepared for these inconveniences, their condition became a political issue between the administrations of US presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX and a leading figure in the second Trump administration, accused the Biden administration of abandoning the astronauts on the ISS. Shortly after being inaugurated, President Trump asked Musk to return the stranded astronauts as soon as possible.\n\n“PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to\n\n@ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!” the official White House account posted on X on Tuesday after the splashdown.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Suni, Butch, Nick, and Aleksandr home after their monthslong mission conducting vital science, technology demonstrations, and maintenance aboard the International Space Station,” said NASA acting dministrator Janet Petro in a statement. “Per President Trump’s direction, NASA and SpaceX worked diligently to pull the schedule a month earlier. This international crew and our teams on the ground embraced the Trump administration’s challenge of an updated, and somewhat unique, mission plan, to bring our crew home.”\n\nAccording to NASA, Williams and Wilmore traveled 195 million kilometers during their mission, spent 286 days in space, and completed 4,576 orbits around Earth.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.\n\nLanzone’s résumé confirms that. In 2001 he took over a sagging search property called AskJeeves—its share price was less than a dollar, down from a high of $196—and built it back to the point where Barry Diller’s IAC Corp bought it for $1.85 billion. At CBS Interactive and then CBS’s chief digital office during the 2010s, he yanked the stuffy Tiffany network into the streaming age. Yahoo, celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, might be his biggest challenge yet. Its history is pocked with missed opportunities, which explains in part why a public company once worth well over $100 billion was sold to a private equity firm for $5 billion in 2021. Yahoo famously passed on buying Google, and actually got Mark Zuckerberg to tentatively agree to sell Facebook for $1 billion before then CEO Terry Semel asked to renegotiate, which squelched the deal. Talent that walked out Yahoo’s door included the founders of WhatsApp. Promising acquisitions like Flickr, Tumblr and Huffington Post were ditched at fire-sale prices. In recent years Yahoo was a low-priority property for its owner, Verizon. Instead of trying to revive its purple glory, it merged Yahoo's assets with those of another failed icon, AOL, and dubbed the new brand Oath.\n\nSome pegged Lanzone’s chances at zero. “It’s hard to believe anyone else on the planet wants any part of his role, “ wrote George Bradt, one of those MBA types who churn out content for Forbes. Lanzone saw something different. In his view, Yahoo was an unacknowledged gem. “If you were able to take the name Yahoo off of it and look at the business in 2021, you saw billions in revenue,” he says.\n\nLanzone has little patience for exhuming past blunders. “I think the story of Yahoo's missed opportunities is tired,” he says. “It's boring.” Instead of crying over lost search glory, Lanzone concentrated on improving what Yahoo did. “We didn’t have to worry about what we weren’t,” he says. He got rid of money-losing units, like some nonperforming ad tech divisions, and quietly made some acquisitions to bolster the best properties, like Wagr, a sports betting app, to bring Yahoo Sports into the gambling age. He also brought in capable executives like former ESPN digital head Ryan Spoon, who now heads Yahoo Sports. He’s boosted profits and grown the company’s audience to the point where he says that Yahoo has performed the quickest return of any Apollo acquisition. Since Yahoo is private, the actual financials aren’t available. But Yahoo’s comms team provided me with a lengthy document packed with data to bolster Lanzone’s claim that Yahoo still has something to yodel about. Comscore, a marketing company that measures traffic, ranks Yahoo No. 1 in news, No. 1 in finance, and No. 3 in sports. It’s second only to Gmail in mail. He tells me that in the US alone, “hundreds of millions” of people use Yahoo every month.\n\nA year after Lanzone took the job, the entire tech world was turned around by the appearance of ChatGPT. In previous transformations like search, social, and mobile, Yahoo has a near-perfect record of botching these moments. Lanzone says Yahoo won’t be creating its own language models or dropping $100 billion on data centers, but he believes the company will seize the moment nonetheless. “I’d like to automate the word ‘AI’ so I don’t have to say it so much,” he says. Yahoo has in-house machine-learning talent and draws on outside companies for AI technology. For instance, it partners with the startup Sierra for robot customer service agents.\n\nOne of Lanzone’s canniest AI moves was acquiring Artifact, the AI-powered news aggregator created by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. When the pair decided it would not become a viable business, they announced its closure and Lanzone was among multiple suitors vying for the underlying technology. It became the centerpiece of the homepage that Yahoo relaunched earlier this year. “Instead of incorporating their technology into our product, we did it the other way,” Lanzone says. “Essentially Yahoo News is now Artifact.” Systrom approves. “We partnered with Yahoo because they made a strong offer, but also because they planned on deploying our hard work to many millions of people,” he says.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On Thursday, Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration, hosted his first all-hands meeting with GSA staff since his appointment to the position by President Donald Trump. The auditorium was packed, with hundreds of employees attending the meeting in person and thousands more tuning in online. While the tone of the live event remained polite, the chat that accompanied the live stream was a different story.\n\n“‘My door is always open’ but we’ve been told we can’t go to the floor you work on?” wrote one employee, according to Google Meet chat logs for the event obtained by WIRED. Employees used their real names to ask questions, but WIRED has chosen not to include those names to protect the privacy of the staffers. “We don’t want an AI demo, we want answers to what is going on with [reductions in force],” wrote another, as over 100 GSA staffers added a “thumbs up” emoji to the post.\n\nBut an AI demo is what they got. During the meeting, Ehikian and other high-ranking members of the GSA team showed off GSAi, a chatbot tool built by employees at the Technology Transformation Services. In its current form, the bot is meant to help employees with mundane tasks like writing emails. But Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been pushing for a more complex version that could eventually tap into government databases. Roughly 1,500 people have access to GSAi today, and by tomorrow, the bot will be deployed to more than 13,000 GSA employees, WIRED has learned.\n\nMusk associates—including Ehikian and Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who now runs the Technology Transformation Services within GSA—have put AI at the heart of their agenda. Yesterday, GSA hosted a media roundtable to show its AI tool to reporters. “All information shared during this event is on deep background—attributable to a ‘GSA official familiar with the development of the AI tool,’” an invite read. (Reporters from Bloomberg, The Atlantic, and Fox were invited. WIRED was not.)\n\nGSA was one of the first federal agencies Musk’s allies took over in late January, WIRED reported. Ehikian, who is married to a former employee of Elon Musk’s X, works alongside Shedd and Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk’s transition team at the company. Hollander is married to Steve Davis, who has taken a leading role at DOGE. More than 1,835 GSA employees have taken a deferred resignation offer since the leadership change, as DOGE continues its push to reportedly “right-size” the federal workforce. Employees who remain have been told to return to the office five days a week. Their credit cards—used for everything from paying for software tools to buying equipment for work—have a spending limit of $1.\n\nEmployees at the all-hands meeting—anxious to hear about whether more people will lose their jobs and why they’ve lost access to critical software tools—were not pleased. \"We are very busy after losing people and this is not [an] efficient use of time,” one employee wrote. “Literally who cares about this,” wrote another.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Commercial quadcopters have been on the mainstream gadget scene for 15 years, proliferating across industries and among hobbyists. There's a swanky DJI store on New York City's Fifth Avenue, and you probably have a neighbor, not to mention a roofer, who owns a drone. So when researchers at the embedded-device security firm Red Balloon started seeing surprising quadcopter accessories on Chinese shopping platforms like Temu and AliExpress, they didn't think much of it at first. As with any popular gadget type, there's a whole ecosystem of niche, wacky, and comical add-ons available for drones. But the more Red Balloon CEO Ang Cui thought about it, the more unsettled he and his colleagues became about how cheap and easy it would be for anyone to buy seemingly disparate add-ons that could easily turn a mainstream quadcopter into a war machine.\n\nThe accessories the researchers found include AI drone guidance modules—essentially small mounted cameras that use object recognition to identify humans and road vehicles at long range—and miles-long fiber optic tethers. Like plugging an ethernet cable directly into your laptop, miles-long tethers allow drones to fly around a large area without being vulnerable to disruption by signal jammers. The researchers recognized them from battlefield footage and other reports that such tethers—not to mention AI guidance modules—are being used by both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war to drop explosives or autopilot crash entire drones themselves into tracked objects without requiring operator control.\n\nThe fact that battlefield technology is widely available in the United States and around the world at low cost augurs a climate in which any actor—from criminal syndicates to paramilitary groups, from disgruntled employees to ostracized teens—can quickly and cheaply gather the needed equipment to remotely go on a destructive and violent rampage.\n\n“The more we looked at this and started to see the big picture, the more my heart sank, because these are toys that are really amazing at killing people,” Cui tells WIRED. “This tech didn't exist in the commercial space two years ago, it wasn't in demand from hobbyists, but now manufacturers are making it for war and it's spilling over.”\n\nThe Red Balloon researchers found that long-range quadcopters are readily available on marketplaces like AliExpress for under $300, with many priced at around $200 each. And the unit price of a long-range drone can drop even lower when purchased in bulk. The researchers noticed sellers who were claiming that they ship 60,000 of the long-range drones per month. They purchased a 1-mile-long tether from a seller on AliExpress for about $260 and another that is 7.5 miles long for about $700. Meanwhile, the researchers also purchased an AI guidance module from a different AliExpress seller for $325. Cui and his colleagues also purchased cargo holders that strap to drones and can be used to transport beer cans or water bottles, but could also be loaded with mortar bombs. These were $106 each. In the two months since the researchers made the purchases, they say the prices of most of the products they bought have even dropped slightly.\n\n“This equipment is mainstream, but it does not just cost a few dollars to make, so I think this stuff is being sold either at or below cost,” Cui says.",

        "title": "How to Avoid US-Based Digital Services—and Why You Might Want To",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Law enforcement requests for user data from Apple, Google, and Meta mean that these companies can decide whether government authorities have access to your personal information, including location data. This means the companies with the most insight into our lives, movements, and communications are frontline arbiters of our constitutional rights and the rights of non-US citizens—a fact some are likely feeling more acutely now than ever.\n\nCollaboration between Big Tech and the Trump administration began before Donald Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Uber each gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Separately, in personal donations, so did Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook.\n\nAmericans concerned about the Trump administration and Silicon Valley’s embrace of it, may consider becoming a “digital expat”—moving your digital life off of US-based systems. Meanwhile, Europeans are starting to see US data services as “no longer safe” for businesses, governments, and societies.\n\nHere’s a brief rundown of the privacy, security, and civil liberties issues related to the use of US-based digital services that suddenly feel more urgent—and what to do about it.\n\nCozying Up\n\nIn anticipation of Trump’s inauguration, Meta-owned Facebook, Instagram, and Threads made drastic policy changes citing alignment with Trump administration values, to permit hate speech and abuse “on topics like immigration and gender.” Meta also signaled its allegiance by ditching its fact-checkers—a frequent target of MAGA world ire. Two days after the inauguration, Meta quietly rolled out pro-life moderation actions through post suppression and account suspensions. Zuckerberg explained the company’s new direction to staff, saying: “We now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government.”\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to our request for comment regarding its partnership, data sharing, or policy changes.\n\nGoogle followed suit. The company changed its Maps and Search results to rename part of the world—the Gulf of Mexico—following a Trump executive order renaming it the Gulf of America, despite the the US claiming control of less than 50 percent of the Gulf. Apple and Microsoft also followed Trump’s order.\n\nGoogle’s consumer products also received a swath of updates in line with the new administration, including further changes to Maps, Calendar, and Search. Next, Google removed the new administration’s “banned” terms from its Google Health product. Then it did an about-face on its public promise not to build weaponized AI tools, such as Project Dragonfly, which was discovered in 2018 to be tailoring Google’s entire platform to enable China’s aggressive crackdown on its citizens. When reached for comment, Google did not immediately respond.\n\nBig Tech aligning with the Trump administration matters because its business models rely on surveillance and amassing our personal data. Meta, Google, Apple and other large tech firms are among the gatekeepers standing between privacy and government requests for user data. Even when tech firms must comply by law, they’re often still free to decide how much information they collect about people and how long they store the data.\n\nGovernment Hand-Outs\n\nCurrent US laws around tech, privacy, and government requests have been guided by bulwarks like the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, US court rulings, and tech companies’ willingness to question the federal government’s opinion that it is entitled to access our personal information and location data. Apple, Google, and Meta each have language about law enforcement data requests that make it seem like they have our backs when it comes to overreach. Now, with companies shaping certain policies, tools, and practices in pursuit of “partnership” with the Trump administration, these companies’ powers over our data takes on new focus.\n\nGenerally, law enforcement can compel US companies to hand over user data using a subpoena, court order, search warrant—or, in rarer cases, a National Security Letter (NSL). As Google explains, an NSL is “one of the authorities granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” Google adds, “FISA orders and authorizations can be used to compel electronic surveillance and the disclosure of stored data, including content from services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos.” How companies respond to these demands can vary in consequential ways.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "An invitation to a “candlelight” dinner held this past Saturday at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club asked prospective guests to spend $1 million per seat. Trump attended the dinner along with Elon Musk, according to multiple photographs and videos of the event viewed by WIRED.\n\nElon Musk, wearing his standard uniform of a black sport coat over a black T-shirt, was seen shaking hands and waving to other attendees. He was with a woman wearing a floor length gown who appeared to be Shivon Zilis, according to Instagram Reels posted by multiple guests. Zilis, a Neuralink executive who previously sat on the board of OpenAI, is the mother of four of Musk’s 14 known children. (Zilis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nMusk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency has spent the last six weeks ransacking federal agencies, sat next to Trump at the dinner.\n\nWIRED previously reported on another candlelight dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the president’s public schedule with a note reading “the President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.” The March 15 candlelight dinner did not appear on the official schedule.\n\n“You are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest speaker President Donald J. Trump,” states the invitation, obtained by WIRED. “$1,000,000 per person.” The invitation has a “MAGA INC.” header and a note at the bottom of the invitation reads, “Donald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a special guest speaker and is not asking for funds or donations.” MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nWIRED has also reported that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the event or the lack of the event’s inclusion on the president’s official schedule.\n\nGot a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86 and zoeschiffer.87.\n\nExperts WIRED has spoken with about these candlelight dinners have noted concerns about their unusual nature. “I can’t recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,” Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, previously told WIRED. “The concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence. People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.”\n\nThe candlelight dinner occurred over the same weekend as the Palm Event, an annual celebration of motorsports in Palm Beach, Florida. One of the celebration’s weekend events occurred at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday afternoon and featured “street sportscars and cars with a motorsports heritage, one-of-a-kind, concept cars, celebrity-owned and cars with a racing history,” according to the Palm Event website. A number of these cars appeared the night prior at the candlelight dinner, according to Instagram reels that featured guests milling around a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Lamborghini, among other luxury vehicles displayed on the lawn.\n\nThe evening also coincided with a serious escalation in Trump’s crackdown on immigration. On Saturday, while Trump and Musk dined with MAGA donors, a federal judge ordered the White House to stop the deportation of people the Trump administration alleged were Venezuelan gang members. Despite that ruling, two planes carrying the alleged gang members flew from Texas to El Salvador. Senior officials reportedly told Axios that the ruling held no force “because the flights were over international waters.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "But most demonstrations of BCIs have been of one-off capabilities—playing a video game, moving a robotic arm, or piloting a drone, for instance. Synchron is aiming to build a BCI system able to seamlessly perform a wide range of tasks in the home environment. “It’s running in real time, in a real environment 24/7, making predictions where context really matters,” Tom Oxley, Synchron’s CEO, told WIRED in an exclusive interview.\n\nTo do that, Synchron’s BCI will need to be trained on a lot of brain data. As part of its collaboration with Nvidia, the two companies are developing what Oxley has dubbed “cognitive AI,” the combination of large amounts of brain data with advanced computing to create more intuitive BCI systems. Oxley sees cognitive AI as the next phase of AI development following agentic AI, which can act and make decisions independently, and physical AI, the integration of AI with robots and other physical systems.\n\n“What we saw Rodney do is a start, but there are so many more interactions that you can actually begin bringing here,” says David Niewolny, senior director of health care and medtech at Nvidia. With cognitive AI, he says, the mind will be the “ultimate user interface.”\n\nCurrently, BCIs are trained with data from a single person. An individual with a BCI is asked to perform a specific task, such as thinking about moving a cursor left or right. An electrode array collects neural activity from the brain while the person is doing that task and researchers “label” that brain data. In other words, they indicate what the subject was doing at each time point that the brain signal was being measured. That labeled data is used to build an AI model that learns to relate that specific pattern of brain activity to a movement intention.\n\nTo achieve its vision of cognitive AI, Synchron plans to use brain data from its current and future trial participants to build an AI model. Maryam Shanechi, a BCI researcher at the University of Southern California and founding director of its Center for Neurotechnology, says a brain foundation model could improve the accuracy of Synchron’s BCI and allow it to perform a more diverse set of functions without having to collect hours of training data from individual patients.\n\n“This model would be more generalizable, more accurate, and then you can fine-tune it in each subject,” she says. “Because this AI has been trained on the brains of many people, it has essentially learned how to learn, how to think, and then you have this brainlike AI system that you can use for a variety of tasks.”\n\nSome training will still be needed for each new BCI user. Users learn how to operate a BCI with prompts such as “squeeze your fist” or “press down like a brake pedal.” A paralyzed person may not be able to make that motion, but the neurons in their brain’s motor cortex still fire up when they attempt to do so. Those intended movement signals are what BCIs decode. Oxley says Synchron will use Cosmos, Nvidia’s new family of AI models, to generate photorealistic simulations of the user’s body, allowing them to watch an avatar of their own movement and mentally rehearse it.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On a Friday afternoon in mid-March, a bunch of (presumably) non-hackers showed up to participate in a new kind of “hackathon.” It was Pi Day, so pie was served, but the mood wasn’t celebratory. Students, researchers, and members of the wider public health community were there, in a lecture hall at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and on Zoom, to rescue data. Whatever they could. According to the flier for the Preserving Public Health Data Hackathon, the current Trump administration was trying to undermine research on everything from climate change to systemic racism, and saving data from government websites meant it would be archived and republished in the event federal agencies tried to remove it. The antiauthoritarian theme came up often: don’t obey in advance.\n\nEveryone in the room and on the Zoom got a crash course in identifying at-risk information, collecting it, and storing it once they did. Backing up certain pieces seemed critical.\n\nFor those who work in public health, protecting research pertaining to gender identity and diversity issues has been a focus since the inauguration. Last year, then-candidate Trump repeated a lot of anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and in the first weeks of his presidency signed executive orders essentially barring transgender people from serving in the military, proclaiming that the US government would only recognize “two genders, male and female,” threatening to withhold federal funds in what is an attempt to bar trans women from sports, and attempting to block gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. Since Trump’s inauguration, hundreds of words—from “transgender” to “Latinx” to “accessible”—have been removed from federal agencies’ websites. In early February, thousands of websites went missing as agencies raced to comply with the executive orders.\n\nIn recent weeks, the targeting of gender-related material has become even starker, after Trump told a joint session of Congress that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had uncovered that the federal government had spent $8 million on “making mice transgender” (it hasn’t), and the Department of Defense performed a purge of “DEI” materials that included flagging, but ultimately not removing, images of the Enola Gay.\n\nOne particular dataset, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (commonly shortened to YRBS), seems particularly at-risk, notes Ariel Beccia, an epidemiologist at the Chan School’s LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence. The YRBS, which tracks scores of health-related issues in young people, is one of the only nationally representative surveys that regularly collects data on transgender kids. Beccia and other public health researchers fear the information in the YRBS may not be available forever.\n\nAnd even if the YRBS can be backed up, the integrity of its data can’t be completely protected from the influence of the new administration. President Trump’s recent moves have also left some in public service afraid to participate in new research, like this year’s survey. “Because of this ‘comply in advance’ strategy, school boards are hesitant to participate in the YRBS,” Beccia told attendees at the hackathon.",

        "content": "Billy Basso was glued to his computer. It was launch day for the Chicago developer’s debut solo game, a surreal Metroidvania called Animal Well, and he couldn’t stop reading reviews online and watching people play the game. He’d pulled off the impossible: breaking through a turbulent industry to create a hit game that would grow to be a critical and commercial success. He just didn’t realize how big of one it would be quite yet.\n\nMost successful video games are made by teams of people that vary in size from a half dozen to somewhere in the hundreds. Basso had made Animal Well entirely on his own, start to finish. Music, art, story—it was all his, dictated by the singular goal to finish the game.\n\nHe thought it would take six months. It took seven years. “My entire life has completely changed since the game has come out,” Basso, 36, says.\n\nThis year, Animal Well is up for five awards at the Game Developers Choice Awards, including prizes for Best Design, Best Audio, and Best Debut. The awards are being handed out this week at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Basso is also a featured speaker. At a talk on Monday detailing the nitty gritty of how he made the game, from coding to describing the game’s lighting, Basso held court in front of a rapt audience packed to the brim. Attendees laughed and “ooh’d” his presentation. While describing some of his more homebrew methods of development, one developer in the audience whispered “this guy is the GOAT.” After his talk, a circle of fans surrounded Basso to offer praise and ask questions.\n\nBasso had arrived. It just took some time to get there.\n\nBasso meets with his fellow developers after his talk on Monday afternoon. Photograph: Darrell Jackson\n\nBasso wasn’t a new developer when he started Animal Well. He’d worked at large companies before, including a stint at NetherRealm working on mobile versions of Mortal Kombat. He was working at a medical startup that created mobile games for doctors—”as weird and niche as you might expect”—and tinkered with his own projects at night. He’d spent a decade of his career with “the desire to make something that I would actually be a fan of.”",

        "title": "Dell UltraSharp 32 4K Thunderbolt Hub Monitor Review: Best IPS Panel",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Can you imagine a Dell product without the iconic DELL logo blaring back at your face? Well, change is afoot as the PC company continues its journey to make the perfect office monitor. The UltraSharp 32 4K Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3225Q) is another excellent entry in Dell’s elite computer monitor line, and I’ll happily celebrate the subtler branding.\n\nBut is this the best monitor you can buy? Well, it doesn't employ OLED, which is a hot trend right now. But with its “enhanced” IPS (in-plane switching) Black panel, over-the-top connectivity, and classy look, you won’t find a better flagship office monitor.\n\nAn ‘Enhanced’ Dell Monitor\n\nIf you’ve seen a high-end Dell monitor, you’ve seen this one. It’s a 32-inch, 16:9 monitor with a silver back, stand, and base. There are a few things I can appreciate about this one though.\n\nFirst is its relatively thin, black bezels. Most Dell (even UltraSharp) monitors have a strip of plastic as a bottom bezel to house the Dell logo, always staring you in the face. That’s absent here, making for a much cleaner look. It has all the other helpful bits you'd expect, such as a wide range of adjustments, including tilting it to go into a vertical orientation, straightforward cable management built into the stand, and VESA support.\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nBut image quality is what makes it distinct. Dell has been championing “IPS Black” for many years, an LG technology that improves the contrast of IPS panels, a way of competing as an alternative to OLED, which is often more expensive and can cause issues like screen burn-in. For a while, Dell was alone in its IPS Black implementation, but now other companies like BenQ and HP have come along.\n\nThe U3225Q, however, comes with the next-generation IPS Black, which cranks up the contrast even more. How much? Well, from 2,000:1 to 3,000:1. That’s not OLED levels of contrast, but it sure is a massive improvement to the IPS of yesteryear. You won’t be able to hit that contrast ratio at 100 percent brightness, but the U3225Q still manages to get some record-setting contrast for an IPS panel. I didn’t have last year’s U3223QE model on hand to compare side-by-side, but the numbers speak for themselves. This is simply the best IPS panel I’ve ever seen, at least in terms of increasing contrast. The benefit of this is darker, richer looking blacks that don't just look grey. Colors also look a bit more vibrant too.\n\nAs for brightness, the U3225Q manages to crank out up to 417 nits. Anything over 300 nits is considered bright enough for office work, but that extra 150 nits ensures it’ll be bright enough even if your desk gets drowned out by sunlight every afternoon.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Knifings, firebombings, shootings, and murder-for-hire plots—all linked to a splinter group of the 764 crime network called “No Lives Matter.” According to its own manifesto, the group seeks to “purify mankind through endless attacks” and has released at least two “kill guides” tied to violent plots in the US and Europe. Intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED reveal growing concern among analysts, but experts remain unsure how to stop the group’s spread.\n\nOn Monday, X experienced intermittent outages after a botnet flooded the social network with junk traffic in an attempt to take down its system. Elon Musk stated that the distributed denial-of-service attack originated from Ukrainian IP addresses, implying that the country—already under siege by a Russian invasion and frequently mocked by the centibillionaire—may have been responsible. Security experts tell WIRED that this is not how DDoS attacks work.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mass layoffs are hurting US cyberdefense, weakening protections against foreign adversaries. Vital staff cuts have left employees overworked and strained international partnerships, according to interviews with staff at the agency that helps safeguard cities, businesses, and nonprofits from cyberattacks. “A lot of people are scared,” says one employee. “We’re waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.” As WIRED takes you inside the agencies at the center of the uncertainty and chaos of the second Trump administration, we've updated our quick and easy guide to using Signal to help you get the most out of the messaging app’s end-to-end encryption.\n\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThose “green bubbles,” the cross-platform text messages that annoy iPhone owners and keep Android users relegated to a group-chat underclass, aren’t just a cultural disconnect. They’re also a security issue: Text messages sent between Android and iOS devices—unlike blue-bubble iMessage texts or Android-to-Android messages—aren’t end-to-end encrypted, leaving them open to surveillance or interception. Now, that may finally be changing.\n\nThe GSM Association, responsible for many widely used telecom standards, this week announced that its Rich Communication Services (or RCS) protocol will now support end-to-end encryption for cross-platform texting, and Apple revealed that it will now integrate that feature of RCS into its iOS devices. Until now, Apple and Google had both supported RCS’s other features in texts sent between iOS and Android, but not end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the devices sending and receiving messages can decrypt them and not any server or snoop that sees them in transit.\n\nNeither Apple nor the GSMA has said exactly when the new privacy features are launching. Until then, anyone sending cross-platform messages would be wise to stick with apps like WhatsApp or Signal that have long provided end-to-end encryption—and have also helped Android and iPhone users avoid personal disputes over bubble colors.\n\nThe White House has tapped Sean Plankey to run CISA, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for American digital defense. Plankey, long considered the leading contender for the role, served in multiple cybersecurity positions in the first Trump administration and previously held senior roles in US Cyber Command. In that DOD agency focused on cyber offense, he served as a weapons and tactics branch chief and earned a Bronze Star for hacking operations in Afghanistan. CISA, like many federal agencies, has faced hundreds of personnel cuts in recent weeks, and its previous director, Chris Krebs, came under harsh criticism under the previous Trump administration for the agency’s work to counter disinformation and secure elections. Krebs was fired in a Trump tweet near the end of his term after CISA described the 2020 election, whose results Trump baselessly contested, as the “most secure in American history.”\n\nNot even the National Security Agency has been spared from Elon Musk’s scorched-earth campaign to gut the federal government. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had visited the intelligence agency in Fort Meade, meeting with leadership to discuss staff reductions and operational changes, according to current and former US officials who spoke to the Journal.\n\nDespite being one of the most insulated branches of US intelligence, the NSA has still found itself pulled into Musk’s orbit. The visit to Fort Meade is another sign of the sweeping nature of his influence and the extraordinary access the world’s richest man has been granted over even the most secretive federal operations.",

Divine G (Domingo) is an inmate at New York’s infamous Sing Sing prison, serving time for a crime he did not commit. During his imprisonment, he finds purpose and joy in the prison’s theater group, part of its (very real) Rehabilitation Through the Arts program. By tapping into his inner thespian, Divine G is able to connect with his emotions, and he becomes determined to prove his innocence. But his undeniable acting talent, which inspires some of his fellow inmates, ends up posing a problem when it comes time for a parole hearing. Ultimately, Divine comes to respect the transformative power of the arts in helping him and some of his fellow inmates to overcome their past traumas. Making the film even more powerful is the fact that many of the actors are formerly incarcerated men who took part in the program.\n\nHeretic\n\nHugh Grant earned some much-deserved awards consideration for playing so far against type in this religion-themed psychological thriller. Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) are two young Mormon missionaries who are desperate to find someone—anyone—who will let them speak about their religion in an attempt to convert new members to the church. When Mr. Reed (Grant), a seemingly kind older man, invites them into his home in order to deliver their spiel to him and his wife, it quickly becomes apparent, at least to Sister Barnes, that something is amiss. And that Reed doesn’t so much want to hear about religion as he does talk about it—and force his own beliefs on the young women in increasingly bizarre, and deadly, ways.\n\nBeau is Afraid\n\nLike writer/director Ari Aster’s previous two films, Hereditary and Midsommar, a written summary never quite seems to do justice to his very specific brand of moviemaking. In Beau Is Afraid, which is undoubtedly the most surreal of all his films, Joaquin Phoenix stars in the title role of Beau, a middle-aged man who lives alone in a crime-ridden neighborhood where even running across the street to the store can be a deadly adventure. When Beau, after a bizarre series of events, learns that his mother has died, he must find a way to forge ahead in the face of his many anxieties in order to travel home and deal with the aftermath. If only he didn’t keep falling prey to people promising to help him, only to draw him into their own surreal circumstances. Though at times it can feel a little self-indulgent—and, at two hours and 59 minutes, overly long—Phoenix’s performance and Aster’s auteurist stamp make it nonetheless compelling.\n\nCarrie\n\nEven if you’ve seen it 100 times and know what’s coming next, Carrie still has the ability to make you jump out of your chair—nearly 50 years after its original release. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy, awkward teen who has been criminally sheltered (and regularly abused) by her God-fearing mother (Piper Laurie). But when the neighborhood kids nicknamed her “Creepy Carrie,” they were on to something. Because when Carrie is stressed, pissed, or otherwise facing some kind of psychological torment, she lashes out—with her kinetic powers. Unfortunately, her classmates only learn about this latent talent when it’s too late: after they’ve properly humiliated her at her high school prom. Though there are sequels and remakes, there’s only one original (and solid) adaptation of Stephen King’s debut novel, and it’s this one.\n\nWe Live in Time\n\nAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh ignite the screen with their chemistry in this romantic tearjerker that follows the couple over the course of a decade, from their meet-not-so-cute (she hits him with her car) to their journey into parenthood and, eventually, facing the ultimate curveball that threatens their happily-ever-after. Garfield and Pugh are two of the most acclaimed actors of their generation, and We Live in Time proves why.\n\nBlue Velvet\n\nMulholland Drive may be widely considered David Lynch’s masterpiece, but Blue Velvet isn’t too far behind. Like most of Lynch’s projects, a general summary doesn’t really help sell the film: Clean-cut college student Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home to help out at the family hardware store after his father has a stroke … and randomly finds a severed ear on the ground. While the detective assigned to investigate the incident tells Jeffrey not to discuss the crime, the detective’s teenage daughter (Laura Dern) seems to know as much about the crime as her dad does and teams up with Jeffrey to learn more. Their suspicions eventually lead them to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a sultry nightclub singer, who seems to have some weird kinks (as Jeffrey sees for himself while hiding in her apartment). As always, Lynch’s movies are better experienced than explained. And Blue Velvet, which earned Lynch a Best Director Oscar nomination, is one of the late auteur’s very best.\n\nSons of Ecstasy\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, may seem like an odd setting for a bitter feud between wannabe kingpins, but that’s exactly where this documentary takes place. It was there, in the 1990s, that two young men—Liverpool-born stockbroker Shaun Attwood and New York mafia royalty Gerard Gravano—found themselves at violent odds as both attempted to become the preferred supplier of ecstasy to local nightclubs and desert raves. For Gravano, son of Sammy “The Bull” Gravano, there’s a legacy to uphold. For Attwood, getting burned out by his day job led to the desire to become something more. Both men sat down with directors Elli Hakami and Julian P. Hobbs to tell their own stories.\n\nJuror #2\n\nUp until now, most of what you’ve heard about Juror #2 is how it’s one of Clint Eastwood’s most accomplished directorial efforts—and yet somehow it got shafted when it came to its theatrical release. Now’s your chance to see what all the fuss is about. Justin Kemp (Nicholas Hoult) is a journalist and recovering alcoholic who is making every effort to maintain his sobriety. That becomes a bit of a challenge when he’s put on the jury of a high-profile murder trial … only to realize that he may have inadvertently played a part in what happened. Hoult is fantastic in this edge-of-your-seat legal (and ethical) drama.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nIt has been nearly 40 years since Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice stormed the late ’80s box office. In the decades since, we’ve often heard rumblings that a sequel was in the works. Or might be in the works. Or most definitely was in the works. Or might not be in the cards at all. Well, in 2024 it finally happened, and it was as if Michael Keaton had never stepped away from the role at all (eternal life has a way of doing that to you). This time, however, Lydia (Winona Ryder) is still doing her best to forget her rendezvous with the bio-exorcism pro. But when she returns to her childhood home, it’s her own badass daughter (Jenna Ortega) who finds a way to bring him back into all their lives.\n\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story\n\nJames Gunn’s new version of Superman won’t arrive in theaters until July. In the meantime, audiences have Gunn and his DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran (partly) to thank for bringing this long-overdue documentary about the ultimate superhero actor to worldwide audiences. Directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui deliver a heartfelt, moving tribute to Reeve—as an actor, yes, but even more so as a person who never gave up. Alexandra Reeve Givens, Matthew Reeve, and Will Reeve—Reeve’s children—share their own stories about their dad, giving the project yet another layer of intimacy. No, you’re crying.\n\nJoker: Folie À Deux\n\nFive years ago, Joker was a major awards season contender: The film, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, earned a total of 11 Oscar nominations—and went home with two of them (including one for Phoenix). Joker: Folie À Deux did not follow the same path. The sequel, in which Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck finds love with the equally disturbed Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), fizzled at the box office and was met with pretty scathing reviews. Still: Judge the film for yourself, we say. Even if you agree with the bulk of critics, spending 138 minutes with Phoenix and Gaga playing off of each other at their most unhinged is worth the price of admission (which, in this case, is the Max subscription you already have).\n\nWatchmen: Chapter I\n\nBrandon Vietti (Batman: Under the Red Hood) directs this innovative animated adaption of Alan Moore’s Hugo Award-winning graphic novel about an investigation into the murder of Edward Blake—better known as a superhero named the Comedian. When the police come up empty in terms of suspects, the costumed vigilante Rorschach (Titus Welliver) decides to take the case into his own hands, and eventually comes to believe that someone is attempting to knock off superheroes. So he enlists the help of a group of them in order to put a stop to the killing spree.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nMaXXXine is the third film in writer-director Ti West’s X trilogy, which began with X and Pearl. It’s set immediately after the events of Pearl: Mia Goth’s Maxine Minx is desperate to escape her upbringing as a preacher’s daughter and make the move from porn to more mainstream movies. She gets her chance when she lands the lead in a horror movie, The Puritan II. Then her friends start getting murdered. Ultimately, Maxine is forced to confront the sins of her past and find a way to achieve the fame she so desperately dreams of.\n\nCivil War\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, the United States has transformed into an all-out battlefield between an authoritarian government, headed by a third-term president (Nick Offerman), and a stream of secessionist movements that threaten to destroy the country as we know it. But a group of journalists (led by Kirsten Dunst) is determined to document the downfall of America at any cost, so they set about heading to the White House in order to interview the embattled president. Which is much easier said than done. Oscar nominee Alex Garland (Ex-Machina) writes and directs this dystopian drama that often hits uncomfortably close to home.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nFuriosa may been dubbed last summer’s first box office “bomb,” but don’t let those dollar-focused headlines deter you from this one. Anya Taylor-Joy, who is undoubtedly one of the most versatile actors working today, shines in the role of Imperator Furiosa, a badass emancipator who dares to challenge gender conventions in a dangerous, postapocalyptic world where (no surprise at all) men make the rules. Taylor-Joy does an admirable job embracing the role that Charlize Theron memorably originated in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nDrive My Car\n\nDespite earning four Oscar nominations in 2022—and winning one for Best International Feature Film—it still feels entirely accurate to state that Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car remains woefully underseen. Here’s your chance to do your part to fix that. Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) ia a renowned theater director still reeling from the death of his wife. Eventually, he makes the decision to begin working again and agrees to a two-month residency to direct a play in Hiroshima, an hour from his home. So each day, a young woman (Toko Miura) drives him to and from the theater. All that time spent in a confined space together eventually leads to a friendship—one where Kafuku feels comfortable sharing the challenges he is facing with his new project and, eventually, the truth about the way in which his wife betrayed him. Road movies have never felt so intimate—or leisurely.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding\n\nEnglish writer-director Rose Glass follows up her BAFTA-nominated Saint Maud with this twisty, hyper-violent love story. It’s 1989 in a rural New Mexico town where gym manager Lou (Kristen Stewart) is doing her best to stay under the radar and keep an eye on her sister Beth (Jena Malone), who is in an abusive relationship with her husband JJ (Dave Franco). But Lou’s life is turned upside down when Jackie (Katy O'Brian), a gorgeous young bodybuilder, begins coming to Lou’s gym to train for an upcoming competition in Las Vegas. The two fall in love—and then Lou’s hidden family secrets come tumbling out of the closet and threaten her life, and the lives of those she cares about.\n\nFaye\n\n“I’m Faye Dunaway. That’s who I am.” That’s the way the Oscar winner introduces herself in the trailer for Laurent Bouzereau’s feature-length documentary. But what the film reveals is that there’s a lot more to Faye Dunaway than the glamorous image associated with the legendary star of Network. Dunaway opens up in a way that has rarely been seen before, discussing her childhood and family, her struggles with bipolar disorder, and how the characters she has played continue to impact her. It’s a fascinating portrait of a true Hollywood icon.\n\nQuad Gods\n\nJess Jacklin’s feature documentary follows the fascinating journey of Blake, Prentice, and Richard—three individuals with quadriplegia who meet in a neuro-rehabilitation lab at Mount Sinai Hospital and launch a plan to create the world’s first all-quadriplegic esports team. It’s a noble pursuit, but one fraught with challenges as they break down the doors of ableism. At its heart, Quad Gods is a story of friendship, perseverance, and survival.\n\nAm I OK?\n\nLucy (Dakota Johnson) is a thirtysomething living in Los Angeles, constantly failing at relationships and wondering why she doesn’t have everything figured out yet. After drunkenly sharing the story of the time she kissed a female friend as a teen, she begins to realize that the problem in her love life might not be the men she’s choosing, but that she’s choosing men at all. Former Saturday Night Live writer Lauren Pomerantz penned the script for the film based on her own experience of coming out in her thirties. Tig Notaro and her wife Stephanie Allynne do an admirable job as codirectors, treating Lucy’s journey of self-discovery with the respect it deserves—and plenty of humor.\n\nMoviePass, MovieCrash\n\nFor better or worse, millions of film fans will remember 2012 as the year of MoviePass. For $25 per month, you could basically live in a movie theater—which was great for audiences, not so great for movie theaters (which were already struggling), and eventually disastrous for the company itself. For anyone who still has their MoviePass, this revealing documentary tells the real story of all that went wrong behind the scenes, and shares the story of the unsung heroes who really did just want to create a product that movie lovers could embrace. By the way: If you do indeed still have your original MoviePass, this doc has made it a worthwhile piece of memorabilia—with some selling for north of $1,000.\n\nDune & Dune: Part Two\n\nSince breaking through with the Oscar-nominated Incendies (2010), Denis Villeneuve has continued to prove that he’s one of the most talented filmmakers working today. As if making a Blade Runner sequel that didn’t suck wasn’t enough, Villeneuve then went on to crack the cinematic code on Frank Herbert’s Dune series—something that true visionaries like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky had attempted before him, albeit largely unsuccessfully. Both the 2021 original film and its sequel are streaming on Max—as is Lynch’s 1984 adaptation (which has become a bit of a cult classic over the years). The film follows the fate of the planet Arrakis—and its supply of melange, a unique spice and the most valuable substance in the universe—which rests in the hands of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the untested son of a powerful duke. Looking for more Dune action? The prequel series Dune: Prophecy, starring Emily Watson, Olivia Williams, and Mark Strong is streaming in full.\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\n\nIf you’re a fan of the absurdly dark work of Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness) or are just discovering the uncomfortable brilliance of Barry Keoghan, The Killing of a Sacred Deer has got your name written all over it. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a highly esteemed surgeon with a loving wife (Nicole Kidman) and children whose life is turned upside down after he befriends Martin (Keoghan), an awkward teen who Steven learns lost his father a few years earlier. What begins as a seeming act of kindness on Steven’s part soon turns into a truly demented version of Sophie’s Choice. As always, Lanthimos’ ability to mix humor with pathos remains unmatched—perhaps never more so than here.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nIn 1943, Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) was the commandant of Auschwitz who spent his days playing god with the lives of the concentration camp’s innocent prisoners. But what happened when Höss went home? That’s the reality Jonathan Glazer’s Oscar-winning film examines, and the answer is: Not much. Höss lives right next door to the camp, in the so-called Zone of Interest, with his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and their five children. Within those four walls, they strive to build a dream life for their family—while the sound of gunshots, incoming trains, and furnaces being lit are just a part of daily life. Yes, it’s every bit as brutal—and necessary—as it sounds.\n\nBlack Swan\n\nNatalie Portman gives what might very well end up being the defining performance of her career in this dark dance drama from Darren Aronofsky. Nina Sayers (Portman) is a dancer with the New York City Ballet whose entire life has been dedicated to her art, in large part due to her overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey), who was also a ballerina and pushes her daughter to have the career she wanted for herself. Nina’s life is turned upside down when she lands the lead in a new production of Swan Lake, only to realize that she’ll be splitting the part with the free-spirited Lily (Mila Kunis) who quickly becomes both the only friend Nina has ever really had and her most bitter rival. Soon, she descends into a dizzying madness that is reflected in Aronofsky’s directorial choices, which make the audience feel every bit of her emotions.\n\nWonka\n\nTimothée Chalamet stars as Willy Wonka in this perfectly entertaining origin story of Roald Dahl’s quirky chocolatier, directed by Paddington’s Paul King. While it doesn’t hit the same as Mel Stuart’s Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory—really, who could match Gene Wilder’s somersaulting candy maker?—it also far surpasses Tim Burton’s fairly needless 2005 remake.\n\nDream Scenario\n\nLike Forrest Gump’s famed box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get from a Nicolas Cage performance. But he’s a one-of-a-kind actor whose roles tend to fall into one of two categories: totally transcendent, or scenery-chewing at its most voracious. Dream Scenario is very much the former, and has been heralded as one of the Oscar-winning actor’s best performances by some critics. Rightfully so. Cage stars as Paul Matthews, an unassuming biology professor who suddenly begins appearing in strangers’ dreams and achieves viral fame as a result of it. Like any good Cage performance, this one is multifaceted and examines the downside of sudden fame and what it really costs.\n\nDicks: The Musical\n\nA24—the studio known for its edgy, award-winning indies like Moonlight and Ex Machina—takes a dive into the musical genre with this adaptation of the off-Broadway hit Fucking Identical Twins (and you thought Dicks: The Musical was a raunchy title). Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp cowrote and costar in this over-the-top musical as two coworkers who discover that they’re long-lost twin brothers, and they attempt to Parent Trap their parents (played by Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally). Megan Thee Stallion plays their boss. Anyone offended by an f-bomb—or dozens of them—might want to give this one a skip.\n\nBarbie\n\nGreta Gerwig is a master of breathing new life into old properties (see: Little Women). With Barbie, she has ignited a revolution. Barbie (Margot Robbie) is living her best life in Barbieland—until one day, when her perfectly plastic world, and heels, suddenly begin to collapse. To get her fabulous life back, Barbie must travel to the real world—well, Los Angeles—to determine who or what is causing her existential crisis. The film grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, meaning you've already seen it. But even if you did, it’s absolutely worth a second watch—if only to lament its many Oscar snubs.\n\nRoboCop\n\nFrom Total Recall to Showgirls and back to Basic Instinct, director Paul Verhoeven has a track record almost unmatched in modern cinema. RoboCop, his dystopian take on law enforcement, is proof. Set in a bleak vision of Detroit overrun with crime, it follows a cop (Peter Weller) who gets fatally wounded and turned into, yes, a robot cop, who you might think is good at fighting crime, but of course is not. Some of the visual effects may look a little beat up now, but in 1987, they looked like the future. Also, if RoboCop leaves you wanting more, the film’s two sequels and 2014 reboot—none of which, sadly, were directed by Verhoeven—are also available on Max.\n\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life\n\nAlbert Brooks is a comedian’s comedian. Though he might be best known as the filmmaker behind such celebrated comedies as Defending Your Life, Lost in America, Real Life, and Mother, he’s also a brilliant actor (with an Oscar nomination to prove it). Brooks’ longtime pal Rob Reiner directs this charming documentary, which documents Brooks’ one-of-a-kind talent, with a stunning lineup of A-listers—including David Letterman, Steven Spielberg, Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, Chris Rock, Larry David, and Ben Stiller—all ready to sing his praises.\n\nReality\n\nIn 2017, an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election was leaked anonymously. One year later, former NSA translator Reality Winner (yes, that’s her real name) was sentenced to more than five years in prison for the crime—the longest sentence ever received by a government whistleblower. HBO’s reigning muse, Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria, The White Lotus), shines in this gripping true story, which plays out mostly in real time as the FBI knocks on the 25-year-old’s door and spends more than an hour questioning her.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nFinding success in one’s lifetime might seem like the dream of every artist, but Nan Goldin has bigger ambitions. Though she’s a photographer by trade, she’s an activist by calling and has long used her camera to capture painfully intimate moments of America in crisis, including extensive work focused on the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics. But All the Beauty and the Bloodshed reveals the artist in conflict: Should she allow her work to be showcased in one of the prominent museums or galleries that have received endowments from the Sackler family—the Big Pharma family that many blame for America’s opioid crisis? It’s a moving portrait of an artist willing to risk it all for her beliefs.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "That’s what DESI was designed to do: take precise measurements of the apparent size of these bubbles (both near and far) by determining the distances to galaxies and quasars over 11 billion years. That data can then be sliced into chunks to determine how fast the universe was expanding at each point of time in the past, the better to model how dark energy was affecting that expansion.\n\nAn Upward Trend\n\nLast year’s results were based on analysis of a full year’s worth of data taken from seven different slices of cosmic time and include 450,000 quasars, the largest ever collected, with a record-setting precision of the most distant epoch (between 8 to 11 billion years back) of 0.82 percent. While there was basic agreement with the Lamba CDM model, when those first-year results were combined with data from other studies (involving the cosmic microwave background radiation and Type Ia supernovae), some subtle differences cropped up.\n\nEssentially, those differences suggested that the dark energy might be getting weaker. In terms of confidence, the results amounted to a 2.6-sigma level for the DESI’s data combined with CMB datasets. When adding the supernovae data, those numbers grew to 2.5-sigma, 3.5-sigma, or 3.9-sigma levels, depending on which particular supernova dataset was used.\n\nIt's important to combine the DESI data with other independent measurements because “we want consistency,” said DESI co-spokesperson Will Percival of the University of Waterloo. “All of the different experiments should give us the same answer to how much matter there is in the universe at present day, how fast the universe is expanding. It’s no good if all the experiments agree with the Lambda-CDM model, but then give you different parameters. That just doesn't work. Just saying it’s consistent to the Lambda-CDM, that’s not enough in itself. It has to be consistent with Lambda-CDM and give you the same parameters for the basic properties of that model.”\n\nThese latest results cover the first three years of collected data, spanning almost 15 million galaxies and quasars. Once again, the DESI data alone was consistent with Lambda CDM, i.e., the dark energy is constant. And once again, when combined with other datasets—from CMB, supernovae, and weak gravitational lensing studies—strong hints emerged that dark energy might be changing over time. The confidence level ranges from 2.8 to 4.2 sigma, depending on the combination of datasets—just shy of the five-sigma threshold.\n\nThis might strike the average citizen as an incremental advance, but the reality is more complicated. “The DESI data itself is not incremental,” said Percival. “We now have three years of data rather than one year of data. That is substantial, not just because of an increased area but because we’ve increased the overlap. The way we do the survey is we build up plates on the sky, and, after three years rather than one year of operations, we have a lot more of those overlaps filled in. So our data is a lot more complete in the sense that we’ve gone down to the full depth that we expect to get to in more patches. Consequently, our BAO measurements themselves are a lot better. They’re between a factor of two and three better depending on exactly this balance between area versus depth.”",

        "title": "Inside Elon Musk’s ‘Digital Coup’",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "As America’s most decorated civil servants sipped cocktails in the presidential ballroom of the Capital Hilton, worrying about their table assignments and wondering where they fell in the pecking order between US senator and UAE ambassador, Elon Musk sat staring at his phone, laughing.\n\nFew of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nation’s code base—or, better yet, scrap it altogether.\n\nMusk wasn’t big on formalities, but he’d dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new “sprouts” only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest.\n\nThe social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phone—talking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building’s Secretary of War Suite. He’d even had his video-gaming rig installed there.\n\nAs Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal government—people like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname “Big Balls”; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Musk’s acquisition, where he’d once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto “Futuate cohortem urbanam”—Latin for something like “Fuck these city dwellers.”\n\nIn Musk’s mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the government’s byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. They’d help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton: Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms? They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then: What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs?",

        "title": "This Russian Tech Bro Helped Steal $93 Million and Landed in US Prison. Then Putin Called",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers’ arguments and his friends’ appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\n\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\n\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\n\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\n\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there’s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\n\nIllustration: Vartika Sharma\n\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she’s gorgeous in her backless gown; he’s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. “I do not know a more decent person than my husband,” Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\n\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report.\n\nKlyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.”",

        "title": "Inside Google’s Two-Year Frenzy to Catch Up With OpenAI",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "But more piles of fascinating research are only useful to Google if they generate that most important of outputs: profit. Most customers generally aren’t yet willing to pay for AI features directly, so the company may be looking to sell ads in the Gemini app. That’s a classic strategy for Google, of course, one that long ago spread to the rest of Silicon Valley: Give us your data, your time, and your attention, check the box on our terms of service that releases us from liability, and we won’t charge you a dime for this cool tool we built.\n\nFor now, according to data from Sensor Tower, OpenAI’s estimated 600 million all-time global app installs for ChatGPT dwarf Google’s 140 million for the Gemini app. And there are plenty of other chatbots in this AI race too—Claude, Copilot, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity—many of them backed by Google’s biggest and best-funded competitors (or, in the case of Claude, Google itself). The entire industry, not just Google, struggles with the fact that generative AI systems have required billions of dollars in investment, so far unrecouped, and huge amounts of energy, enough to extend the lives of decades-old coal plants and nuclear reactors. Companies insist that efficiencies are adding up every day. They also hope to drive down errors to the point of winning over more users. But no one has truly figured out how to generate a reliable return or spare the climate.\n\nAnd Google faces one challenge that its competitors don’t: In the coming years, up to a quarter of its search ad revenue could be lost to antitrust judgments, according to JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth. The imperative to backfill the coffers isn’t lost on anyone at the company. Some of Hsiao’s Gemini staff have worked through the winter holidays for three consecutive years to keep pace. Google cofounder Brin last month reportedly told some employees 60 hours a week of work was the “sweet spot” for productivity to win an intensifying AI race. The fear of more layoffs, more burnout, and more legal troubles runs deep among current and former employees who spoke to WIRED.\n\nOne Google researcher and a high-ranking colleague say the pervasive feeling is unease. Generative AI clearly is helpful. Even governments that are prone to regulating big tech, such as France’s, are warming up to the technology’s lofty promises. Inside Google DeepMind and during public talks, Hassabis hasn’t relented an inch from his goal of creating artificial general intelligence, a system capable of human-level cognition across a range of tasks. He spends occasional weekends walking around London with his Astra prototype, getting a taste of a future in which the entire physical world, from that Thames duck over there to this Georgian manor over here, is searchable. But AGI will require systems to get better at reasoning, planning, and taking charge.\n\nIn January, OpenAI took a step toward that future by letting the public in on another experiment: its long-awaited Operator service, a so-called agentic AI that can act well beyond the chatbot window. Operator can click and type on websites just as a person would to execute chores like booking a trip or filling out a form. For the moment, it performs these tasks much more slowly and cautiously than a human would, and at a steep cost for its unreliability (available as part of a $200 monthly plan). Google, naturally, is working to bring agentic features to its coming models too. Where the current Gemini can help you develop a meal plan, the next one will place your ingredients in an online shopping cart. Maybe the one after that will give you real-time feedback on your onion-chopping technique.\n\nAs always, moving quickly may mean gaffing often. In late January, before the Super Bowl, Google released an ad in which Gemini was caught in a slipup even more laughably wrong than Bard’s telescope mistake: It estimated that half or more of all the cheese consumed on Earth is gouda. As Gemini grows from a sometimes-credible facts machine to an intimate part of human lives—life coach, all-seeing assistant—Pichai says that Google is proceeding cautiously. Back on top at last, though, he and the other Google executives may never want to get caught from behind again. The race goes on.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.

        "content": "Two months into the second Trump administration, the United States is in pure chaos mode. Tens of thousands of workers are fired one week and forcibly rehired the next. Tariffs rise and fall based not on strategy but on one man’s ire. Deportations fly in the face of judicial orders, careening the country toward a constitutional crisis. The only constant is the volatility itself.\n\nOn paper, that may be surprising. A central premise of Donald Trump’s appeal is that he is an apex businessman. Same with Elon Musk. The elevator pitch: Through the sheer force of their combined savvy, America will be saved from “bankruptcy”—or worse. There aren’t many Harvard Business School case studies, though, that suggest maximum instability is the path to success.\n\nThere’s plenty of Occam’s razor at work here: The US is wobbling wildly because its president and de facto CEO are some combination of self-serving and inept. But in between and among the absurdities, something darker takes shape. Inherent in every chaotic act is a challenge. Every outrage is a test.\n\nIn the meantime, the uncertainty has international consequences. Tourism has plummeted, as potential visitors cancel their trips to a country increasingly, openly hostile to noncitizens. Europe is rearming itself in the face of a heightened potential for conflict, as Ukraine becomes the fulcrum on which decades of solidarity between the US and Europe may pivot. Allies have considered sharing less intelligence with their US counterparts, given the Trump administration’s increasingly cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt’s a heel turn worthy of a WWE Monday Night RAW plotline. But the US is not in the business of selling spectacle. Its value lies in its reliability. Instead it is now erratic, unpredictable. It’s messy. International politics is a relationship business; Donald Trump seems intent on undermining America’s relationships at every turn. (Well, except toward Moscow.)\n\nThere’s the slash-and-burn approach to budgeting, a seeming race to create a minimally viable government. The operative part of a turnaround plan is the “plan” part. Firing as many people as possible as quickly as possible—without apparent consideration for actual skills or value that they bring to the role—does not qualify as a plan. It’s just more instability.\n\nThe good news is that many of those employees are being reinstated, as the gears of the judiciary have slowly begun to turn. But that reinstatement itself may prove temporary, depending on what higher courts say. And even if those workers do come back, how motivated will they be to stay now that they know how their employer views their worth?\n\nMore to the point, who would go work for the US government in its current state? Civil service doesn’t pay great, but at least you get to feel like you’re serving a higher calling with a side order of job security. The only callings being served right now are Donald Trump’s retribution tour and Elon Musk’s amateur hour AI jamboree. Eventually they’ll run out of SpaceX interns to hire.",

        "title": "‘It’s a Heist’: Real Federal Auditors Are Horrified by DOGE",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government upside down. It has moved from agency to agency, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its “findings” on its website, many of which have been revealed to be errors.\n\nBut two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.\n\n“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”\n\nIn September, in a speech during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of $1.7 trillion. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.\n\nWhile there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—a Government Accountability Office study published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.\n\nThe auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”\n\nThere are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made available to the public. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.",

        "title": "Nearly All Cybertrucks Have Been Recalled Because Tesla Used the Wrong Glue",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Tesla said Thursday it would recall nearly all the Cybertrucks it has produced to repair a stainless steel trim panel that the carmaker said could become detached from the vehicle while driving. It’s the eighth recall for the distinctive all-electric pickup, which hit US roads just over two years ago.\n\nUnlike many other Tesla-related recalls, though, this one cannot be fixed with an over-the-air software update; the trucks must be brought into a service center for repairs. The recall affects more than 46,000 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025.\n\nThe recall is related to a cosmetic applique on the vehicle’s exterior, which is attached to the rest of the truck by a kind of glue, according to a filing published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the US’s road safety regulator. On affected Cybertrucks, the adhesive can separate from the rest of the truck, creating a possible “road hazard” for others and increasing the risk of a crash.\n\nComplaints about the trim first bubbled up in social media posts; Tesla reportedly halted Cybertruck production last week. Tesla says in the filing that it began to investigate the issue in early January. The filing says Tesla will repair the issue with another kind of adhesive “not prone to environmental embrittlement.”\n\nDale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at the Royal College of Art London, labels this latest glue recall for the Cybertruck as “surprising.”\n\n“Glues are used a lot more than people think in car body construction these days,” he says. “Rather than having a mechanical fixing, weld or a screw or a bolt, it's very effective gluing panels together for a lighter construction. It's become very popular. Jaguar, Lexus, Audi, they'll use glues at some point. So I'm very surprised. It's not as if it's an unknown science. I've not heard [of problems] anywhere else.”\n\nThere are numerous glues the auto industry uses to bond panels and parts together, Harrow says, adding that different adhesives are used depending on strength of bond needed, particular circumstances, and materials involved. However, what is different with the Cybertruck compared to other vehicles is its highly unconventional use of stainless steel for its panels.\n\n“Stainless steel is the big difference,\" Harrow says. \"So maybe there's been an issue there?\" Harrow points out that this fault appears to be happening in cold weather, and that it might be that the stainless steel is conducting cold better, possibly just enough to make a difference in the curing process.\n\n“I could surmise that something on the production line is not quite bonding at the right temperature or getting the right UV coverage? And that could be due to the stainless steel having a different density from standard steel. It's not a small company, and it's not doing things on the cheap. So I'll be very surprised if there wasn't the knowledge within the company to fix this. But it would need quite a bit of investigation, I think, to find out the real cause of it.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years’ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\n\nOn the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\n\nOne now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.\n\nAnother removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”\n\nThe Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general-purpose government chatbot.\n\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.\n\nRemoving blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.\n\nSince President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s long-standing allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, The New York Times reported in December.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. “If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.\n\nSources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.\n\n“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies’ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”",

        "title": "The Severance Twist I Can’t Forgive",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers through the finale of Severance Season 2.\n\nThe world of Severance is so unfailingly cold, so sterile, that the seventh episode of Season 2, “Chikhai Bardo,” came as a palpable shock. Flashback scenes detailing the love story and marriage of Gemma (Dichen Lachman) and Mark (Adam Scott) were stylistically totally different; they featured dappled natural light and ambient noise, and were shot on film—a production choice that gave both characters a grainy, imperfect aura. Directed by the cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné, the episode explained what happened to Gemma after her supposed death in a car crash—her severance into multiple consciousnesses, each one set up to endure a different kind of torment, and her captivity on a hidden floor of Lumon that she never gets to leave. But it also drew a sharp distinction between the corporation’s frigid absurdity, with its history of ether-huffing children and creepy animatronic hall of founders, and the naturalistic humanity of the world beyond it. “Who are you?” Mark asks Gemma when they first meet, donating blood via ominously Lumon-branded equipment. This is, I should note, exactly the same question he asks Helly R. (Britt Lower) in the opening seconds of the series. Unlike Helly, though, Gemma has no trouble responding.\n\nSeason 2 made Gemma fully human, after first introducing her as Lumon’s robotic, apparently lobotomized “wellness counselor,” Ms. Casey. Unsevered, the show revealed, Gemma was funny, sharp, fully in love with Mark, and devastated by her inability to have a child with him. Lumon has always been sinister in a buffoonish way, but its treatment of Gemma in “Chikhai Bardo” was horrifically evil: preying on her pain at a reproductive clinic, faking her death, confining her to windowless quarters, lying to her about Mark’s new life, and experimenting on her like a lab rat, making her suffer through staged dentist appointments and airplane disasters over and over and over again. All of this is in service of a mission that, after the Season 2 finale, “Cold Harbor,” remains blurry but seems to entail sacrificing Gemma in a goat-attended ritual in order to revive the consciousness of Lumon’s founder, Kier Eagan. (And, yes, I feel high even typing these words.)\n\nRead: Severance cannot save you\n\nSeason 1 of Severance spent enough time outside of Lumon to fully underscore how weird the company was, with its cultlike devotion to Kier, its obsession with round foods (eggs, melons, waffles), its bizarrely hostile leadership. The people who fleshed out the show’s world beyond the company—a Lumon-protesting punk band; Mark’s sister, Devon (Jen Tullock); and even depressed Mark himself—were mostly recognizably normal. Its inner acolytes came across, by contrast, as uncannily contrived kooks. Season 2, though, has confined itself more closely to the Lumon realm, which made “Chikhai Bardo” and its depiction of pre-severed Mark and Gemma stand out. And, to me, the season’s cramped, airless Lumon setting also made the finale’s closing scenes crueler, as outie Mark rescued Gemma from the company’s netherworld, only for innie Mark to abandon her on the other side of the door, screaming, while he ran back toward Helly.\n\nAt a theoretical level, the final twist makes sense. Innies and outies, Severance has emphasized throughout Season 2, are essentially different people with distinct personalities, needs, desires, and moral compasses. Innie Mark, emotionally innocent and as impulsive as an adolescent, might indeed choose Helly, even if the two are now trapped together with no conceivable way out. The ending sets up a third season of Severance that remains relatively stable, with the Lumon CEO Jame Eagan likely still intent on completing Kier’s “grand addendum,” even if it means ignoring yet another messy employee uprising. And Lower’s double-edged work this season toggling between her innie, the lovely, irreverent Helly, and her outie, the icy, manipulative Helena, has been astonishing, more than justifying the ending by emphasizing the show’s philosophical questions about nature versus nurture and whether love can transcend severance. So why is what happened to Gemma still so hard to swallow?\n\nMaybe because, on the show, Gemma has only ever experienced suffering: before Lumon, during Lumon, and now after. Even in her escape, she’s losing something yet again. (Lachman’s bewildered, “Mark S? What’s taking place?” as she found herself kissing him in the elevator, having switched into the severed mode of Ms. Casey, was pitch-perfect.) Otherwise, “Cold Harbor” did everything it needed to plot-wise, while throwing a spectacularly nervy marching-band set piece and a teeth-grindingly stressful escape sequence into the mix. There were revelations. (Mark has indeed been coding different souls for Gemma this whole time, as part of a momentous project to possibly bring back Kier—which does, though, urge the question of whom the other innies have been refining.) There were suggestions. (Is Kier Eagan actually alive in digital form, imprisoned in the animatronic form of himself?) There were hugely gratifying insurrections—Dylan and the marching band against Seth Milchick, the manager of the severed floor; Milchick against a roboticized Kier; the mysterious goat lady against the Lumon manager Mr. Drummond. (Emil thanks you.)\n\nRead: What are the puzzles of Severance about?\n\nThere were also eggs. So many eggs! (Presumably, with the show’s rumored $20 million an episode budget, the show can afford them.) We spent so much time this season pondering the meaning of the goats when the eggs were there all along: raw eggs, egg bars, eggs cut neatly into six different segments, served on the most menacing plate a prop master ever thrifted. From its opening scenes, Severance has presented the procedure the show is named for as a kind of birth, the spawning of a new, immature being. With “Cold Harbor,” we finally got a sense of the full life cycle. The childlike innies have become more akin to teenagers, discovering sexuality and falling in love. Next, it’s presumed, comes adulthood, and then death, and then resurrection via blobs of data with four tempers.\n\nAnd apparently, with death come sacrificial scapegoats. A show as rich in symbols, details, and Easter eggs as this one is always going to be thrilling to decode, with Reddit threads and screenshots trying to make sense of the mysteries. The challenge for the finale was offering just enough to keep hard-core Severance-heads engaged without alienating the less committed viewer or relinquishing the qualities that make for satisfying television. And, for the most part, “Cold Harbor” succeeded. The rest of the season, though, had more than a few bugs in its system. Is Mark, after undergoing a process designed to reintegrate his two minds, still severed or not? Who actually is Reghabi, the ex-Lumon employee doing brain surgery on Mark in his basement? Is Ricken, Mark’s offbeat brother-in-law, anything more than comic relief? The revelation that so many of Lumon’s core characters, including Harmony Cobel, have been damaged by both trauma and repetitive exposure to ether as children might help explain their sheer strangeness. But the show’s focus on expanding the historical lore of Lumon this season left it less time to devote to its characters, the verbose and truly fascinating Milchick among them. (Severance: The Lexington Letter, a fictional e-book released to accompany the series, hints that Milchick is related to a newspaper editor, which perhaps explains his love of words.)\n\nLast week, The Guardian posited that Severance has become the smash it has because it offers different things to different tastes (or even different tempers): puzzle-box mythology, workplace comedy, allusions to cultlike organizations and the heartlessness of corporate America, an overarching sense of dread. But for me, what makes the show so captivating is its humanity: the riveting, fleeting moments when the characters feel real, despite the eggy, etherized monstrousness of the world they’re trapped in. Should Severance return for a third season (which it seems fated to—praise Kier), all the pieces seem set up for more ambitious, absurd storytelling. But I’ll still be craving justice for Gemma.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The first time that Mehmet Oz was questioned by the Senate, in June 2014, the atmosphere was not inviting. He’d been hauled in to defend his habit of promoting unconventional supplements for weight loss, including green coffee beans, raspberry ketones, and an Asian tropical fruit called garcinia cambogia, on his daytime-television talk show. “I don’t get why you need to say this stuff,” Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who chaired the hearing, told him. “Because you know it’s not true.”\n\nLast Friday, Oz was back before the Senate, this time to be questioned as President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In the interim, despite a turn to politics that included an unsuccessful bid to join the Senate himself, Oz has stayed the course: selling stress-relieving shrubs on social media, for instance, and leveraging his mother’s Alzheimer’s to pitch herbal remedies. Now a physician who was once described by other doctors in an open letter as demonstrating “an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain” may soon be tasked with regulating the health insurance of more than 150 million Americans. But the context of his return to Washington has cast the former TV star in a new, more flattering light: Next to some of the other appointees to the Department of Health and Human Services, even Dr. Oz seems safe and normal.\n\nI’ve had a front-row seat for Oz’s unlikely transformation from maligned to mainstream. In 2013, when I was still in medical school, I launched a public effort to censure him. His exuberant pitches for unproven remedies were harming patients, I contended. I asked medical societies to do more to combat the spread of misinformation. My efforts were rebuffed at first; doctors were worried about infringing on free speech and criticizing professional colleagues. To buttress my campaign, I started collecting anecdotes from viewers of The Dr. Oz Show describing potential harm caused by his advice.\n\nOz did not respond to any of these efforts at the time. (He also did not respond to a request for comment on this story.) His initial dressing-down in Congress followed soon after, and then in 2015, I helped a group of medical students and residents cajole the American Medical Association into writing guidelines for ethical physician conduct in the media. Oz himself remained unchastened after this previous run of bad press, though. “We will not be silenced. We will not give in,” he told his TV viewers in 2015, while accusing one group of critics of having industry ties and denying that he ever promoted treatments for personal gain. In short, he embraced his reputation as a wellness guru and anti-establishment truth teller—the sort of person who would find a natural home in the “Make America healthy again” movement that has been popularized by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOz is likely to join Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services—and assume control of my parents’ health insurance, among so many others’—in the weeks ahead. That prospect would have terrified me in the 2010s, when I first watched him testify before the Senate. But when I saw him do so for a second time on Friday, he no longer struck me as a major threat. Rather, he looked like an anachronism: a charming celebrity physician with a penchant for theatrical claims. In the face of the Trump administration’s chaotic razing of the nation’s biomedical infrastructure, Oz’s brand of hucksterism seems relatively mild, even quaint.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the Senate showed so little interest in his history of hawking suspect treatments. Even Democrats went pretty easy with their questions. Senator Ron Wyden accused Oz of having engaged in “wellness grifting,” and Senator Maggie Hassan said he’d backed “unproven snake oil remedies,” but this was not a central focus of the hearing. “There are many things I said on the show,” Oz said in response. “I take great pride in the research we did at the time to identify which of these worked and which ones didn’t.”\n\nInstead of grilling Oz on his questionable supplement endorsements, the legislators mostly used their time to lobby for niche policy fixes, and Oz in turn displayed an expertise in health-care policy that seemed worthy of his Wharton MBA. He was fluent on the topics of pharmacy benefit managers, prior authorization, insurance payment models, and the Affordable Care Act. He came out in favor of work requirements for Medicaid—a conventionally conservative approach—while also making sure to show some sympathy for health-care consumers, calling the insurance companies that profit from excessive upcoding “scoundrels who are stealing from the vulnerable.”\n\nThis all came off as rather serious and boring, in the way that such a hearing really should come off. Compare that with the nomination hearings for Kennedy: When questioned by the Senate, he botched basic facts about Medicare and Medicaid, refused to admit that vaccines don’t cause autism, and accused committee members of being shills for pharmaceutical companies. Dave Weldon, who was Trump’s pick to run the CDC, didn’t even make it to his hearing, which was also scheduled for last week. Why Weldon’s nomination was withdrawn is not exactly clear, but it’s possible he made the error of being slightly too transparent about his suspicions of standard childhood vaccines. When positioned next to Kennedy and Weldon, or to Trump’s picks to run the NIH and the FDA, Oz seems quite conventional. He clearly stated that the measles shot is both safe and effective, while doing little to attach himself to the angry COVID contrarianism expressed by Kennedy and other nominees for leadership at HHS. (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nSo now we seem to have arrived at the strange moment when a celebrity TV doctor with no significant experience in public administration, a physician who once suggested that pineapple chunks and chia seeds were reasonable treatments for sciatica, can present himself as an unusually rational and stable candidate for leadership in the nation’s public-health establishment. Oz may even become an advocate for a more conventional approach to health-care policy in a department that is now run by someone who touts the benefits of treating measles with cod liver oil. Improbably, the “green coffee beans” guy is poised to be the grown-up in the room.",

        "content": "Sign up for Trump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nBack when Rahm Emanuel was President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, the idea that a political operative once nicknamed Rahmbo could be a viable candidate to succeed his boss would have seemed a little far-fetched. But when Emanuel suggested to Politico last week that he was considering a run, what was previously unimaginable suddenly made some sense. Emanuel, also a former mayor of Chicago, has a reputation for being a bulldozer. He has little time for niceties. He articulates his ideas in bombastic and often quite pungent sentences. As the former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod, who spent years working closely with Emanuel, has said, “He understands how to win and speaks bluntly in an idiom that most folks understand.” That’s the nice way to put it. His style is tough, and tough is what the Democrats seem to be looking for.\n\nWhether or not he has a real shot, Emanuel is very politically astute, and he understands that this might be his moment. The same could be said of Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor. When challenged over his tarnished record—the small matter of having resigned as governor over numerous allegations of sexual harassment—he is counterpunching with his record of hardheadedness. (Cuomo has denied wrongdoing but has said he is “truly sorry” for instances that were “misinterpreted as unwanted flirtation.”) “We don’t need a Mr. Nice Guy. We need a Mr. Tough Guy,” Representative Ritchie Torres said in his endorsement of Cuomo. Last month, speaking to donors, the former governor said he saw Donald Trump as a “bully in the schoolyard.” And Cuomo knows how to handle bullies. “He puts his finger in your chest,” Cuomo said. “And if you take one step back, he’s going to continue to put his finger in your chest.” You put a finger in his chest, Cuomo seemed to imply, and he’ll break it.\n\n“What if the path to Democratic Party renewal was always just to bring back the biggest assholes, like Rahm and Andrew Cuomo?” the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, a Trump supporter, posted on X.\n\nAs Emanuel might have put it, maybe it takes an asshole to fight one. At least that’s what polling is picking up. A new NBC survey found that 65 percent of Democrats want their lawmakers to oppose Trump even if it leads to gridlock, compared with 32 percent who are willing to broach some compromise. (These numbers were practically flipped when the same question was asked roughly this far into Trump’s first term.) And in a poll conducted by Ruffini, 57 percent of Democrats said they approved of Representative Al Green’s cane-waving disruption of Trump’s recent congressional address.\n\nDavid A. Graham: America’s Andrew Cuomo problem\n\nThis desire for roughness has erupted into scathing anger over the past few days, finding its target in Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose style is more Mr. Beloved Uncle With a Stain on His Shirt than Mr. Tough Guy. Schumer decided not to block the Republicans’ spending bill, thereby avoiding a government shutdown. His reasons were legitimate; not only would Trump relish the chance to blame the shutdown on the Democrats (surely schumer shutdown bumper stickers were already being printed), but a shutdown would give Trump the power to close government agencies and programs he deemed “nonessential”—Schumer worried specifically about food stamps—and the pain would have been counterproductive to Democratic interests. The argument for a shutdown was simpler: Do something, anything. Many Democratic lawmakers argued that signing on to the spending bill would make them look as if they were acquiescing to DOGE’s power grab. Even Nancy Pelosi, a longtime Schumer comrade, called his decision “unacceptable.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries offered the Capitol Hill equivalent of a shiv in the back when he was asked whether the Senate needed new leadership. “Next question,” he said.\n\nI’m sympathetic to Schumer, who was thinking about the actual implications of a shutdown beyond the performance and the politics. But he is in the wrong movie. Democrats are desperate for someone to start poking their own finger into Trump’s chest. The only problem is that they have no leverage at the moment; the shutdown was pretty much the only sand congressional Democrats had to throw in the gears. How else could they show their constituents their fighting spirit?\n\nToughness, as a value, has long been a fixture in American politics—but it has been inescapable since 2016. In interview after interview following the latest election, voters told reporters that Trump’s pumping fist, raised seconds after July’s assassination attempt, sealed the deal for them. Even before the incident, he was often styled in MAGA social media as, yes, Rambo.\n\nTrump’s style has worked for him, and it makes sense that Democrats, who are dejected and more unpopular than ever, are looking to answer mano with mano. Commentators are already forecasting a liberal version of the Tea Party movement, the grassroots backlash to Obama’s win in 2008 that coalesced around the idea that establishment Republicans were too weak to fight him. The movement was short on actual policy, besides a desire to kill the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes and regulations. What it had plenty of was anger—against elites, against the perceived foreignness of America’s first Black president, against a globalizing world. Behind the anger was a push for toughness, and in that arena, the Tea Party bore fruit: The 2010 midterms brought in a wave of more ideologically rigid congressional members. It elevated bullying as an end in itself, and set the stage for Trump.\n\nI’m not sure toughness will work for candidates who merely attempt to mirror Trump’s modus operandi. For one thing, Democrats seem to have less patience for the kind of shamelessness and blame-shifting that are the president’s trademark. Emanuel and Cuomo are on the comeback trail precisely because they have already offended Democratic voters through Trumpian behavior. When he was mayor of Chicago, Emanuel was widely condemned for mishandling the police shooting of a Black teenager, Laquan McDonald, in part by delaying the release of damning dashcam footage for more than a year. The resulting ill will played no small part in his decision not to run for reelection in 2019. As for Cuomo, some say the directive his administration issued early in the coronavirus pandemic, requiring nursing homes to accept patients who had tested positive, greatly spread the virus and caused death. Then a New York state audit found that Cuomo had underreported those deaths by as much as 50 percent. The sexual-harassment allegations added fuel to a Democratic backlash that was already in motion.\n\nRahm Emanuel: How not to lose to Donald Trump\n\nEven when it comes to style, Democrats need to beware of copying and pasting. When Tim Walz, the former vice-presidential candidate, drops his aura of midwestern nice to call Elon Musk a “dipshit” and a “South African nepo baby,” as he did in front of an audience the other day, it just sounds a little strained and ridiculous. Take also Gavin Newsom, the governor of California and currently a very possible contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028. In a much-mocked effort to show his ability to cut it in the manosphere, he has been hosting a podcast and has brought on right-wing figures including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon as guests.\n\nThe Bannon episode looked like a split screen of styles. Bannon talked over and through Newsom’s questions, goading the governor at certain points, gently mocking him at others. Newsom brought none of this heat, starting many sentences with “I appreciate that” no matter what provocations Bannon had just uttered. At one point, they found convergence in their hatred of Musk, arguing only over which one of them was more culpable for empowering the tech titan. Newsom tried to land his blows—“You seriously want Starlink to take over the FAA?”—but he was no match for Bannon’s snarling. Even in jeans and an open-collared shirt, Newsom looked like he’d be more comfortable at a French Laundry dinner party than on a pugilistic podcast.\n\nDemocrats would be better off finding their own model of toughness—not one that extols aggression and strong-arming. Maybe they should channel, as the Democratic strategist James Carville suggested, the fighting technique of the older Muhammad Ali: rope-a-dope. Absorb punches until Trump tires himself out or, more likely, the American people get tired of all the chaos and disruption. This might be what Schumer has in mind.\n\nOr maybe there is another kind of toughness, something more like the wiliness of a survivor. When you have no leverage, when your party is polling at 27 percent approval, you also have nothing to lose. The way to counter the destructiveness of DOGE, if you can’t literally stop it, is to put out a barrage of creative ideas, to flood the zone with stuff that will inevitably be better than anything Trump or Musk has to offer. Democrats believe in government, so they tend to govern better, while Republicans are better at campaigning, because they oppose it. This strength is hard to show off when you’re not actually in power, but maybe what’s called for is a shadow Cabinet, like those organized by British opposition parties, with the Democrats demonstrating, day after day, what they could do if they were in charge. The writer Timothy Snyder suggested something like this in January, arguing that it might “remind us of how much better things can be.”\n\nTo crib Isaiah Berlin’s famously overused metaphor, Democrats are foxes and Republicans (especially MAGA ones) are hedgehogs. The hedgehog’s advantage is to have one core narrative that explains everything, and hammer it with force, whereas the fox knows many things, and can think a few steps ahead. In politics, being a fox is not always preferable or easy, especially in a media environment that loves itself a hedgehog. But it has also proved to be a winning approach before. Bill Clinton and Obama were, let’s remember, successful foxes; they knew how to juggle priorities, how to code switch, how to parry a punch. It’s precisely in such a fallow moment that it makes sense for Democrats to rediscover this other kind of toughness.\n\nFinding someone to out-Trump Trump might look like an expedient solution to an immediate problem. But it also means fighting a war that the Democrats have already lost.",

        "content": "Maybe you were one of the 11.7 million people who watched when, on House M.D., the genius diagnostician Gregory House is roused in the middle of the night by a pounding at the door. A man he just gave a clean bill of health has collapsed and died. House and his colleague Eric Foreman decide to perform an autopsy themselves. Eager to see the man’s heart, House pushes Foreman to plunge a whirring saw into the patient’s sternum. They peer down: Blood seems to be trickling from the wound. “That’s odd,” says Foreman, “almost looks like he’s … bleeding?” There’s a beat. Then the man’s eyes open wide and he screams.\n\nIf you missed this particular episode, you’ve surely seen something similar. Autopsies play a starring role on CSI, Bones, and many other prime-time dramas about medicine and forensics. They may very well be the medical procedure that Americans have been most exposed to via their screens, and yet among the most misunderstood. The way these shows depict autopsies is so disastrously wrong that they not only discourage families from opting into these vital procedures; they even diminish doctors’ understanding of how autopsies work.\n\nOn television, autopsies happen in dark rooms with blue light. They involve scalpels, bone saws. Jaded techs in lab coats discuss ligature marks and defensive wounds. Doctors frown at something mysterious and disturbing. Many (but not all) of the pathologists performing autopsies are maladjusted weirdos; the nonspecialist doctors, like House, do things that would cause them to lose their medical license. In one episode of Grey’s Anatomy, Sandra Oh’s and Katherine Heigl’s characters carry out an autopsy in direct contravention of the patient and family’s orders, which is, need I say, illegal; in another, the autopsy pathologist callously chews gum and makes a dinner reservation while cutting. In just about every single episode of CSI, techs wearing no protective equipment whatsoever stand in rooms lit like dive bars, feeding slivers of human tissue into machines that whir briefly and spit out a neat list of every foreign substance in the body.\n\nMost Americans will never see a real autopsy, so our impressions of them are formed by TV portrayals. That’s how it was for me, until I spent two weeks observing autopsies in a hospital in Pittsburgh as part of research for a novel. In real life, autopsies are performed in brightly lit rooms. (Forensic autopsies must sometimes be completed in the field if, for example, a body cannot be safely moved.) The autopsist begins with a Y-shaped incision into the sternum and works methodically through the body. Sometimes the internal organs are inspected in situ, but more typically they are removed, washed down, and dissected on a water table. The autopsist doesn’t just pick up an organ, look at it, make a diagnosis, and plop it back in; rather, they catalog as many of the body’s pathologies as possible, whether or not they’re suspected of causing death. They also take care to make sure that none of the evidence of this inspection would be visible in an open-casket funeral. It’s slow, comprehensive work that rarely involves fancy electronics.\n\nPerhaps the most subtly ridiculous aspect of TV autopsies is the lack of personal protective equipment. In real autopsies, the people involved wear head-to-toe PPE—surgical scrubs, armguards, booties, an apron, a face mask, a splash shield, and a cap—because, when you open a human body up, all the blood, bile, and other fluids that a person had in life are still in there. Blood can still ooze from a wound, even when it’s not being pumped through the body. Did the writers of that House M.D. episode think the human body spontaneously exsanguinates when the heart stops?\n\nErrors like these in TV depictions reduce autopsies to ghoulish spectacles, when the procedure is in fact a respectful and uniquely useful tool for understanding how a person lived and died. Families might decline an autopsy for a number of reasons: cultural taboos, simple squeamishness, a sense that the decedent has suffered enough, a desire to take possession of the body right away. But a death need not reach some threshold of suspicion or mystery to merit investigation; many teaching hospitals, where residents might observe autopsies to deepen their understanding of anatomy, will perform an autopsy for free on any patient if the family asks. Anyone can get one, and more people should.\n\nAutopsies, even in cases where death was expected, can serve a real purpose to the living. They help present a full narrative of disease, which can help doctors treat other patients and—if communicated well—allow grieving families to move toward acceptance. Autopsies can catch hereditary illnesses that doctors tend to miss, such as signet-ring-cell carcinomas, and reveal causes of dementia that may have been misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s. Even in suicides, where the cause of death is usually obvious, autopsies can reveal underlying problems that might have contributed to the deceased’s distress.\n\nRead: There are no ‘five stages’ of grief\n\nDespite how useful autopsies are, they have become an endangered species. In one survey conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital in the mid-2000s, residents overwhelmingly said they had never watched an autopsy, much less performed one. And doctors aren’t always comfortable discussing them with patients’ families. Autopsy rates more than halved from 1972 to 2007, plunging to a measly 8.3 percent. In many other countries, the rate is even lower.\n\nNot all hospitals provide autopsy services; in many of those that do, asking the family of a deceased patient whether they would like an autopsy falls to residents, many of whom lack the training to properly describe and clarify the process. In that moment, there’s little to stop the grieving family from calling up all the lurid images they’ve likely seen on TV. Take, for example, a 2020 episode of The Good Doctor literally called “Autopsy.” Shaun Murphy is operating on an ER patient, an unhoused Jane Doe, when her carotid artery “blows out” and she bleeds to death in a matter of seconds. Over the next 40 minutes of screen time, the following things happen:\n\nThe hospital denies Murphy permission to do an autopsy. (Apparently, arteries explode every day.) So he tracks down the woman’s estranged son, who also denies him, inspiring Murphy to attack the man’s car, shrieking at him. Nonetheless, the head of pathology (who just broke up with Murphy) allows him to do the procedure. He conducts the autopsy himself, in a dark room and wearing no PPE beyond a cute little apron, while the pathologist stands indulgently behind him. He plucks out the woman’s liver and regards it briefly, then puts it back and exits, without sewing her up or taking a tissue sample. Finally, he shows up at the son’s house to say that his mother had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is hereditary, and that the son must get treatment. All is forgiven.\n\nThis is an episode that makes a case for autopsies. The only remotely realistic thing about the episode is the son’s reluctance to consent. And after watching that gruesome exercise, would you?\n\nRead: Health care in the time of Grey’s Anatomy\n\nOn these shows, the stark truth of a dead body is either milked for shock factor or smoothed over with holograms. Each chemical in a person’s body can be identified with a machine, and each story has a satisfying ending. Everyone knows life isn’t like that. We need to accept that death isn’t, either.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "To start with an unpopular opinion: I loved With Love, Meghan, Netflix’s goofy new lifestyle series, in which Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, smiles winningly in a Montecito kitchen that is not her own, making the hokey jokes you typically find stitched on Etsy home goods (“bready or not, here I crumb”), underbaking cakes, and strewing edible flowers on everything that crosses her path. I loved how Meghan’s core kitchen skills appear to be arranging vegetables on a $326 cutting board and emphasizing every single consonant in the word preserves. I loved when she praised carnations as a humble, budget-friendly flower, then “elevated” them by sticking one (1) into the middle of maybe a thousand dollars worth of peonies. I even loved when she made avocado toast for a quick solo breakfast—who among us?—though I screamed out loud when she promptly sprinkled edible flowers on top.\n\nBy now, you may have seen the memes—TikTok jokers radiating cheer and offering tutorials on how to “prepare” glasses of water. They skewer one of the show’s key contradictions, which is that Meghan, though lovable, is maybe in truth not very good at domestic goddessery. In the first episode, tending to “her” bees, she relies on a beekeeper, a man who could easily be Fred Armisen doing a Portlandia bit. “We’ve been doing this for over a year now, but I still need you,” she tells him, smiling. Later, she confesses, “I’ve never liked honey.” When Meghan and Mindy Kaling prepare food for a children’s tea party to which no children actually show up, the finger sandwiches look less like high-tea offerings and more like the scraps in the duchess’s chicken coop. Making tacos with a chef, she has to be told to use two forks to shred chicken breasts or she’ll burn her fingers. She is, however, extremely skilled at opening champagne—no one has popped this many bottles in the lifestyle realm since Martha got out of prison or Ina went through pandemic lockdown.\n\nRead: The many contradictions of Martha Stewart\n\nWatching the show, I found myself stuck on one question: Who is this for? Is there an underserved niche of Santa Barbara moms with their own pristine vegetable gardens who’ve previously been too intimidated to attempt baking focaccia? And yet, as With Love, Meghan went on, it started to hit a few of the classic pleasure points. A beautiful woman with a wardrobe of stealth-wealth beige separates and floral dresses? Check. A fixation, both nutritional and aesthetic, on how best to feed one’s family, down to fruit platters arranged like rainbows and jars of chia seeds and hemp hearts to sneak into pancakes? Check. A strange aside where she details what it meant for her to take her husband’s name? Ding ding ding: We’re in tradwife territory now. This is absurd, of course. Meghan isn’t a tradwife; if anything, she’s a girlboss, a savvy, mediagenic entrepreneur with a new podcast dedicated to businesswomen and a nascent retail brand. So why does she seem to be trying so hard to rebrand as one, offering up this wistful performance of femininity and old-fashioned domestic arts that feels staged—and pretty familiar?\n\nIn a world in which 99.999 percent of women’s labor at home goes unseen and unappreciated, tradwives demand visibility—cut loose from the demands of a 9-to-5 job, they promise, we women can free ourselves to make the things we already do more beautiful, and to find meaning in everyday routines by turning chores into homemaking. The most notorious tradwives on social media turn domestic labor into intoxicating content; think Hannah Neeleman churning butter (with a KitchenAid) or Nara Smith whispering over videos of herself carving up pork butt while wearing a scarlet couture gown. With Love, Meghan does exactly the same thing, affirming the home as Meghan’s sanctuary after a bruising, very public introduction to married life, and the acts she performs for friends and family as labors of real love.\n\nBut there’s also a playacting component to the show that it can’t quite shake off. Most of us, I’d safely bet, have made pasta, possibly even while another person watches. But we don’t imbue the process with so much meaning. Meghan doesn’t just entertain, she explains on the show; she makes elaborate rituals out of the act of hosting, baking dog biscuits from scratch for one dear friend (who arrives regrettably sans dog) and creating a welcome basket for a beloved former makeup artist, right down to handmixed bath salts and snacks in beribboned bags. Partly, this seems practical—Meghan might not be a trained chef entirely set up for her own cooking show, but her calligraphy skills and decorative abilities are second to none. The word beautiful is peppered throughout every scene, emphasizing Meghan’s key aspiration of prettifying domestic life. Her friends appreciate these efforts—of course they do! But they’re also stiff and slightly awkward on camera, which is perhaps what all the wine is for.\n\nRead: MomTok is the apotheosis of 21st-century womanhood\n\nThe overall vibe is one of delightful leisure. “We might have a busy floral day today,” Meghan says, visiting a flower market and walking out with armfuls of bouquets, like she’s in a horticultural episode of Supermarket Sweep. By contrast, I’ve spent the past few months watching Neeleman, the superstar influencer also known as Ballerina Farm, attend cooking school in Ireland, a 12-week sojourn—her husband and eight children have accompanied her—in which, for once, she seems unafraid to show how hard she’s working. She posts about the duck entrées that go wrong, the prep work for kitchen shifts, the late nights. And I’ve appreciated the transparency of someone really showing the arduousness of her efforts, not just cosplaying scenes of kitchen congress for Instagram. Most of the content creators whom we’ve come to identify as tradwives are more apt to hide both their home labor and the fact that they do indeed have jobs (as influencers).\n\nIf the goal is inducing aspiration, With Love, Meghan is indeed “beautiful.” Walking into the room while I was watching, my husband asked if this was “one of those movies with the kitchens,” by which he meant the oeuvre of Nancy Meyers—possibly the biggest compliment any Southern California lifestyle influencer could hope for. If Meghan’s fake garden is this colorful and bounteous, her fake pantry this blissfully stocked, can you imagine the real thing? I don’t begrudge her any of her hard-won happiness making crepes to mop up all her preserves, or getting Roy Choi to help her make fried chicken. (If you watch any one episode, make it that one, because Choi really can cook, and his chemistry with Meghan is the kind people watch morning television for.) But her series, ultimately, is best appreciated as anthropological study—what impossibly wealthy women do for love and fulfillment—rather than a model for how the rest of us should enact our labors: half as care and half as performance.",

Here’s what I think about that:\n\nTwo important things about sex\n\nmust be clearly and constantly stated.\n\nOne: It’s the greatest thing in the world.\n\nTwo: It’s quite overrated.\n\nUnder current conditions, the laws of time and space, etc., choosing a partner means un-choosing all the other partners. It’s not a brilliant system, but it’s what we have. Either you whirl around incontinently, “intimate moments of multiple varieties” a-go-go, or you pledge your genitals to one person and settle down to await … whatever happens next.\n\nEros, the uncontrollable spirit, the force that through the green fuse drives the flower, is mounting a bit of an assault on your imagination right now. This is completely normal. It’s not going to stop, either. Eros hates domesticity; Eros hates a sensible choice. Eros even hates the right choice—which is twisted, but there we are.\n\nDon’t worry about the “happily ever after” just yet. One thing at a time. (Also, “happily ever after” doesn’t exist.) Move in together; see how that feels. Treat your dreaming libido as an itch rather than an imperative: You don’t have to act on or indulge its every flutter. Unmet needs are like pull-ups for the spirit. Your nostalgia for Hinge is not a problem, in my view, until you go back on Hinge. At that point, it’ll be time for a rethink.\n\nOn your team,\n\nJames\n\nDear James,\n\nMore than 20 years ago, when I went through a long-distance breakup while abroad, I didn’t care about getting back any of my things. Yet my ex-boyfriend spent a lot of time and money packaging and shipping everything to my relatives’ American address.\n\nFor a long time afterward, I remained too hurt, bitter, and poorer than him to even want to think about it. But now, all these years later, I feel like I should have contributed to the cost and should at least make the offer. I’m not sure why. Maybe the thought has crossed my mind because his children are probably going to start college soon, and the money, I figure, might be helpful to him. Or maybe it’s because the causes we once both believed in seem doomed today—they could possibly use some money, and he might donate what I send him.\n\nI mentioned the thought to my husband, who thinks it would look strange to make an overdue offer so many years later—especially because I didn’t really stay in touch, except for a couple of emails or letters in the years immediately following the breakup.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDear Reader,\n\nI think this is a good idea. I agree with your husband: It will look strange. But so what? “Better late than never” is one of my go-to proverbs. (And I’m always late, so I go to it a lot.)\n\nPerhaps even more important than the money here is the belated acknowledgment of the effort your ex put into taking care of your stuff in the aftermath of your breakup. Whatever else went down—the rights and wrongs, the who-said-what, the foaming water under the bridge—in that respect, he looked after you. With even a certain dogged gallantry. You know all of this, of course, so go ahead and make it right: Rebalance this situation, for yourself as much as for him.\n\nBlowing kisses to my debtors,\n\nJames",

This particular dream is of a world in which clean, abundant energy flows from nuclear plants and rooftop solar panels; medical advancements have made life better and longer; and artificial intelligence has come not to doom us but to save us from the drudgeries of work. This is the shared vision—part techno-optimism, part liberal reverie—put forth by The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson and The New York Times’ Ezra Klein in their new book, Abundance.\n\nIn their telling, what stands between humanity and this future are not just the usual culprits—conservatives and Big Business—but also liberals. The self-described champions of clean energy, transit, and affordable housing have allowed those goals to fall by the wayside while they prioritize onerous regulations, processes, and a myriad of competing interest groups.\n\nOn today’s episode of Good on Paper, Thompson and Klein join the show to talk about why states like California and New York struggle to achieve the priorities they claim to have. Why is high-speed rail nothing but a dream? Why does Texas build more utility-scale solar than California? Why is New York, a state run by Democrats, unable to tackle its affordable-housing crisis?\n\n“My first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics,” Klein told me. “But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there?”\n\n“Liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism,” Thompson added. “Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.”\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: The United States is the wealthiest nation on Earth, at a time when the world is richer than it ever has been, and yet our politics are defined by scarcity. Scarcity of housing, of energy, and even of space has allowed zero-sum thinking to permeate the electorate, and that has been a boon for the forces of illiberalism.\n\nDonald Trump rode to victory last November fueled by zero-sum thinking. If there’s not enough to go around, then he’s your man. And now the question is whether the liberal response will be to fight him on his own terms or change the script.\n\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\n\nIn a new book out today titled Abundance, by The New York Times’ Ezra Klein and The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson, the authors argue for a sea change in how liberals have approached politics. It’s a great book; we’ll put the link in our show notes. And I’m quoting from them here:\n\n“We imagine a future not of less but of more. We do not subscribe to the seductive ideologies of scarcity. We will not get more or better jobs by closing our gates to immigrants. We will not turn back climate change by persuading the world to starve itself of growth. It is not merely that these visions are unrealistic. It is that they are counterproductive. They will not achieve the futures they seek. They will do more harm than good.”\n\nThat paragraph is like catnip for people opposed to Donald Trump, but there are some very difficult intra-coalitional fights that will have to be waged in order for this world of abundance to become reality—because what’s standing in the way of abundant housing, transportation networks, and renewable energy is not only Republicans in Washington, D.C., but Democrats in California, New York, Massachusetts, and beyond.\n\nIt is Democrats who have stood up policies and practices that have allowed scarcity to fester in their own states, fueling a cost-of-living crisis unparalleled in Republican-led jurisdictions.\n\nHere to talk to me about this are the authors of Abundance. Ezra, Derek, welcome to the show!\n\nEzra Klein: Thank you. Good to be here.\n\nDerek Thompson: Great to be here, Jerusalem.\n\nDemsas: You guys co-wrote a book, and in the book, you write “our” and “we” a lot. And I had a fun time playing mini detective, trying to decipher which parts felt more Derek and which ones felt more Ezra. But what were some places of disagreement you discovered while writing the book? Are there ways you think differently about the problems of scarcity, Derek?\n\nThompson: I don’t think we disagree in the conclusions of the book, but I do think that our approaches are different. I think that I’ve never really been a politics-first writer or a politics-first podcaster. And when I wrote the original abundance-agenda essay, that was me dipping my toe into politics.\n\nAnd I’ve always felt a little bit more comfortable starting with economics or technology and then working my way into politics. And so I think that working with Ezra, who is so much more versed in modern politics and political history, was really educational in terms of thinking about many of the ideas that I debuted in that abundance-agenda essay as firmly political issues.\n\nAnd I think that as we worked together and talked on the phone and read each other’s drafts, there was a theme that’s not present in that original abundance essay, really very much at all, that we began to see as being absolutely essential for this book, which is the theme of: If you’re going to remake liberalism for the next generation, you have to take very seriously the shortcomings of liberalism in the previous generation. And that, for me, just speaking entirely personally, is something that absolutely emerged in conversations with Ezra, rather than appeared initially in my first conception of an abundance book about progress.\n\nSo that’s, I think, one place where it’s not so much a matter of disagreement as a matter of, sort of, our differences in approach leading to what I think is a very fruitful combination.\n\nKlein: So I think you can really see the differences between Derek and my approach if you just look at the titles of our two original essays here. So Derek, as he mentioned, had this great piece on abundance, and, you know, the framing of that is so sunny and optimistic, and everybody’s for abundance. And my piece was called “The Economic Mistake the Left Is Finally Confronting,” and I called it “supply-side progressivism.”\n\nAnd in that way, I think one of the really great things about working together on this is that Derek brings, I think, a forward-looking, sunnier optimism. And I bring a somewhat hard-nosed, Where the fuck did all this policy go wrong? you know, jaded-policy-reporter sense that I think creates a book that has the two sides of the coin that it needs.\n\nDemsas: Despite growing up on the East Coast—I feel like I’ve said this to Derek a bunch of times—he’s, like, the most West Coast East Coaster I’ve ever met, just perennially optimistic about the future.\n\nKlein: Sure. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: In a way, that just seems super wrong. But, Ezra, you’re actually from the West Coast, so it’s like you’re switching.\n\nKlein: I’m the West Coaster, which is why I’m so pissed, because I was in California while doing all this work and thinking about why California was performing so terribly, despite being the greatest state the world has ever known.\n\nDemsas: So I’m going to ask you to harness some of that anger now, Ezra. So who are the roadblocks to abundant housing, clean energy, transportation, and tech innovation? Give me a villain.\n\nKlein: Just a nice, small question there.\n\nDemsas: Yes, exactly.\n\nKlein: Well, they’re different in the different areas. I think that’s one thing to say.\n\nBut I’ve thought about the set of roadblocks here as in different categories. So one is interests. You can think about trying to build an affordable-housing complex in San Francisco, and you get interests that are lined up against it for different reasons.\n\nSo one set of interests might be local homeowners who do not want a six-story affordable-housing complex down the block from them. They think it’ll hurt their parking. They think it will bring people they don’t want to the neighborhood. They think it’ll hurt their home values. So that’s very classic. Then you might have—depending on how this is built, you might have—unions, right? If the complex does not want to use union labor or does not want to pay prevailing wages, or they want to do modular construction off-site—as in one of the examples I reported on—you might have unions begin to fight that. You also have, just in general then, what I think of as policy drift. So there are certain programs, procedures, approaches that came into being at one time, maybe without anybody even really noticing it, and they become binding and difficult over time, but nobody’s ever revisited.\n\nSo again, holding on to the affordable-housing example, there is this kind of strange process in San Francisco—it was in California, I guess, but this specifically in San Francisco—around this thing called 14, I think, B or D; I forget which one. It began life as a racial preference. So it was meant to give the—in city contracts, you would have a preference for minority-owned contractors. Then the California Supreme Court—or no. I’m sorry. It was actually a proposition. California voters said, You can’t do that.\n\nSo then they went back, and the state, the city of San Francisco edited that procedure. And they said, Now it’s for small businesses and subcontractors, micro subcontractors, right? We, in San Francisco, have a rooting interest in making sure we have a healthy small-business ecosystem, and so there’s going to be a preference here for small businesses over big contractors, either in the city of San Francisco or even coming in from the outside.\n\nAnd everybody kind of knows that, in terms of how the city looks at it, it’s still sort of also a racial preference, if you can get there. But specifically, in language, it is a small-business preference. Most people just don’t know that’s there. That’s not really interests—I mean, small subcontractors do. But in general, that’s not a well-known thing. It’s not even doing the thing it was initially intended to do. So just over time, it’s become more binding. It’s drifted. It’s become a kind of procedural crust that I think would not be passed into law today if somebody was thinking about it. So that’s another one.\n\nThen you have sort of overlapping and complex authorities. You get this a lot in environmental issues. So, like, when you’re dealing with transmission lines, the number of players who have to sign off on something: Sometimes it’s local; sometimes it’s state. There’s overlapping federal authorities. That’s really difficult. You have very fractured authority. Nobody can consistently make the decision. So you begin to just have sort of category after category of things that, when you stack them, it just makes it very, very hard to get anything done.\n\nBut they’re not all ideological. They’re not all interest based. They’re not all anything. It is the problem of, as Steve Teles once called it, like, a “kludgeocracy” that has evolved over, you know, many decades.\n\nThompson: Let me jump in there. I think Ezra provided a really nice zoom-out answer from the local individual level to the higher-level factions and groups, starting with voters and homeowners, moving to economic factions, moving to the regulatory and legislative drift that exists in the laws and rules that are written, and then the overlapping authorities.\n\nI do want to introduce here the most macro answer to your question, Jerusalem, Who’s standing in the way of progress? Sometimes, it’s just the federal government, and I think it’s sometimes the federal government, in terms of the way that a lot of these policies that seem to be policies that would forward progressive ends end up stymieing progressive ends. There’s an incredible echo of that story that’s unfolded in the rollout of broadband-internet construction across the country after the Biden infrastructure bill.\n\nAnd so the top-line headline that I think a lot of people read in the Politico article, or other articles about the slow rollout of broadband construction, is that Biden authorized $42 billion to build broadband internet, and just a fraction of that money was spent, because of the paperwork required.\n\nBut why wasn’t the money spent? Why didn’t we actually do what we wanted to do? And I was asking people about this at a dinner that I went to recently, where everything was on background and not for attribution. But, you know, suffice it to say that people at this dinner had job titles that made it very clear that their testimony was highly relevant to the question of why it was hard to build rural broadband in this country when the government put $42 billion behind the effort.\n\nAnd their answer was: It wasn’t so much about the language of the legislation as the funding rules published by the Commerce Department that had workforce requirements and pricing requirements and climate-change requirements and bidding requirements, and so on and so on. And so essentially, you have the federal government saying, On the one hand, here’s federal money. Go forth and achieve a Democratic initiative, which is raising living standards for low-income Americans. I mean, just the most classic bread-and-butter progressive initiative. But also, they made the application process so onerous that nothing was built. And so, in fact, very little was actually done on behalf of the Americans for whom we wanted to raise their living standards.\n\nAnd I think this is a question that goes to—and this is a theme throughout, I think, Ezra’s answer—trade-offs in policy making and taking those trade-offs seriously. I think climate change is an important thing to care about. I don’t want the state of Virginia taking, say, federal money to build broadband internet and then charging poor rural folks, like, $200 a month to go online.\n\nBut by holding those values so closely and creating an application and funding process that extended the time that those authorized dollars were actually spent by two, three, three-and-a-half years, we accidentally built just about nothing. And now the entire program looks like it might just be, like, block granted to Elon Musk Inc. so he can do Starlink for America.\n\nSo this is what happens, I think, when at the federal level you also have this confusion of process versus outcomes, of wanting to fit everything in Ezra’s everything bagel into the process such that every you’ve stymied your ability to actually achieve the outcomes that you’ve indicated.\n\nDemsas: In both of your answers, I hear, and I think many people will hear, a critique that conservatives and libertarians have been making for a long time. From Ezra, I’m hearing, you know, there are too many interest groups that are demanding that their priorities be preferenced over the outcomes that benefit a broad number of people. And from Derek, I’m hearing pretty straightforwardly that government is standing in the way, that regulations are standing in the way, that process is standing in the way of free enterprise, of government. And in the book, you have, like, heavy citation of Mancur Olson’s work. And what distinguishes your project from the conservative kind of critique of liberalism? Is that—are you just trying to lib-wash conservatism?\n\nKlein: Goals.\n\nDemsas: Yeah?\n\nKlein: Goals, very simply. Which red state has decarbonized? Which red state is even trying? Which red state has high-speed rail? Which red state is even trying?\n\nI hear this sometimes from people, and I always think it’s weird. I always think it’s libertarians and conservatives so underselling their own project. Their project isn’t just deregulation. In many cases, they’re adding lots of new powers. Right? Like, look at their relationship to the surveillance state. Their project is to actually do things. It’s to gut Medicare and Medicaid because they feel that it is an unwise use of money to spend all that money on health insurance for poor people and the elderly.\n\nTheir project is to actively impede the construction of solar and wind [power], as we see the Trump administration doing right now. I was thinking about your question a second ago, Jerusalem, and thinking that the much cleaner answer I should have given was the villain is liberals in government who’ve oriented towards process and not outcome. The enemy is people who have said they’re going to deliver something, who believe in delivering that thing, and then have accepted process in which they do not end up delivering it, and then they explain it away, or explain away how hard they worked.\n\nBut by the way, this is how all the coalitions work. What is ultimately meaningful is outcome—the kind of world you are trying to live in, the kind of world you are trying to build. When Elon Musk and DOGE go in and decapitate USAID and cut off that funding, what they are doing, their outcome, their intention, their aim, their goal is not deregulation or cutting the federal workforce a little bit. Their aim is to stop delivering aid to poor people. That is what they believe that “America first” means: You do not spend our money preventing HIV/AIDS from infecting children in Africa. I think that’s monstrous. But that’s the aim. That’s the goal. And the means—decapitating USAID is the means to the goal.\n\nSo the difference between, I think, Derek and I, and conservatives and libertarians, is that we have different outcomes we’re trying to reach. I don’t think it makes sense for me and Donald Trump’s Department of Energy lead to debate how best to decarbonize, because he doesn’t want to decarbonize. Right? So I’ll have different things to do from that.\n\nDemsas: But does that matter? Because, I mean—\n\nKlein: Yeah.\n\nDemsas: No, but, I mean: in terms of the outcomes that you’re talking about here. So, I mean, in the book, you even cite this, but in response to your question about whether Texas has decarbonized: No, but they’re sure as hell siting a bunch of renewable energy. And when we talk about high-speed rail, I wouldn’t call it the highest-speed rail, but Brightline is reviving passenger rail in Florida; it might be reviving passenger rail in Nevada. It’s possible that Texas might even be given the opportunity to do high-speed rail now.\n\nI mean, there’s ways in which I, as a liberal myself, hear this all the time. And I struggle with this question because these places, despite their lack of interest in many of the goals that the three of us may have, are still executing on these goals.\n\nKlein: Yeah. I think that speaks to the power of defaults. And, I mean, we talk about this in the book. I mean, we cite specifically that Texas is building—and by the way, so is Georgia—a lot of renewable energy, but that’s because the default in Texas is to build things very easily. And so when the market sees an opportunity to make money building things—which, particularly under the IRA, it’s seen a very big opportunity to make money building renewable energy—it’ll be able to build it there, because they’ve simply made it straightforward. Although it is a question, I think, how long that would last for. You see a lot of political efforts in the Texas legislature to make it harder to build renewable energy.\n\nAnd now you see at the Trump level a lot of efforts to destroy the solar and, specifically, the wind industries, right? They’re actually trying to make that actively harder. So I think over time, there might be a lag before policy catches up with politics, but typically they do eventually begin to align on, you know, efficiently or inefficiently. You know, there are other things where Texas has just, like, way better affordable housing than California does, but conservatives don’t oppose affordable housing.\n\nSo I do think it’s absolutely true that you have places where there is a default, a path dependence that has made things happen even when you wouldn’t really expect it from a policy architecture. And in many ways, you know, probusiness conservatives should probably look at California and ask, Well, why does California dominate technologically to the extent that it does, given that you all seem to think your low taxes and your probusiness environments are so much better? Why aren’t any of these new AI companies located there? Why are they in California and not in Texas, and not in Oklahoma, and not in Florida?\n\nAnd some of that is California. But some of that is things that have been going on there for a long time. So the default is very, very, very strong. But that’s more how I look at that. Like, I think you should, as a liberal, look at how much easier it is to build renewable energy in Texas, and feel ashamed and try to change things. But I don’t think in the long run you will get liberal outcomes through conservative government, and you will not get the reverse. You will not get conservative outcomes through liberal government.\n\nThompson: I’ll pick up where Ezra left off, and then I’ll wind it back to your question, Jerusalem. I think it’s fantastic that Texas builds so much housing. I think it’s fantastic that Texas sites so much solar energy and has so much wind power. That’s a wonderful outcome for Texas and scale to be a wonderful outcome for America. But you know who doesn’t seem to recognize that? Our national libertarians and, more importantly, conservatives, right? Donald Trump could have run on the message, Let’s make America like Texas. Let’s build more solar. Let’s build more wind. Let’s build more housing.\n\nBut instead, despite the fact that he was lofted to power by, I think, in many ways, lots of frustration and furious anger about the state of housing in America, what is his housing agenda? He’s raising tariffs on essential housing materials that come from Canada and Mexico. He’s certainly doing nothing to help the construction industry, which is 25 percent foreign born, meet the demand that is absolutely going to be necessary to catch up with the housing deficit that we’ve built up over the last 20 years.\n\nSo while, yes, I think we should give Texas credit for the fact that its defaults lead, in many cases, to outcomes that liberals would want, it is not at all clear that at the national-politics level, this has trickled up into some kind of positive vision for how to remake America in a way that would help liberal ends. In fact, I think in many ways, it’s the opposite. And it brings us right back to, I think, Ezra’s great first answer to your question.\n\nThe difference between us and libertarians, and certainly the conservatives, is a positive vision of America. And I think it’s cool that this book starts off with, in maybe a little bit of a surprising way, a sci-fi vision of what America in 2050 might look like if we got everything right.\n\nWhat would clean-energy superabundance look like? What would AI look like? What would clean supersonic travel look like, and how would that change people’s lives? How could we eliminate so much of the suffering that’s been the result of chosen scarcities over the last 20 years by fixing it in the next 25?\n\nSo this book, in a very clear way that I don’t think you would see in a lot of conservative manifestos, starts with a very clear vision of a future that I think is unembarrassed about the degree to which its priorities are progressive. But I do think that the processes that progressives have built up over the last 50 years get in the way of making that future buildable.\n\nDemsas: So I absolutely loved the intro that you all wrote. As a sci-fi reader, I just felt completely immersed in that dreamworld. I want to ask you, though, about— there’s a sense in the book that many of the roadblocks to abundance are almost unwitting, right?\n\nLike, you talk about environmental regulations from a past era that were developed to block highways and pipelines, and to clean up the air and water, but are now, unfortunately, blocking solar power and transmission lines and affordable housing. Or that procedural rules—the ones that, you know, Ezra and Derek, you both outlined—are meant to prevent corruption and are, instead, preventing getting contracting done quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut, you know, here’s a place that I struggle because that’s a really, like, friendly story to liberals. It’s a story like, you know, You made a mistake. You know, now it’s time to fix it now that, you know, we’re pointing it out to you. But there are a lot of pieces of evidence that indicate people are not unwitting; they simply disagree. I’m sure you’ve come across this in your reporting, but, you know, there are environmental-justice advocates that have been loud critics of carbon-capture-and-storage technologies, who are fine arguing, to quote, “We simply cannot replace Big Oil with Big Renewable.”\n\nAnother example is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who is actively undermining her most successful affordable-housing program because it was too good at getting housing built, and is layering on a bunch of process onto a very successful affordable-housing program because of complaints that it was actually siting multifamily housing.\n\nSo how much is this a story of liberals just, you know, We have laws and procedures that were well meaning from another era, versus there being a lot of liberals who simply disagree with these goals, even if they’re not willing to say it explicitly?\n\nKlein: I don’t think the story we tell is that it’s just unwitting. I mean, I quote you in the book, Jerusalem, in the housing chapter about the way in which part of the difficulty in building enough housing is that there is an ineradicable tension between making housing a core financial asset and building enough of it—because financial assets, valuable ones, become more valuable in conditions of scarcity. And so there is good reason for people who already live on a block where the housing, you know, is going up and up and up to not want to see that block suddenly get a very large apartment building in it.\n\nNow, there is a kind of alley-oop between the overhang of past legislation, statute, regulation, process, and some of those interests. I don’t think—in fact, I think I tell: I think the story is pretty clear that when California passed the California Environmental Quality Act under [then-Governor Ronald] Reagan—under Reagan—and nobody thought it was a very big deal, and the LA Times didn’t devote a single, sole article to its passage. And then, only later, after a series of court cases, did it apply not just to government projects but to any project requiring government permitting, which is sort of every project, actually, in California.\n\nSo all of a sudden, it becomes a much bigger deal than it was when it passed. And now it becomes a tool to stop housing, not just to do what the legislature initially intended. Well, then that’s different, right? You have a sort of union, then, between a bill that maybe you could not have passed under that argument, but now interests that have learned how to use that bill to follow their current interests.\n\nSo I don’t think—I mean, I would say that if I’ve given anybody the view that I don’t think this is going to be a series of unbelievably bloody fights in liberalism, I apologize. But I don’t actually think that’s the nature of the book. We do try to have a relatively optimistic tone throughout, and we do try to be understanding, because I do believe this to be true—and so does Derek, I think—that much of what was built in past statute-wise, much of what was built in the ’60s and ’70s was built for good reasons. Many of the things we need to unwind today were not villainous constructions. They were thoughtful responses to problems of another era that do not fit our current era.\n\nOne of the lines I like that we have is: Institutional renewal is a task that faces every generation anew. You can’t expect all the institutions and laws and bills and processes from 40 years ago or 50 years ago to fit the moment you’re in. But it’s just, I think, not the case. And I’ve been part of a lot of these fights already that that we’re particularly naive about whether or not people are protecting their interests here. Of course, they are.\n\nThompson: The origin of zoning and the origin of these environmental rules was absolutely inextricably bound up, in many cases, with pure, old-fashioned racism and a kind of selfishness for which neither I nor Ezra have any patience. I mean, Yoni Appelbaum in his book, Stuck, I think very clearly sets out the case that the first zoning laws in California in the 19th century were rather explicitly about finding legal ways to oppress and segregate and ghettoize the Chinese population after the Gold Rush.\n\nI mean, there’s no question that many of these rules have explicitly racist aims—had explicitly racist aims. And when you look at the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s, for all of the objective good that it did—I think you’ve written about the fact—some people used the overhang of environmentalism to essentially just be people against people.\n\nAnd it’s no accident, I think, that Rachel Carson’s book and [Robert] Caro’s book also happened to come out at the same time that [Paul] Ehrlich wrote The Population Bomb. And a lot of environmentalism in the 1960s and 1970s was in cases of fear of and an almost aversion to the idea of masses of people living on this planet. And we have no patience for, certainly, the most racist and hateful aspects of those laws from 60 and 70 years ago.\n\nThat said, I do think that it is true that some liberals today are simply antibusiness in a way that’s I’m not antibusiness. But I also think that it’s important to be fair to the environmental movement that came up in the 1960s and 1970s by pointing out that it was trying to solve problems that, in many cases, we don’t see in the same way today, because those problems were, in many cases, solved.\n\nThe air was disgusting in the 1950s. The rivers were disgusting in the 1950s. The amount of pollution that came out of tailpipes was freaking gross. And we passed a set of rules with the Clean Air [Act] and [Clean] Water Act and all sorts of other laws and regulations that cleaned up the air and cleaned up the water so that every time someone inhales in order to criticize environmentalism today, they are blessed by the fact that the air they inhale is cleaner as a result of the movement that they’re criticizing.\n\nBut to Ezra’s point, institutional renewal is the job of every generation, and we have allowed, I think, in many cases, wise rules that answered problems in the 20th century to become a disease of the 21st century, which is the inability to build in ways that would actually solve those problems, especially when it comes to, you know, rules like NEPA getting in the way of citing and constructing clean-energy technology.\n\nSo I want to be fair to what I took to be the thrust of your question, which is that, yeah, there were a lot of nauseous pieces of this ideology as it came up. But I also want to be fair to the fact that the environmentalist movement had very serious problems to respond to, in many ways solved lots of the problems they intended to solve. But now we’re left with the overhang. We haven’t done institutional renewal in this generation, and it’s time.\n\nDemsas: So both of you have touched on this a little bit in your answers, but the book is pretty explicitly written to liberals. You write, clearly, quote, “We don’t see ourselves as effective messengers to the right.”\n\nI wonder if you can talk a little bit about your decision to make that so clear. I mean, there are a lot of books where you can implicitly tell that it’s written to a specific audience. But, you know, the YIMBY movement, the Yes In My Backyard movement, has been really, really focused on trying to maintain bipartisanship and not cast the housing-abundance element of this as being a problem just for Democrats to focus on. And you, in your book, of course, cite this as well. So why is this book written for the left?\n\nKlein: I think you have to, in any writing project, decide what your problem that you’re trying to solve is. And, you know, Derek and I probably have different versions of this, but for me, some of the genesis of writing this book was simply what has gone wrong in California. California’s my state. I love it. And in California, every statewide elected official is a Democrat.\n\nYou had to sort of—my first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics. But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there? You know, like, It’s going great. So that’s one dimension. I mean, there’s actually just a question for me I was trying to answer.\n\nAlthough, I will say, then, to the other side of it, I think that people on the right are going to get a lot out of this book. And I think in some ways, the decision to focus this as a kind of conversation among different flavors of people on the left will make it a little bit easier for them to hear it. Now, it’s going to come into this context of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and J. D. Vance and Russell Vought trying to destroy the federal government. So the right’s got its own sort of questions it’s going to need to figure out.\n\nBut in terms of state-level issues, in terms of, you know, affordable housing, I think there’s a funny dynamic right now around YIMBYism particularly, where, look—the YIMBYs, they want to be bipartisan, but they arose in California, right? That has always been, in its initial incarnation, a movement that is different flavors of Democrats talking to each other. But they have had a bigger effect, I think, in some ways, on red states than on blue ones, because as much as their intellectual victory has happened among liberals of different sorts—you heard, you know, Kamala Harris promising 3 million new homes and Barack Obama talking about the DNC—like, as we both know, as we all know, there’s not a housing-supply increase in San Francisco, where YIMBYism really begins. There’s not a housing-supply increase in California.\n\nLike, I was just looking at FRED data for private housing starts over the past 10 years, and it is lower in January 2025 than it was in January of 2015. On the other hand, Montana has put forward great YIMBY policies, right? Florida and Miami, in particular, have done some really, really good things. And I don’t want to take away. Like, there was a good upzoning in Gowanus, in New York City. The “City of Yes” policies in New York, I think, are promising.\n\nBut I do think sometimes other coalitions can look without having to activate all their internal defenses at a fight happening on the other side and think, Okay, what can we learn from that? So I think our hope is to have constructive conversations with people on the right, as well. But specifically because a lot of this book is about achieving liberal goals, it just, I think, didn’t make sense to try to say that the problems were going to be the same everywhere, because a lot of the things that the right is doing that I don’t like, they’re doing it because they want a world I don’t want. And telling them they’re wrong to be doing it then doesn’t make a ton of sense.\n\nThompson: Certainly, a good excuse for us is that a book about how the left needs to get better at focusing is a book that explicitly focuses on its audience and says in the opening chapter, here’s who we’re writing this book for. Because if you’re writing a book about what went wrong in America over the last 50 years, there is maybe an infinitude of stories that you could tell, an infinitude of audiences you want to tell those stories to. But I like the fact that we say, This is a book about how we want liberalism to change. And telling liberals to not be conservatives is essentially telling them to not do the thing they’ve already decided they definitely don’t want to do.\n\nSo that’s a way in which I think the focus of this book, even though you’re absolutely right that it says from the start, Look: There are conservatives who are doing their own thing. We wish them well—I think that’s the line explicitly—this is a book about how we want liberalism to change in America, because we have a vision of America that we believe to be in keeping with liberal outcomes and liberal priorities.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: After the break: Is localism standing in the way of abundance?\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: So I definitely want to come back to the electoral side of this, but before then, because you both are trapped on my podcast, I’m going to ask you about my work, which has been really focused on decentralization and localism. And this is a thing that I think you know: I loved your book. I think it’s great. I think everyone should buy it. We will put links to everything you are saying at the—\n\nKlein: You gotta say that at the top, Jerusalem. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: It’ll be in the intro. Don’t worry. (Laughs.)\n\nKlein: You can’t hope people are going to make it all the way here. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: Yeah. People aren’t going to make it to even minute 30 of this podcast.\n\nSo, you know, I think the thing that’s missing in your book, for me, was a discussion of decentralization and localism, because something I have become pretty strongly convinced of is that even when you have alignment of a lot of these interests towards abundance, towards growth, the thing that becomes difficult is: It’s really, really hard to do anything if you have to get a thousand people on board.\n\nAnd so you get the situation where, you know, someone who I was talking to who works really strongly in transportation told me that he’d had a conversation with a Swedish transportation planner who was shocked to realize that when a project got a right of way, when it got permission to use an area of road from one part of the government, it did not mean that it didn’t have to go to multiple other levels of government to get that. Like, he just could not believe that’s how we did things here.\n\nAnd so to me, I think that this is a core problem of abundance that abundance has to deal with. And I think it’s one of the hardest parts because there’s a way to get people animated about housing. There’s a way to get people animated about energy. I mean, these are core things that people think about in their lives. But trying to get people on board with a vision of how you streamline government, in a very boring way—putting together offices, making sure there are fewer local governments in consolidation—like, this is not a popular thing, and it’s not a thing that people are willing to focus on. So is the fact that it’s left out an indication that you don’t view this as a core part of the goals of abundance? Or what’s going on here?\n\nThompson: Jerusalem, you know the dynamics of localism better than I do, but I’ve done a bit of reporting on opposition to housing and the [Research] Triangle area, in North Carolina. And the layers here are very interesting because you have NIMBY residents who understand the machinery of opposition. So if there’s a new development that’s up for a vote, these folks know where to show up. They know what council meetings to make statements at. They know how to pitch those statements directly to the council.\n\nAnd then in many cases, the council members are, in some cases, antibuild activists who ran for office and pride themselves in standing up against developers. And so it’s not just about changing minds in the public; it’s also about the phenomenon of these meetings. And it’s about the people who sit on the councils.\n\nAnd I’ve asked people down here in government, What would change this? What would change this dynamic and make it easier to build housing? And some of it they said is just, You need new people in the city council who are going to vote for housing rather than associate good governance with the ability to always discover reasons to oppose new developments, right? Some of it is just a matter of personnel in the city council.\n\nSome of it, they said, is a matter of retail politics and persuasion. It’s a matter of making the case when you’re talking to folks that you’re the mayor or you’re the city council because your priority is to expand housing development no matter what. And you’re going to repeat that priority at every city council meeting over and over and over, and it’s going to be your north star. And you’re not going to allow other process-oriented priorities to eclipse it.\n\nBut sometimes it’s just a matter of political courage. It’s a mayor or a city council member standing up in one of these city council meetings where the audience is, you know, 80–20 against new development and pointing out a fact that I believe you, Jerusalem, have told me many times, which is that: For every one person in this room who has the time and energy and resources to appear here, there are 10 people not in this room who will be helped by housing abundance. And so what we are seeing, what we are seeing in this room in the city council meeting, is a meeting that is oriented around caring for the people who get up in front of the microphone. But being in government means caring about the people who don’t have time to come here and step up to the mic.\n\nAnd I think that kind of political courage is akin to—not equivalent to, but akin to—what we saw in Pennsylvania with [Governor Josh] Shapiro and [PennDOT Secretary Mike] Carroll essentially saying, Look—we’ve got a bridge that fell down in I-95, and we can go through the regular processes, and it can take—What?—12, 24 months to rebuild this bridge. We can have, you know, procurement rules, and we can have bidding rules, and we can have environmental review that goes on and on, and we can have permitting. But fundamentally, we need to put this thing up in two weeks. And so that’s what they did. They put it up in two weeks. They said, No environmental reviews. We’re going to get this contractor over here, and this contractor over here to build the damn thing as soon as possible. And they built the damn thing as soon as possible. It took 12 days and not 12 months.\n\nSo I do think that a lot of this comes down to political courage, and it’s going to take political courage to do what you are talking about, to take a culture of federalized localism and say, You know what? I think we might be better off if we limit the number of opportunities that people who oppose development in this city have to block every single thing that happens. And I’m just going to go on the road and say over and over again: I’m not doing this to limit citizen voice. In a way, I’m doing it to raise citizen voice, because I care more about the voices of the people who are not complaining on the mic every two months. I care about those voices more than I care about the people who happen to have time to go up in front of the microphone.\n\nThat’s a hard thing to say, and I cannot guarantee that it’s politically popular enough to win election after election. But I do think that fundamentally what you’re asking for is not just a procedural, not just a sort of a governance, organizational change. It’s a matter of personality. It’s a matter of courage as well.\n\nKlein: I think that’s right. I really want to pick up on that idea that it’s a matter of personality. One of the core theses of the book—I’m not sure how explicitly we say it outside of the Mancur Olson section—is that modern liberalism is overly process focused, that it has repeatedly substituted process for outcome. And that takes different shapes in different places.\n\nSo when you’re dealing with things that require local approval, like housing, you often have that as the problem of decentralization, right? The power is split, fractured—these meetings that have very, very unrepresentative samples of the population showing up. But when you’re dealing with other areas, right? Like, I spent a bunch of time on the CHIPS and Science Act in the book, and the Notice of Funding Opportunity and all of the everything-bagel provisions and added standards and goals that got put into there.\n\nAnd that wasn’t localism. That wasn’t even decentralization. That was done centrally at the Commerce Department. And I report on that, and I know a bunch of the people involved. That was just coming out of a culture in liberalism, of personalities, as Derek put it a second ago, that just kind of doesn’t want to say no to anybody, that wants everybody in the coalition to be as happy as possible.\n\nSo I think that the view that I at least came to, ultimately—I don’t want to speak for Derek here—is that this is all manifestations of something similar that we don’t have, like, a really good way to talk about. But it’s closer to the temperament of a coalition. If the temperament of the MAGA coalition right now is autocratic, the temperament of the liberal coalition is bureaucratic. And in becoming bureaucratic, it shapes itself differently at different levels of government. But sort of at all of them, somebody needs to be in the meeting who can say, Enough. Thank you, everybody, for your opinions. We are going to do this. Sometimes that is a question of power. Sometimes that is a question of leadership. Sometimes you don’t have the ability to do that, and we need to restructure the way, in theory, at least, that the overlapping, jurisdictional issues are handled.\n\nThat’s very, very hard to do, and I think you should be very pessimistic about good outcomes if that’s your only approach that will work. And sometimes it’s that somebody needs to just say it and, like, be willing to take the political pain for saying it. I sort of think this is somehow connected to educational polarization in the parties—this is not in the book, because I can’t prove it—\n\nDemsas: (Laughs.) That’s what podcasts are for.\n\nKlein: Right? I think this is connected in a way that educational polarization in the parties, in the way that the Democratic Party has aligned to become the prosystem party, and the Republican Party is aligned more to become the antisystem party. And you just have a relationship to systems and processes and bureaucracies that are different on the two sides.\n\nAnd there are huge pathologies in the Republican approach to this. It is not good that nobody can tell Donald Trump no. It is not good that they don’t listen to anybody else, that they don’t give a shit what any of the Republicans in Congress think. It is not good that if you tell Elon Musk he’s believing conspiracy theories, he will tell you to fuck off, and fire you from his company or throw you out of the meeting, right?\n\nI actually have this whole view—and, again, not in the book, but we’re in Podcast Land here—that the temperaments of the two coalitions have polarized into very unhealthy personality types. Basically, the coalitions need an ecosystem of different personalities in them: some who are more authoritarian, like, a little bit, right? Some who are much more process oriented. It was good for the Democratic coalition that it had its antisystem hippies inside of it. Now that, you know, as Matt Yglesias puts it, the crank realignment has put RFK Jr. and all those people in the Republican Party, they’re too crankish. And, in a way, the Democratic Party is insufficiently skeptical of big corporations and big systems.\n\nSo there’s something here that I think is really important. It’s very hard to prove, but I do think it’s temperamental. And it sometimes comes out, as you were saying, in too much localism, but not only in that. If it were only in that, then we would just have a big chapter on how localism is a problem. But because we see it rhyming across so many places often where localism has nothing to do with it, I think it’s something broader.\n\nDemsas: One of the things that I love about your book is how much you focus on abundance as, like, a vibe shift and not just a laundry list of policy changes, but that there needs to be a serious reorientation in how people think about themselves, their roles, what liberalism is for. I mean, you analogize it to how environmentalism was this lens that gave everyone a different way of viewing government and industry and the goals of liberalism. And, you know, abundance is hopefully another lens that people can use and apply.\n\nBut both of you have brought up Trump and Musk a bunch of times in this conversation, and I imagine someone coming to this conversation fresh—coming to your book fresh, and hasn’t been deeply involved in the debates that we all have been for the past several years in the abundance space—might be confused as to why this book is coming out now, hitting liberals for undermining government. And, of course, publishing timelines are what they are.\n\nBut Ben Wallace-Wells wrote a review of your book, and books of friends of the show Yoni Appelbaum and Marc Dunkelman, for The New Yorker. And he made the following comment that I hope you guys can respond to: “The abundance advocates emphasize the problem of ideology, because of who usually wrote the rules, but what’s happening is also, more simply, about wealth and power. When it comes to the expense of New York’s subways, the latest studies identify some specific culprits: the city builds many more mezzanine levels in its stations than is the case in stations overseas, and it hires more consultants. How much of that is really about liberalism?”\n\nHe goes on to say that it is “flatly ahistorical” to blame liberals for lack of progress on climate change. So I guess the question that has been posed to me multiple times as well is: Are we all just engaged in a long line of liberal self-flagellation and are ignoring the elephant in the room that is the Republican and Trump-Musk administration? Or is Ben wrong?\n\nKlein: I think Ben is wrong. (Laughs.)\n\nLook: I wrote a whole book about how much you can’t get done at the national level because of Republicans. So I sort of take a back seat to nobody on that, and that’s a huge amount of my coverage. But does Ben think California is well governed? Does Ben think New York is well governed? Does Ben think Illinois is well governed? Does Ben think these places where Republicans hold zero power are losing people by coincidence?\n\nAt some point, you have to be able to say, It’s not the only thing happening in the world that the other side is bad. Now, it’s awkward to bring out this book—I mean, in some ways, it’s helpful; in some ways, it’s awkward—to bring it, you know, during the Elon Musk–Donald Trump–DOGE era. Although, I do think that it gives us a kind of way to talk about: If you don’t make government work—really make it work—if you do not actually truly care that people can feel it in their lives, that you don’t have these debacles, like $42 billion for broadband that doesn’t give anybody broadband access, then you’re going to open the door for right-wing populists to come in and burn it down.\n\nBut I think that there is—sometimes I’m reading reviews. I’m actually pretty comfortable with bad reviews. I’ve been in this game for a very long time. And—\n\nDemsas: I don’t think it’s even a bad review.\n\nKlein: Ben’s wasn’t a bad review. That’s not what I’m saying. Ben’s was actually a very good piece.\n\nBut the thing I was going to say is that sometimes in reviews, you can tell when you have tripped people’s preference for affect, right? They just, like, want more Republican bashing in the thing, right? They want what Tyler Cowen would call more “mood affiliation.” And I just think we actually need less of it. And I think one way you develop credibility as a political tendency is you admit where you’ve gone wrong.\n\nYes, it is the case that it is substantially due to Republican opposition at the national level that we have not been able to pass more on climate. On the other hand, it is not the case that Republican opposition is why, after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, Democrats never did permitting reform to make sure that the money it is spending could build enough of the green infrastructure it intends to build at the speed that we need to build it.\n\nRepublicans actually were willing to work with Democrats on that. It was Democrats who did not want to go forward there. Now, the Biden administration sort of hid behind Joe Manchin and supported Joe Manchin’s permitting bills, but liberals hated Manchin. And by the way, Joe Manchin’s permitting reform is not what I would’ve done.\n\nSo I think you just gotta be really careful. There are, I think, very good critiques of this. But why, you know, we have to spend more time blaming Republicans for our own failures I actually just don’t think is one of them, and I think it’s a kind of intellectual-failure mode in politics.\n\nI think we’ve got to spend a lot of time blaming Republicans for Republican failures, and they’re currently attempting an autocratic breakthrough at the top of the U.S. government. And, like, obviously, I cover that day in and day out, but I think liberals don’t take their own failures nearly seriously enough. And the real problem with that, in addition to that then we can’t fix them, is also: Voters notice. And voters don’t trust you.\n\nGavin Newsom wants to run for president with the burning desire of a thousand suns. Right? He wants it so bad. And Gavin Newsom has every right to run for president. The guy’s governor of California. He’s going to have a huge problem running for president, because people don’t think California’s well governed. And it’s not even that he hasn’t been trying to change a bunch of that. I think a lot of what Gavin Newsom has been trying to do is good, but the fact of the matter is: Housing is a disaster. Homelessness is a disaster. They haven’t built high-speed rail. And none of it has been solved.\n\nSo that’s another issue. You begin destroying total generations, really, of political talent because they’re coming out of a place where they can’t defend what they’ve done. Like, does anybody want Kathy Hochul to run for president? When people don’t think the places you run are working, it doesn’t then work to say, Trust us.\n\nAnd so I just don’t think you can—like, it is true that part of why various decarbonization actions have not worked is due to Republican opposition and obstruction. And again, that’s all mentioned in the book. But it’s just also true that we haven’t done a good enough job. And that’s part of the reason Texas and Georgia and a bunch of red places are building more out of the IRA than liberal states. The places where liberal states are getting more IRA money is in the credits to buy things that are built elsewhere.\n\nThompson: Yeah. To the extent that Ezra and I disagree about anything, certainly no disagreements have been revealed in the last 55 minutes. Because I want to echo and amen with hands over my head everything that he just said, and also, ladle some extra defensiveness on top of it.\n\nYou know, to the extent that Ben thinks it is flatly historical that liberals are the principal enemies of climate change, I just want to be very clear: All four of us—me, Ezra, Jerusalem, Ben—all know that this is in the book and that we all agree about this. I mean, we say in the first chapter that it’s no point talking to Republicans about climate-change goals if so many Republicans don’t even believe in or prioritize climate change.\n\nAnd then as we talk about in the penultimate chapter, the U.S.—I don’t think this is well understood—in the 1970s was, in many ways, the world leader on solar energy. And we basically gutted our energy R&D and our solar industry because Ronald Reagan comes into office and puts a dentist in as the head of the Department of Energy and takes the solar panels off the roof of the White House. And basically, we decide for the next 30 years that we’re not going to do anything about the development of solar energy.\n\nSo that is in the book, and it is absolutely the case that if both parties agreed with the fervor of the Democrats that climate change was a problem, we’d be in a very different state in terms of the amount of zero-carbon energy that we produce in this country. That’s No. 1.\n\nNo. 2: I think the most important part of Ezra’s message right there is that liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism. And if it isn’t, then we’ll lose. One of the best lines in the book, and this was Ezra’s addition, is that Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.\n\nWe don’t want to give them this ammunition, because it’s incredibly effective to say that the places that liberals run are, unfortunately, not run well. And finally, on the issue of, say, the Second Avenue subway, you know, I was talking to Sam Bowman for an article in The Atlantic about the degree to which the U.K. could use an abundance agenda. And he made a really interesting point, because if there’s any country that has a worse problem of building than America, it’s clearly the U.K., which has basically been on a downward slope since, you know, something like the Victorian era when it came to building things in that country.\n\nAnd I said, you know, Why does Spain and Portugal—why do these countries, which don’t rival Britain in terms of wealth—seem to do so much better on building things? And he said, In Spain in particular, you’ve had coalitions in government that run on their ability to build quickly and effectively. And I was like, Jesus Christ. What a concept. I mean, imagine a mayor of New York running on New York accelerating the degree to which it’s building the Second Avenue subway at a cost that isn’t $2 billion per square mile. Imagine someone being able to run for governor of New York for, say, another term by saying, Look at our progress in high-speed rail, and look at our progress with homelessness.\n\nThis idea of people running for government by pointing to their achievements at making government work, that’s unbelievable to me. And that’s what we should aim for. We should aim for liberals being able to run by saying, Look at how I made liberalism work where liberalism had power. And right now, I don’t think that there are enough places that can do that. And as a result, I think it’s hard for liberalism to build power without those advertisements.\n\nDemsas: You guys are making a couple of electoral arguments, both in the book and implicitly in what you’ve been saying here. One is that, you know, the specific messaging-argument problem, which is just, like, If you can’t point to the thing that you’ve done and say it’s good, then why would people vote for you? But then you also are kind of drawing out some math problems for Democrats when it comes to population loss in blue states making it harder for Democrats to win the electoral college, reducing congressional representation in the House.\n\nBut I think the thing that struck me as the most important are the arguments you make about how scarcity fuels illiberalism. Can you draw out those arguments for me?\n\nKlein: I love it. Well, we do quote you in those arguments. Do you want to draw those arguments? (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: That’s why they’re so good. (Laughs.)\n\nThompson: What’s your favorite passage of a Jerusalem Demsas article? And just read it slowly and mellifluously.\n\nDemsas: Sure. Let’s do that.\n\nKlein: Yeah, there’s a lot of Jerusalem Demsas in the book. I think you had the best piece on this, so I’m going to do the weird podcaster thing and be like, How do you think scarcity draws out of liberalism?\n\nDemsas: Well, first of all, you guys are very generous citers. Anyone who is interested in reading more, it’s very easy. There’s, like, a hundred pages of notes and acknowledgements in here. But I think on this question of illiberalism, this is something that got into my head, particularly, when it came to Trump and Vance’s campaigning against immigration. And of course, I’m not making the claim that there are no legitimate concerns about immigration. We’ll park that for a second.\n\nWhat we saw was clearly a weaponization of scarcity, and the problem of scarcity incites one of two possible responses, right? Either it’s: There’s not enough. I have to defend my own. I have to, you know, eventually make sure that other people can’t take housing that could go to my child, or this really good job might go to an immigrant or to a person of color, or to a woman and not to me or my family member or friend. And that’s, like, one very natural response to scarcity.\n\nAnd the other is liberalism. It’s the promise that you can make more, that there can be enough housing for everyone who needs it, that there can be, you know, enough good-quality jobs that new people coming into your community isn’t a threat to your way of life. It’s actually making your life better. But the problem is that that has to actually be true, right? And as you talk about in these blue states, I mean, there is a problem where they have made housing scarce That has created a serious problem. And, I mean, we saw that in Springfield, Ohio, as a very effective cudgel for Trump and Vance to wield.\n\nAnd so to me, abundance is a necessary prerequisite for liberalism at large. If you want people to feel open to expanding rights to people who are different from them, to be open to new things happening, to change immigration, whatever it is, they have to feel like there’s an abundance of opportunity. You’re never going to look at a choice between an immigrant and your child in the housing market and decide to go with the immigrant, you know what I mean?\n\nSo the thing I want to get from you two is, like: I worry that many people are taking a policy critique, something about the goals that we might have with decarbonization, with abundant housing, with a bunch of other things and trying to make it into an electoral argument. Because right now, in particular, the Democratic Party is searching for a way towards relevancy, and there’s room to make an argument to that set of policy makers.\n\nSo do you think that we are—and I mean me, in particular, that I’m—overstating the importance of abundance from an electoral standpoint? Like, how much of it is important, given that we’re in this populist moment, you know, that’s very anticentralization, very opposed to government, lots of people excited by the so-called DOGE efficiency move? So how much of this is just wish casting that we’re doing? And is it really relevant to Democrats’ electoral outcomes that they’re focused on abundance?\n\nKlein: Well, let me say a few things. One is that we’re definitely not in a moment that is anticentralization, because we’ve never seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power. Not never, but in the modern era, we haven’t seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power and actively centralizing power as Donald Trump. And certainly his, you know, quote-unquote populist right is loving that, which, to be fair, is how the populous right usually is. It’s a highly centralized, you know, The people will have their voice through the leader who authentically represents the will of the people and wields power without check, balance, or oversight.\n\nSo it’s always kind of a contradictory mess. But that’s, I think, the moment we’re in. And I do think it does exist a little bit as a response to highly bureaucratized liberalism, although that’s not the only thing, obviously, it’s responding to.\n\nOne of the things I was thinking about when you were saying that, Jerusalem, was Elon Musk and the way in which, I mean, it’s like we’re in Dark Elon Musk territory, very much so. Because you can imagine this other Elon Musk, right? Elon Musk as a political figure, you know, from 2012, 2014 who is proabundance, because Elon Musk’s career is, like, an amazing set of proof points for at least part of what, you know, Derek and I want to see in the world.\n\nHere you have an immigrant who came to America. He then set up, first, a series of businesses in the lightly regulated digital sector. But then he began moving into the highly regulated automobile and go-to-space sectors, and solar, for that matter. And then he built these companies on the back of government subsidies, government loan guarantees, and government contracts, becoming the single-best example—living example—for what public-private partnerships can accomplish.\n\nLike, you can really imagine Elon Musk as this unbelievable messenger of abundance and trying to make possible more of the kind of thing he did for more companies, more people. Instead, he’s trying to pull up the ladders behind him and get more contracts and, you know. And I think a lot of what he’s doing is ideologically motivated as he’s fallen down darker and darker right-wing rabbit holes on the platform he bought to derange himself.\n\nBut there’s something else there that could have happened. And it points to—and this is the thing I say that I do think is an addition to some of the stuff you’ve written in that New York Times essay—where the core of the populous right’s politics has to be scarcity. It just has to be. Because its first commitment is fewer immigrants. Its first commitment is that trade is a zero-sum game where there’s always a winner or a loser. Abundance is fundamentally positive sum, and the populist right is fundamentally negative sum, or at least zero-sum. There is nothing more fundamental to the way Donald Trump views the world than the things that are zero-sum negotiations. All of them. There’s always a winner and loser.\n\nAnd it’s just not how we see it. So he has to choose the pathway he’s choosing, because that is the dark engine of his politics, both here and in other countries. He didn’t invent this. This is something we’ve seen in many places, at many times. So electorally, then, I think you get into a couple questions. And look—there are a lot of electoral pathways that might work. And I don’t run in elections and win a lot of elections, but I’ve covered politics for a long time.\n\nOne thing that I do believe is just true is that you tend to win when you represent the future and not the past. And I think a really dangerous thing electorally for Democrats is that Donald Trump’s meaning has fundamentally changed since 2016. In 2016, he represented a kind of past against Hillary Clinton representing a different kind of past. And now he represents a future because Musk and RFK Jr. and Vance and Marc Andreessen—all of them together, the sort of flooding in of Rogan World—it has changed the meaning of Donald Trump from a defense of what there was to an idea about what’s coming.\n\nAnd I think they’re going to fuck that up, because they’re breaking things they don’t understand. You know, and if we don’t fall into autocracy, I think the backlash to the tariffs and everything else is going to be really profound. I could be wrong, obviously. But I think it is fundamental that Democrats are going to need to, if they’re going to be a successful political party, recapture a vision of the future.\n\nI mean, it’s a reason why in our book we put invention so at the core of things, right? We start with that slightly sci-fi vignette because we are trying to get people to imagine a future. This is about what world you are trying to build. And I think that is potent in American politics. I think that in politics, you need to have—to be as successful as you often want to be—a new vision.\n\nI think that you need to reorient politics around a divide that is healthier for you. Polarization is—the next question should always be, Well, what are we polarized over? Right? And is the nature of that cleavage good for us or bad for us? And I think one of the real cleavages right now is abundance and scarcity. And I think people have, like, underplayed this. They’ve wanted to say it’s sort of a moral regressiveness or an anti-institutionalism, right? Like, those are the things Donald Trump represents to liberals. He’s like a racist who hates the fundamental institutions of modern life. And that’s true in many ways. But it’s clearly not enough.\n\nAnd I think as Democrats begin to lose the future and lose the sense that they have a vision of what should be coming, that has become a really profound weakness. So what I’m looking for is, like, not just candidates who can sort of manage the politics-of-evasion problem and accept where Democrats get out of step with people, but candidates who can see some other way of organizing American politics, some other set of conflicts that are better for them and more constructive for the country than what we’ve had. And I think that, like, at a vibes level is what we are trying to offer. Like, a different way of cutting what this is all really about.\n\nThompson: Yeah. One way we sometimes talked about it is that American politics tends to be built on axes: Are you liberal or are you conservative? Are you proimmigrant or are you anti? Are you pro-DEI or are you anti? And we’re trying to introduce a new binary, a new axis here, which is abundance versus scarcity. And the reason why we’re trying to introduce this axis is not just because we think that axis is important, and it’s not just because we think that axis is illuminating to understand American policy and American economics. It’s also an axis on which liberals can win.\n\nWe’ve seen, I think, in the last few months that scarcity doesn’t just empower illiberal movements, as Jerusalem, that was the basis of your question. It’s also the case that scarcity empowers illiberal movements to pursue scarcity. I mean, look at what the Trump administration has done in the first few weeks. By saying, America can’t afford our debt—scarcity—we therefore cannot afford healthcare for the poor. More scarcity. Because America doesn’t have a healthy economy—scarcity—we have to accept American hardship—more deprivation. Because we don’t have enough manufacturing, we have to suffer the consequences of tariffs—scarcity for scarcity. Because we don’t have enough housing, we therefore need fewer immigrants. Oh, we don’t have enough of this, therefore we need less of that which we need. I mean, this is an argument of scarcity requiring scarcity, and it is an argument that we should be, as liberals, excited to take on, right?\n\nEvery administration invariably creates the conditions for its own opposition. Every single administration does this. That is the basis of thermostatic politics in America, and it’s the basis of thermostatic politics around the world. I think that liberals need both a negative identity and a positive identity. And this is my gloss, my wrapping paper on what Ezra just said: You need a negative identity, which is what you’re against, and you need a positive identity, which is what you’re for.\n\nIt’s obvious what the Democratic Party is against. Open any newspaper any day of the week: That’s what we’re against, right? Donald Trump is taking a wrecking ball to politics. Elon Musk is tweeting nonsense after nonsense on social media, while, at the same time, pretending he understands things that he’s absolutely demolishing. That, I think, goes catastrophically against American interests. The negative identity of the Democratic Party is incredibly clear. That is the unfortunate toxic gift of Donald Trump in power.\n\nBut what’s the positive identity? What are we actually for, beyond just being against Donald Trump? That’s where I think we need to offer a positive-sum vision, right? And that vision is what we call abundance. And it’s why, again, I think it’s really cool to have a book that is predominantly, in so many ways, a self-critique of the body of liberalism in America. But it begins with a sci-fi positive vision. Here’s what we’re aiming for. Here is our north star. This is what we want to build. Let’s see if we can get out of our way and build it.\n\nAnd of course, that requires winning elections against a movement that right now is dominated by Donald Trump. But I don’t think we need further clarification on how to be anti-Trump. I think we need further clarification on how to stand for something bigger than being anti-Trump.\n\nDemsas: So one thing I wanted to ask about—and I mean this: A big part of your book is about invention and about scientific innovation. We haven’t talked a lot about that. But one thing I think I wanted to ask about it is that it feels, in many ways, that the barriers hampering housing, transit, energy are different than the ones standing in the way of scientific innovation.\n\nI mean, in housing, we know how to build a house. Transit: We see high-speed rail. We see energy. We know how to build solar panels. These are things that other countries are building. Of course, there’s innovation that can happen in all of these spaces, and I appreciate all of the focus on productivity that you have in the book. But are the problems preventing scientific innovation—are those really in the same wheelhouse as these other baskets that you guys are focusing on?\n\nThompson: Some of them absolutely are, and some of them absolutely are not. You know, in one way, you can think about abundance as being a kind of three-part process. Part one is: You decide what the good is that you’re aiming for. What’s the positive vision?\n\nPart two is: You have to actually understand the market, the industry that is responsible for producing that vision. You have to understand local housing markets to figure out what’s wrong with housing. You have to understand clean-energy technology and siting rules in order to figure out how to build more clean energy. And in science and technology, you have to understand science markets and how scientific funding works and how the discovery process works.\n\nAnd then part three is: You remove the bottlenecks that are in the way. And sometimes that means taking things away, and sometimes it means adding things. So in the world of science, right, what we want are more lifesaving medical breakthroughs that add the most important thing in the world, which is more healthy years of life. And the difficult thing about science is that you don’t exactly know what you are aiming for specifically, because unlike building a house or unlike siting a solar farm, discoveries are, by their very nature, unknown before you discover them.\n\nSo what I did for this piece is try to figure out, Okay, what are the inputs to scientific breakthroughs? It’s smart people, it’s time, and it’s money. The problem that we identified with the National Institutes of Health is that we have created, over the last 60 years, a set of bureaucratic procedures and paperwork requirements. This created a situation where the typical scientist now spends his or her time filling out paperwork or filing grants and not doing actual science.\n\nI consider that to be an absolute catastrophe, and so do many scientists. And you can reframe the catastrophe this way: Imagine if we discovered one day in the near future that typical American scientists suffered from a virus that created a chronic-fatigue disorder that knocked out 40 percent of their working years, such that they had to sleep, say, between January and late May of every single year. We’d say, Well, obviously, this is an enormous crisis for American science. But in many cases, this is not an exogenous bacteria or virus. These are requirements in paperwork laws that we have created for ourselves and for our scientists.\n\nSo first, I want to find ways of experimenting with funding that reduces the paperwork requirements in ways that I see very similar as the benefits of reducing bureaucratic and paperwork requirements in, say, affordable-housing construction or broadband-internet construction with the Infrastructure Act under President Biden.\n\nSo there are some things that I think we want to take away and reform and streamline in ways that are totally similar to many earlier parts of the book. But also, I’m not a pure libertarian on this standpoint. I don’t think that the road to scientific abundance flows purely through just taking things away.\n\nI also think we need to create new programs and recognize, for example, the absolute wonder that Operation Warp Speed did. I mean, Operation Warp Speed truly is one of the most remarkable programs in modern American history because it was fantastically successful at producing a life-saving medical therapy, and also, in a weird way, has been abandoned by both the Democratic and Republican Parties.\n\nDemocrats don’t talk about it, because it’s a Trump initiative, and Republicans, I think, don’t talk about it because, in many cases, they’re an anti-vax movement. And so it’s been orphaned, but the lessons of Operation Warp Speed—the way it created incentives for scientists, the way it removes roadblocks for actually building therapies that you invent—I think are incredibly important if we want to create science that saves people’s lives and build that science into products that extends people’s lives.\n\nSo the way I see it, the message in science intervention is absolutely in keeping with the thrust of abundance. It depends on a positive vision. It depends on a very keen understanding of the market that’s relevant to making that vision a reality. And then it looks very clearly at: What are the bottlenecks to take away and what are the policies to add?\n\nDemsas: This talking about innovation and the failures inherent in the scientific process feels like a great time to ask our last and final question. Derek, let’s start with you. What is something that you originally thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nThompson: When Laura and I had our first kid, we were getting a lot of advice from people about the need to put the baby first and the fact that, of course, when you have a baby, the baby is what suddenly must come first. And that sounded fantastic. It’s certainly something close to the cliché of what new parents are told, that something has been introduced to their life around which they have to reorient their life. And that’s absolutely true in so many ways.\n\nBut the truth is, the best advice that I got about being a parent was the exact opposite. I was talking to a friend, Brian, who said, I think my favorite parenting advice is, No. 1: Look out for yourself. No. 2: Look out for the relationship with your partner. And then No. 3: Look out for your child. If you’re not your best self, he won’t be the best possible partner. And if you’re not the best possible partnership, you won’t be good parents.\n\nSo in a weird way, the child comes last. And there’s something beautifully counterintuitive and lovely about that, about the need for and the benefit of a kind of wise selfishness in parenting. And I love that that goes slightly against the good-on-paper advice of when you have a baby, that new baby needs to be the pure and unassailable sun around which your solar system must orbit.\n\nDemsas: We get a lot of parenting responses in Good on Paper. Ezra, what’s yours?\n\nKlein: Ooh, I mean, I think before Derek gave that answer, I was going to give a very book-related answer about something about regulations or—not all regulations, but, you know, there’s certain categories of regulations and comment structures that I took just as generally good before that I don’t now.\n\nBut I’ll give a more personal one, so I don’t seem like a robot: Getting less sleep. For a lot of my life and definitely a lot of my career, my 20s as a journalist and early 30s maybe, probably particularly before I had kids, I was a very much, like, a sleep-is-a-cousin-of-death kind of person. And I would try to set the alarm earlier and earlier, and would just push through, and sort of felt that every hour I was spending asleep was an hour I wasn’t spending alive.\n\nAnd I really just now understand that to be the opposite. I had this one moment at some point where I thought I had been just kind of anxious for years, and maybe I was just tired. Like, maybe I just mixed up the two feelings, or the two feelings were just feeding into each other, certainly. And so now, I do not always succeed, because I have kids and a job and all the rest of it, but I really would like to get as much sleep as I possibly can as opposed to as little sleep as I can possibly get away with. And that has been a pretty big conceptual change.\n\n[Music]\n\nThompson: I would warn listeners: Don’t take these pieces of advice in the opposite order. Don’t try to sleepmax and then have a baby. That will lead to a little bit of priority confusion. Nonetheless, I do think that when you do have a kid, being protective of sleep is unbelievably important for all of the obvious reasons.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you both for coming on the show. I’m so excited that this book is in the world. I’m so excited to continue this conversation with the both of you.\n\nKlein: Thank you, and for all your work here, which is hugely informative to what we ended up doing. Really, really appreciate it.\n\nThompson: Yeah. Thanks for being an inspiration.\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Rosie Hughes.

        "title": "The Kennedy Center Performers Who Didn’t Cancel",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "After Donald Trump announced the appointment of a new chair—himself—at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, many artists rushed to cancel their scheduled appearances. As the cancellations rolled in, the remaking of the Kennedy Center as a Trumpist cultural mecca seemed imminent.\n\nBut more quietly, most scheduled performers have not canceled. In the first month of Trump’s chairmanship, the Center hosted a children’s play based on the Navajo creation myth; a class on Caribbean-carnival dancing that teaches, “Every Body is a Carnival Body”; a Klezmer band that plays Yiddish labor music; an Afro-Cuban jazz singer who performs in Spanish; a Black jazz singer who performed a song in the South African click language of Xhosa; a Black low-country Gullah band; and an “oratorio on the fight for women’s suffrage,” as one glowing review in The Washington Post called it.\n\nRead: Trump takes over the Kennedy Center\n\nMany of the artists who went through with their appearance agonized over whether to perform. They faced a version of the dilemma that many people in government, business, and civil society have confronted under the first and second Trump presidencies: When does quitting count as resistance, and when is it surrender? Like the cancelers, those who stuck it out feared that the Kennedy Center would be stripped of its character and turned into an organ for Trump. The difference is they came to believe that canceling would only bring that scenario closer to reality.\n\nThe immediate future of the Kennedy Center is unclear, but no sweeping changes have been made to its programming. The institution’s Trump-appointed president and interim executive director, Ric Grenell, announced at a conservative political convention that the center would throw a “big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas”—which wouldn’t necessarily be different from last year’s Christmas-carol sing-alongs and performance of Handel’s Messiah. Steve Bannon generated headlines when he told the crowd at the same conference that the Kennedy Center would feature a performance by the J6 Prison Choir, but that idea might have been a figment of his fertile imagination. (Bannon’s speech included an elaborate fantasy in which, while the choir sings, “the elite” is taken “down to the D.C. gulag.”) The prediction seemed to catch the venue’s bookers off guard; the center told the Los Angeles Times that “we do not have any information on this as a Kennedy Center confirmed event.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s directives so far have been vague. The Kennedy Center “got very wokey,” Trump told the organization’s board last month. “I think we’re going to make it hot.” Earlier this week, he reminded the board how much he loves The Phantom of the Opera and wondered aloud if one of the original Cats actors is still alive (Betty Buckley, and she is).\n\nEven so, for some of those who canceled their Kennedy Center appearances, the choice was an easy one. “I wish I could say there was some sort of decision tree, or there was angst over it, or I had moments of doubt. There was none,” the mystery author Louise Penny, who canceled her Kennedy Center book launch, told me. “I simply couldn’t do it and feel good about myself.” Adam Weiner, the front man for the rock band Low Cut Connie, told me, “It’s very clear that the Kennedy Center is the arts wing of the Trump regime, and I think that artists need to make a stand very early—right now.”\n\nThe cancelers—at least a dozen as of this writing—seem to believe that the place is doomed, so their decision doesn’t matter much anyway. José Olivares, who performs with the Puerto Rican indie band Balún, told me that the “transition” at the Kennedy Center “is going to happen regardless, whether Balún would have played or not.”\n\nArtists who are choosing to perform tend to approach the matter differently. They’re focused on the tangible effects of their decisions, not on whether their conscience is weighed down by the new chairman’s anti-“wokey”-ness.\n\nStephen Marche: America’s cultural revolution\n\nAbigale Reisman, the violinist for the Ezekiel’s Wheels Klezmer Band, told me that her initial reaction after Trump’s Kennedy Center takeover was “Fuck them all; fuck the whole place.” But after thinking about the situation, seeking out other opinions, and spending an entire rehearsal talking about it instead of rehearsing, she and the rest of the band decided to play their March 5 gig.\n\nThey were swayed, in part, by the realization that pulling out might wind up punishing the Kennedy Center staff. One employee’s testimony was especially persuasive: “His message to all of us was ‘Don’t abandon us,’” recalls Nat Seelen, the band’s clarinetist. Another group the performers didn’t want to abandon: the audience. Alicia Waller, the jazz singer who performed the Xhosa song at her Kennedy Center show late last month, is from Oakton, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. “At the end of my performance, these four little girls who look like me when I was little ran up to me with stars in their eyes, and I was like, ‘That’s what this performance is about,’” Waller told me.\n\nMany artists and patrons have a nightmare scenario in mind for the Kennedy Center: that it becomes so neglected as to be irrelevant except as a venue for the few artists who support Trump. That’s not the case yet, but liberal artists canceling their performance makes it more likely, not less. “We don’t want to comply in advance,” Kirsten Lamb, the bassist and singer for Ezekiel’s Wheels, told me.\n\nMany of the performers took advantage of the opportunity to score some points at Trump’s expense. Dwayne Kennedy, the comedian who opened for W. Kamau Bell at his Kennedy Center performance last month, told the audience, “Welcome to the last time two Black guys are going to be at the Kennedy Center.” Ezekiel’s Wheels announced during their performance that their “hearts are with Ukraine” and that history teaches us to fight against government control of the arts, and urged the audience to think about migrants as they listened to a performance by the descendants of migrants.\n\nStatements like these carry their own risks. The Kennedy Center’s new leader is not known for his tolerance of dissent. If he comes to view the institution as a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment, he might take bigger steps to interfere with its programming than he otherwise would. But then, at least the performers will know that it was his decision—not theirs.",

        "title": "A Warning for Columbia University",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nColumbia University faces one of the most consequential choices of its nearly three-century history this week. The Trump administration has given the school a deadline of tomorrow to make a series of concessions in exchange for keeping $400 million in federal funding. Columbia has not publicly signaled what it will do, but The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the university was close to yielding to the demands. That would be a disaster for Columbia, for American higher education, and for the United States.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to dictate how the university disciplines students involved in pro-Palestinian protests last year, structures its disciplinary processes, handles masking on campus, and runs its admissions. It also demands that the university begin the process of placing its Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies under “academic receivership for a minimum of five years,” a process where universities put departments that have failed to govern themselves under the supervision of some university official outside the department.\n\nThese demands are ostensibly about addressing anti-Semitism on Columbia’s campus. Anti-Semitism is a genuine problem at the school, but these are not genuine fixes. This is an attempt by the federal government to take control of an elite private university that it sees, correctly, as a bastion of liberalism. The gambit against the MESAAS department makes this especially clear; as a member of the American Association of University Professors’ academic-freedom committee told the Associated Press, “Even during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.” These demands come as the Trump administration is also seeking to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the protests at Columbia last year and a legal permanent resident. The government has still not charged him with any crime.\n\nIn their defense, Columbia’s leaders are right to be worried about the threat of a funding cut. As my colleague Ian Bogost has explained, American higher education as we know it depends greatly on federal money. This is not a matter of charity: The nation benefits heavily from research and education. The $400 million ransom here comes on top of other cuts to federal funding for universities. Yet many experts don’t think that the government’s threats would stand up to legal challenge.\n\nUniversity leaders may also agree with some of the diagnoses the federal government has made about its admissions or disciplinary practices, but these are problems for the university to handle itself. (One bleak possibility right now is that administrators would rather let the federal government take the blame for changes they want to make than face backlash from students, donors, faculty, or alumni.)\n\nSurrendering to Donald Trump, however, would be a serious error. The first impact would be on Columbia itself, which would be granting control to an administration that has been frank about its desire to knock universities down a few notches. Concession would probably provoke outrage from faculty and students, which could cause tumult, could harm the university’s reputation, and—crucially—is likely to only invite further attacks from the White House. It’s a death spiral waiting to happen.\n\nColumbia should know this better than most schools. When House Republicans assailed it over the Gaza-war protests last year, President Minouche Shafik bent over backwards to answer their concerns. It satisfied no one. She lost the confidence of the university community and resigned in August. The ritual bloodletting did not appease the right, as the current pressure campaign shows, but rather emboldened it. The White House is already looking past Columbia to its next target, the University of Pennsylvania, and if these sorties are successful, other colleges will be next.\n\nThis is a consistent pattern when people and institutions seek accommodation from this president in order to protect themselves. There’s no such thing as an armistice with Trump; there’s only ever a temporary truce.\n\nIn 2016, the Republican Party as a whole opted to indulge Trump’s candidacy, on the premise that he couldn’t possibly win the nomination. When he did, leaders decided to work with him, on the premise that he was inexperienced and policy-ignorant and could be manipulated to serve their ends. Instead, he has conducted a full-scale takeover, remaking the GOP platform in his image, purging opponents, and turning the Republican National Committee into an arm of his business.\n\nIn that 2016 race, Chris Christie was the first rival candidate to endorse Trump and assist him. That won him a job leading the Trump transition—until he was unceremoniously fired, became the butt of cruel Trump jokes, and emerged as a prominent Trump critic, once it was too late.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell also chose to work with Trump and defend him, including some of his baseless claims about the 2020 election being stolen. He seemed to believe that indulging Trump would help further his own priorities. McConnell did get scores of conservative judges appointed, but he also kept taking flak from Trump, and coddling the president helped foment the January 6 insurrection. After the riot, McConnell was furious but glad to be done with Trump. “I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,” he told the reporter Jonathan Martin. “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Couldn’t have happened at a better time.”\n\nBut McConnell didn’t want to take the political pain of pushing his caucus to convict Trump after his impeachment. The result? Trump is back as president, and McConnell is casting lonely, symbolic anti-Trump votes as he prepares to leave the Senate. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy initially blasted Trump behind closed doors after January 6, but then quickly flew to Mar-a-Lago to make amends. Yet Trump did nothing to save McCarthy from an internal revolt, and he was deposed as speaker.\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pompeo ran or considered running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, but both eventually endorsed Trump. Haley practically begged to stump for him. Once elected, Trump promptly shut both out of his new administration and later yanked a security detail assigned to Pompeo because of death threats from Iran—stemming from Pompeo’s work as secretary of state under Trump. Many business executives lined up behind Trump in this election as well, hoping he’d be good for the economy. Instead, they’ve gotten gyrating markets and fears of a recession.\n\nForeign leaders have also tried to get on Trump’s good side. France’s Emmanuel Macron has been very effective at building a friendly relationship with the U.S. president as a way of fortifying his interests. As a reward for that effort, Trump has slapped large tariffs on Europe, threatened to bail on NATO, and turned his back on Ukraine, a major European priority. It’s no wonder that Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky was willing to spar with Trump in the Oval Office. Stand up to Trump and he’ll punish you; act conciliatory and he’ll do it anyway.\n\nBack in 2019, the journalist Andrew Sullivan warned against accommodating Trump. “We are appeasing an angry king,” he wrote. “And the usual result of appeasement is that the angry king banks every concession and, empowered and emboldened by his success, gets more aggressive and more power hungry.”\n\nAs it happens, Columbia was founded in 1754 as King’s College. An imprudent choice now could result in the school becoming the de facto fief of an aspiring angry king.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nDonald Trump signed an executive order today that is set to dramatically shrink the Department of Education, but the department would still continue some functions, such as administering student loans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Tens of thousands of articles on Pentagon websites were removed or flagged for removal to comply with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s order to erase “diversity” content. According to CNN, which obtained a database showing which content has been or could be purged, these articles cover topics including Holocaust remembrance, Jackie Robinson’s military service, and breast-cancer awareness. The Pentagon has since restored some of the removed pages. A Georgetown University researcher on a student visa was detained by federal immigration authorities over alleged ties to a senior adviser to Hamas, which his lawyer denies.\n\nDispatches\n\nTime-Travel Thursdays: The Reagan administration offers a cautionary tale about cost-cutting zeal crashing up against the reality of how government works, David A.

        "content": "The Palisades Fire burned its way through Jennifer Champion’s life. It started in the hills where her family liked to hike and moved along the roads she took with her daughters to Elysse’s high school (burned), Annabelle’s middle school (partially burned), and Charlise’s day care (too damaged to use). Nearby, her husband owned three sober-living facilities (one burned; the other two are now uninhabitable, surrounded by rubble). The roof and front wall collapsed at the grocery store where Charlise would get free sprinkle cookies; the one down the street is a pile of warped steel. Champion’s family had lived in the Palisades for about 16 years and, two years ago, leased a house they’d hoped to stay in long-term. That home burned. So did most of the other ones on their street.\n\nNow they are living about 45 minutes away, in Manhattan Beach, where some other Palisades friends relocated too. “Is it convenient for all of us? None of us,” Champion told me, but they wanted to stay together. Elysse transferred to a high school in Santa Monica, about an hour away in traffic, with Palisades friends; Annabelle’s school found a temporary location there too. Champion’s job at Pepperdine University can be nearly two hours away. But she isn’t sure she will be able to keep it anyway, especially now that they don’t have child care for Charlise.\n\nThey are past the first days of the fire—evacuating, securing temporary housing—and the first few weeks—finding a long-term rental, furnishing it with donations from a friend, buying pillows and cutlery. But “none of us know what to do next,” Champion said. Her Palisades friends talk: Do they stay where they are and make Manhattan Beach their home? Rebuilding the Palisades will take years. But right now, they all want to go back if they can.\n\nIn January, I drove through Altadena, the other neighborhood destroyed by that month’s fires, with Frank Bigelow, Cal Fire’s deputy director of wildfire preparedness. At lot after lot after lot, the only bit of house still standing was the chimney. The air was acrid and quiet. To Bigelow, the scene recalled an image from a 1961 fire that razed Bel Air, about five miles from the Palisades. (Local legend in Malibu holds that the town’s flock of colorful parrots is descended from pets that escaped Bel Air’s burning homes.)\n\nThe L.A. Fire Department produced a documentary postmortem a year later about all the ways the city had built itself flammable. That old film, he told me, “speaks to every one of the issues we saw” in January—a brush fire that quickly became an urban one; clogged evacuation routes; hydrants running dry; houses built on steep hillsides, where flames travel fastest. Bigelow rewatches it every few years. At the end, over black-and-white footage of a rubble neighborhood, the narrator intones: “Now fireplaces stand as tombstones over row upon row of dead homes on dead streets.” As we drove, Bigelow pointed to the chimneys. “Tombstones,” he said.\n\nAfter the 1961 fire, people kept building in Bel Air and into the hills. My father grew up one neighborhood over and, in the 1970s, bought a plot of land in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, overlooking Malibu, where I grew up. And all of the ignition points that humans brought in—power lines, heavy equipment, cars, cigarette butts—started more fires than the land was adapted to handle. Southern California’s chaparral needs fire to regenerate, but historically, it burned only every 30 to 100 years, Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute, told me. More frequent fires meant it no longer had enough time to recover between burns, so non-native grasses—far more flammable—filled the gaps. Over time, the landscape has become more and more fit to burn. When a wildfire came through my neighborhood in 1993, it traced a similar path to a fire from 1970, and traveled through burn scars from seven other fires. That 1993 conflagration lapped at the windows of my childhood home; the Palisades Fire finally burned it down.\n\nRead: The place where I grew up is gone\n\nCalifornia has tried to build for the inevitable. After the Bel Air fire, Los Angeles updated its building codes, outlawing wood-shingled roofs and mandating that homeowners clear the brush around their house. Since 2008, the state has required that new homes in extremely fire-prone areas—such as my childhood neighborhood and much of the Palisades—have fire-resistant siding, tempered glass, and ember-resistant eves and vents. Many homes in the Palisades were constructed long before 2008 and, when they’re rebuilt, will be brought up to those standards. Fire can consume even the most defensible house, but if everyone designs less flammably, the whole neighborhood is less likely to go, Emily Schlickman, a fire-resiliency researcher at UC Davis, told me. In her ideal world, high-risk communities would have a ring of cleared land around them as a firebreak, robbing the flames of fuel. The local government in Paradise, California, which was destroyed by the 2018 Camp Fire, is trying to buy up land around the community to do precisely that. But many vulnerable places forgo such measures because they could do everything right and burn anyway.\n\nLos Angeles is still trying to decide how to remake its destroyed neighborhoods. A commission of volunteer experts will give the county recommendations on reconstructing (and retrofitting) the area for future disasters. Steve Soboroff, the real-estate developer whom Mayor Karen Bass appointed chief recovery officer, has promised that the Palisades will be rebuilt resiliently (and, also, somehow have their Fourth of July parade this year). And the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently pledged to put all of the Palisades’ power lines underground. In the days after the fire, some Angelenos and experts also advocated for dramatically remaking the Palisades—to be denser, for instance, with firebreaks around the community—but those notions may already be more or less moot. Many residents simply want to get home as quickly as possible, and the city and state have waived certain permitting requirements for those who want to rebuild essentially their same house on the same lot.\n\nEvery time these fires wreak this level of damage, people look at the melted cars, curled stucco, and thousands of displaced residents and ask: Should human beings return to these places at all? “When most of us build or buy a home, we carefully appraise the neighborhood. In Malibu the neighborhood is fire. Fire that revisits the coastal mountains several times a decade,” Mike Davis wrote in his famous essay “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn.” (You can tell what he thought of our whole shrubland coastal-living experiment.) Taxpayer dollars helped rebuild these areas, many occupied by rich people, again and again and again. Why not just accept that this coastline is kindling and move on?\n\nBut abandoning these landscapes altogether just isn’t realistic, researchers told me. Almost a third of all housing in the continental U.S. is already in places where settlements and wilderness intermix. All those people can’t just move. And abandonment isn’t always the best way to manage fires, either. Move everyone out of these half-wild places, and you may have taken away the people who were clearing brush and otherwise reducing the fire risk for the city nearby, Miriam Greenberg, a disaster researcher at UC Santa Cruz who studies the wildland-urban interface, told me. Leaving these areas untouched, Greenberg said, means “the potential for future disasters increases significantly for those adjacent urban areas, which is most of California.”\n\nPeople have chosen to live here, with fire, for generations. My classmate and her father attended the same middle school; my friends’ parents and grandparents have been in Malibu for decades. A friend recently walked me through his home, which was severely smoke-damaged in the Palisades Fire and which, he told me, was a rebuild: The house had burned down in the 1993 fire. I asked if he’d ever leave, and he laughed: “When I die, I guess.”\n\nMost displaced residents I spoke with want to come home. Ginny Wiley, now in her 80s, grew up in her grandfather’s store, a wooden shack called Wiley’s Bait and Tackle, and took it over decades later. She used to live behind the shop, in what had once been a cottage-style motel for the construction workers who built the Pacific Coast Highway. When the state bought the bungalows to preserve as a historic site, Wiley moved into an apartment in the Pacific Palisades. The fire leveled Wiley’s Bait, the bungalows, and her apartment; she lived in her car for a month and then in a temporary Airbnb. She told me she hopes to rebuild: “I’m going to stay with the store as long as I can.”\n\nInsurance helps. But in my community, the difference between “good” and “okay” coverage is already determining people’s futures. Lisa Machenberg and her husband are going to rent nearby while building a home with enough room for future grandchildren; the Amirani family, whose daughter I used to play softball with, hope to live in a trailer on their burned lot, if they can afford to rebuild. Their private insurer dropped them a few years ago—one of the many companies that stopped writing policies in California—and the Amiranis estimate that their coverage will foot only about half the cost of construction.\n\nRenters like Jennifer Champion and her family have no guarantee that they can return to the neighborhood. The Champions asked their landlord if they could purchase his burned lot, but he doesn’t plan to sell. Jennifer’s eldest daughter reminds her that, by the time the Palisades take form again, she will be away at college. Still, the Champions have added themselves to a directory, Protect Pali, that matches people looking to live in the Palisades with residents who want to sell their land.\n\nRead: How to rebuild from the ashes\n\nBecause not everyone wants to come back. Jane Warden refuses to rebuild. In 2018, when the Woolsey Fire came through the western half of Malibu (spared by the Palisades Fire this year), it burned down the home where she’d raised her children and spent 10 years growing a garden of eucalyptus, palm trees, and pine trees—highly flammable plants that are everywhere in this part of California. Nick Tinoco, a sociologist at UCLA, followed people in Woolsey’s aftermath and told me that most people he’d spoken with had initially planned to rebuild. But only about 40 percent of the homes lost in that fire have been. The reality, Tinoco found, “was two-plus years of them trying to rebuild and then reaching a point where it was either better for them financially or psychically to let go and move on,” even if only to the next town over. (Trees in the canyons are still black from Woolsey; my prom date’s house is now an overgrown lot of mustard and jimson weed.) People tend to think climate migration is driven by the desire to flee a hazardous place, Tinoco said, but really, it is a by-product of “the long process of trying to stay.”\n\nWarden had originally planned to rebuild too, but she got so fed up with permitting that she sold her lot; the buyer quickly built a giant house, and sold it for four times what Warden had paid for the original, she told me. She moved to a neighborhood on the other side of Malibu so her kids could stay in the same school. She started a new garden of less flammable native plants and made a five-foot hardscape perimeter of sand and gravel around her home. The Palisades Fire burned down her house again anyway, and most of her neighborhood.\n\nHer HOA is talking about using factory-built homes when their community rebuilds. “It makes sense, right? Because then you can replace your house easily, if we start thinking of housing as more semipermanent,” she told me. But she personally plans never to live in Malibu again. Losing a house to fire “twice is okay, but three times starts to feel like carelessness,” she said. She will replace her Christmas ornaments for the second time, but she has given up on keeping a personal library and has been leaving books wherever she finishes them. She and her husband are considering moving to the East Coast or to nearby Santa Monica, where the fire risk is generally lower (although portions of it were evacuated in January).\n\nFire is a brutal sorting mechanism, deciding who can actually afford to live in a place and who can’t. More money generally enters an area after a fire, because they tend to happen in coveted landscapes, Kathryn McConnell, a disaster sociologist at the University of British Columbia, told me. Five years after Northern California’s Camp Fire, home prices in Paradise have gone up, and so has the number of houses sold that were built on spec, according to a study published last month. Only about five of the area’s 30 mobile-home parks have been rebuilt. The Palisades and Malibu are already extraordinarily expensive places to live; the fires will likely make them more so. The median home price in the Palisades is north of $4 million, and the median income is a little less than $200,000. Some people have been living in the homes their grandparents bought years ago or, like my parents, in mobile-home parks (two of which burned in the Palisades). But after a fire, rebuilding an old house can be financially impossible, especially if it was underinsured, and mobile-home parks might never reopen if the owners decide to sell and move on.\n\nSo far, investors have been the earliest buyers of the burnt lots that people have put on the market. The first one sold in the Palisades belonged to an art teacher, who asked for $999,000 and got about $1.2 million. Richard Schulman, the real-estate agent who brokered the deal, told me that the buyer is a real-estate investor who plans to either build a spec home to sell or just sit on the land for a few years until more people move back and the property values rise.\n\nSchulman is bullish on the Palisades. “This is very valuable land to be on,” he said—secluded yet convenient, with ocean views and a sea breeze. Last month, I stood with him in a leveled townhouse complex along the road where, during the fire, evacuating residents abandoned their vehicles and ran. A mudslide had since closed the lower half of it. “I’m 99 percent sure this is the unit here,” Schulman said, indicating some undulating stucco indistinguishable from the other undulating stucco. He told me that this particular pile was a condo he’d recently listed—a great buy, he said, for a highly speculative investor.\n\nA small patch of grass on the burnt hillside was still alive. Schulman pointed at the unburnt bit: “If you look at it the right way, it’s like, This is beautiful. There’s trees; there’s green.” The air smelled of eucalyptus and dead fish, which were lying on the walkway beside us. They had survived the fire, only for the recent rains to wash them out of the community pond. Schulman made a picture frame out of his thumbs and forefingers and held it toward the hill. “If you ignore the burnt hillside back there,” he said, “this is a great place to live.”",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "At this year’s South by Southwest festival, in Austin, film premieres weren’t the only major events. The buzziest affair, arguably, took place inside a truck: a facsimile of the Criterion Collection’s fabled office closet, bursting with select editions of its deep and idiosyncratic film catalog. For three minutes each, movie lovers could enter the Criterion Closet truck to rifle through the company’s expansive archive of canonical works, plucking DVD and Blu-ray copies to purchase and take home. Part of the fun is that the experience is captured on video, giving visitors their own personal installment of the beloved “Criterion Closet Picks” YouTube series, which features famous artists explaining their favorite selections.\n\nThe hundreds of festivalgoers waiting their turn suggest a draw beyond the physical pleasures of picking out and buying a handful of Criterion films, though. The real appeal of the Criterion Closet is emotional. It’s a place to let your movie obsessions—your obscure taste, your love of cult classics, your knowledge of directorial deep cuts—run wild and then be recognized for them.\n\nBob Stein co-founded the Criterion Collection in 1984 with the modest goal of releasing contemporary and classic films on home video. He dressed them up with stunning dust jackets and booklets, and they came with special features such as audio commentaries. Over the following decades, Criterion’s catalog expanded from a few hundred entries on LaserDisc to more than 1,600 across DVD and Blu-ray. The brand is now synonymous with an impressive swath of cinema: films that are challenging and avant-garde; that were once maligned but have developed loyal followings; that threatened to be lost to time.\n\nAt one point, the New York–based company needed storage for its growing stockpile. The discs ended up in a humble supply closet in the office, which has since become both an archival treasure trove and a destination for those in the know. In 2010, Criterion began uploading videos to YouTube of the most notable people to peruse the closet’s offerings: filmmakers, actors, other influential cultural figures. Viewers can now watch well-known names such as the director John Waters, the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, and the actor Zoë Kravitz gleefully traipse through this cinephile’s Candyland, given free rein to pick through the extensive library. As they talk about why a particular selection intrigues them, the famous visitors flash the disc covers at the camera. Inevitably, they leave with an armful of DVDs, composed of films they love and others they want to see; the complete list is revealed at the video’s end.\n\nRead: A streaming service for cinephiles\n\nThe “Closet Picks” videos have helped Criterion grow “from a more insular, cinephile-first cult favorite to a more mass phenomenon,” as GQ noted in a story about the series last year. The most popular installments garner hundreds of thousands of views and generate viral clips in part because of their savvy choice of featured guests. It’s not unusual for an actor or a director to appear while promoting their latest film, yet fail to mention it—they’re too dazzled by all the beautiful DVDs.\n\nInstead, the joy of watching the series lies in the visitors’ authentic, unvarnished delight. Take the actor Ayo Edebiri’s entry, from July; the Bear actor’s love of film is well documented, and in her video, she buzzes with anticipation, immediately addressing viewers who she knows would feel similarly upon entering the closet: “I’m on these sales,” she says, referencing Criterion’s frequent discounts. “I’m getting these 50 percent off DVDs, just like you are.” Edebiri brings along a list of her intended picks, including the black comedy To Sleep With Anger and the heist thriller Thief—two wildly different choices that speak to her wide-ranging tastes. Hundreds of posters on Reddit and YouTube expressed how much they could envision themselves as the ecstatic star, right down to her outfit: “Between the prepared list on her phone and the Radiohead t-shirt I feel like this was the closest the comments section has been to having one of us in the closet,” reads one YouTube reply.\n\nThe videos, at their best, help transform famous figures into more personable ones. The directors Josh and Benny Safdie almost can’t get the words out quickly enough as they rhapsodize about Mike Leigh’s harrowing dramedy Meantime and recall how Charlie Chaplin’s silent-era masterpiece The Kid made Benny cry. Their trip to the closet, in a way, gives new context to the Safdie brothers’ work, as viewers realize that the makers of the stress-inducing black comedy Uncut Gems are in fact goofy, sincere film nerds.\n\nMany guests also approach the Criterion Closet as if it’s a hallowed institution. The actor Gael García Bernal veers into philosophical territory with his choices; when he grabs the Italian neorealist triumph Blow-Up, he discusses how its themes of surveillance and paranoia resonate with him. He relates his yearning for the era before cellphones and the idle time that came with it, a wistful and humanizing admission.\n\nThe “Closet Picks” series lets these textured portraits emerge from visitors and viewers alike. The comment sections have cultivated a community of discerning movie lovers, filled with people sharing their takes on each guest’s picks. They mimic the warmth of video stores, those communal spaces where like-minded cinephiles could congregate and bond by debating the best Alfred Hitchcock movies or gushing over auteurs such as Akira Kurosawa and John Carpenter. The fervor around the video series and the Closet truck underscores, ultimately, how few offline places there are today for movie lovers to come together.\n\nThe Criterion Closet is, in some ways, an exclusive club; you need to be invited to the company’s office, which typically means being a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry. Yet “Closet Picks” manages to convey the thrill that comes with discovering great art, as well as those who share your love for it. The series does something potent with something very simple: When we see a person we admire geek out over cinema’s transformative power, they’re revealing how they came to see the world—and how we all might fit into it.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Is Cautious for a Reason",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "When I walked into Chuck Schumer’s Brooklyn apartment, he was puttering around in his socks. This wasn’t household policy, the 74-year-old Democratic Senate minority leader assured me, so there was no need for me to shed my shoes. But, as a gesture of hospitality, he asked, “Do you mind if I keep mine off?” I didn’t seem to have any actual say in the matter, and so minutes later, we were lounging on the L-shaped sofa in his study, as he discoursed on the color of the walls—call it terra-cotta—that he told me he really likes, but his wife, Iris, doesn’t.\n\nHe had invited me over because there was a hole in his schedule. This was supposed to be the week that he embarked on a multicity tour for his new book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning. The launch was going to be his literary bar mitzvah, where he would bask in the glory of publication. Schumer had poured himself into the project, forcing himself to write intimately about his career, his faith, and his actual bar mitzvah, an event that had come to feel like an omen. Then, as now, the outside world trampled his big moment, and Schumer disappointed loved ones at the very moment he hoped to reap their praise.\n\nAs he tells the story, he was scheduled to become a man, in the eyes of the Jewish community, on November 23, 1963—a case of terrible timing, because Lee Harvey Oswald killed the president a day earlier. Even though nobody was in the mood to celebrate anything, his family plowed ahead with the event. And in front of a mournful congregation, Schumer choked. He humiliatingly fumbled through his Torah portion and had no fun at the party that followed. His abiding memory of the day is his father arguing with the caterer to recoup the costs for the after-dinner drinks that never were served.\n\nFrom the April 2024 issue: The golden age of American Jews is ending\n\nSimilarly inopportune timing has wrecked the launch of his book. Days before its publication, he announced that he would be supporting a Republican continuing resolution that would prevent a government shutdown. The decision was wildly unpopular with his party’s rank and file, who accused him of squandering the Democrats’ last remaining source of leverage over the Trump administration.\n\nOn The Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked him: “Senator Schumer, no disrespect, but you are a disgrace to Jewish stereotypes about financial negotiation.” Outside Schumer’s Park Slope apartment, on seemingly every mailbox and street sign, there were posters with his photo that read, Missing Backbone … If Found Contact Charles Schumer.\n\nSchumer’s security team began to track specific threats against him. They worried that the furor over the shutdown would create a wave of protests that would test their ability to safeguard him. So Schumer accepted advice that he postpone his tour for a more placid moment in the indeterminate future.\n\nWith newfound time on his hands, Schumer and I began to kibitz. He splayed on his sofa, tucked his stocking feet under his knees and propped his head on his hand, striking a Cleopatra pose. He badly wanted to talk about his neglected book and not the continuing resolution. But I began to realize that the two subjects were, in fact, woven together. The book is unintentionally a political self-portrait. Schumer’s Jewish identity is at the core of his beliefs: that the viability of public institutions should be defended at all cost; that the fragility of Jewish existence, and of democracy, demands that he resist emotionally satisfying gestures, if they ultimately risk damaging those institutions.\n\nFew American politicians are more unmistakably Jewish than Chuck Schumer. Soon after he joined the House of Representatives in the early 1980s, he recalls in the book, a woman in Queens rushed up to him: “You have more courage than any of the other members of Congress.” Schumer didn’t just take the compliment. He wanted to know why she was lavishing him with such praise. “You’re the only one who had the courage to wear a yarmulke,” she told him. To disabuse her of that idea, he bent down to show her “the appetizer-plate-sized bald spot”—his words—that she had confused for a skullcap.\n\nDespite the expectations Jews might have had for him, he didn’t define himself that way. He told me, “I was always proudly Jewish, but I never emphasized Jewishness. When I ran for the Senate, I was really worried. How would these upstate people react to me?” (Perhaps he need not have worried; he defeated the incumbent, Alfonse D’Amato, after an only-in-New-York controversy over whether the Republican senator had called Schumer a putzhead, a riff on the Yiddish slang for penis.)\n\nDecades passed, and his cautious attitude didn’t change. But then, on October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, and Schumer felt a new sense of responsibility. No Jew in American political life had ever held the power he then possessed. (The Democrats held a majority in the Senate, so he was running the chamber.) Witnessing the outpouring of anti-Semitism on the left, which focused its harshest criticisms on Israel rather than Hamas, Schumer felt compelled to fully embrace his identity, in all the ways he’d historically resisted.\n\nHis decision to expend so much time talking about anti-Semitism didn’t please his aides, who urged him to steer clear. On the political merits, his staff had valid arguments. Schumer planned on chastising the left, attacking members of the party he led. He writes that he was determined to make a fervent case for Israel, despite that country’s diminishing popularity among die-hard Democrats. He recalls telling himself, “You are no great Jewish sage or scholar, you are no King Solomon or Maimonides or Elie Wiesel, but for better or for worse, you are here, and you ought to try to do some good.”\n\nRead: Trump’s crocodile tears for the Jews\n\nWhat’s interesting about the book was that writing it didn’t just inspire him to more strongly identify himself as a Jew, but also prodded him to consider the Jewish roots of his approach to politics. (Full disclosure: At several points in his book, Schumer approvingly quotes an essay I wrote about Judaism in America.)\n\nHe began to think back to his time as a student at Harvard, in the late ’60s. Even though he protested against the Vietnam War, just like his classmates, he didn’t like how they took over buildings in the name of the movement. In the book, he recalls, “I was never going to be on the side of the radicals. I was going to take my own path and try to work through the system and get results, even if it meant compromise and concession from time to time.”\n\nSchumer’s recollections of that era mirror his current difference of opinion with his base over the government shutdown. “Even if I failed and they shut me down and some of them told me I was a sellout,” he writes, “I would try to convince them to seek progress with me on the issues we both cared about. It was more of a human principle and less of a political one.”\n\nWhen I brought up this passage, he told me that this human principle grew subconsciously, at least in part, from his Jewishness. Schumer viewed the preservation of American institutions as a matter of Jewish preservation, because those institutions were equipped to protect religious minorities. They were the source of America’s exceptional tolerance of Jews: “One of the great things about America is we’ve always had these norms, and we don’t want them broken,” he said, “because they protect all Americans, but particularly Jewish people, who have been so subject to problems and vilification through the centuries.”\n\nIn the past few weeks, many of the American institutions he reveres, and the constitutional system designed to insulate them, have come under intense pressure that they might not withstand. And, apropos of Schumer’s book, Trump has created conditions for anti-Semitism to flourish. The president has surrounded himself with a disturbing collection of appointees with records of repeating old canards about Jewish power.\n\nAs Schumer explained the president’s attitude toward Jews, he told me a story that he’d left out of the manuscript: After Trump came to office in 2017, he invited congressional leaders to meet with him. “There’s a spread in the White House, and the first thing he says to me is, ‘Chuck, have a pig in the blanket. They’re kosher.’ First, I’m not sure they were kosher. Second, what was he thinking? He’s a Jew.” (I reached out to the White House for comment on this anecdote and have not yet heard back.)\n\nTrump, in his autocratic mode, seemingly ascribed himself the power to determine what’s kosher and not. And more than that, he’s determined that he has the ability to determine who’s a Jew and not. Last week, he bizarrely declared that Schumer “is not Jewish anymore.” In the words of the president of the United States, “He has become a Palestinian.” (“Don’t tell my mother,” Schumer told me in response.)\n\nThe president was assuming a posture that rarely ends well, in which the regime separates the good Jews from the bad ones. By deeming them religious reprobates, the regime is signaling that they are the acceptable ones to abuse.\n\nDoes Schumer’s institutionalism have the fortitude to resist Trump? When he voted to prevent the government shutdown, he was acting not just on instinct, but on intelligence gleaned from Republican sources, who told him that the administration was baiting the Democrats into shutting down the government. The White House had a plan for how it would use the cover of a shutdown to accelerate its assault on the government, while pinning blame for the crisis on the Democrats.\n\nBut Schumer was also acting on instinct. As he remembers the radicals at Harvard, he says, “I saw how their zeal and fury led them to be not only demeaning to other students but disruptive, which was ultimately counterproductive. They turned too many people off.” In the end, he was right, and they were wrong. The backlash against antiwar protest helped doom ’60s liberalism, ending the Great Society and stalling the advance of civil rights.\n\nAs I sat with him on the sofa, I received an alert from Axios: “Schumer faces growing House Dem calls to step down.” But he seemed unfazed. “The higher you go on the mountain, the more fiercely the wind blows,” he told me. “The only way to protect yourself from these fierce winds is to have your own internal gyroscope. That’s what motivated me in how I voted.” The same instinct motivated him back at Harvard, he said. “I hated the Vietnam War, but I felt there was a right way.” He was now lying on his back, his feet propped up, the knot of his tie dangling at his torso, a man either oblivious to the revolt brewing against him or at ease with his own political choices.",

        "content": "Sign up for Trump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nNo one can say they didn’t know.\n\nDuring his first official campaign rally for the 2024 Republican nomination, held in Waco, Texas, Donald Trump vowed retribution against those he perceives as his enemies.\n\n“I am your warrior,” he said to his supporters. “I am your justice. For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nSixty days into Trump’s second term, we have begun to see what that looks like.\n\nThe president fired the archivist of the United States because he was enraged at the National Archives for notifying the Justice Department of his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office following his first term. (The archivist he fired hadn’t even been working for the agency at the time, but that didn’t matter.) He also fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, a traditionally independent regulatory agency, in violation of Supreme Court precedent and quite likely the language of the statute that created it. (Both members plan to sue to reverse the firings.)\n\nRead: Gulag humor is now everywhere in D.C.\n\nTrump stripped security details from people he had appointed to high office in his first administration and subsequently fell out with, including General Mark Milley, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, the former diplomat Brian Hook, and the infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci. The National Institutes of Health, where Fauci worked for 45 years, is being gutted by the Trump administration. The environment there has become “suffocatingly toxic,” as my colleague Katherine J. Wu reported.\n\nTrump has sued networks and newspapers for millions of dollars. His Federal Communications Commission is investigating several outlets. And he has called CNN and MSNBC “corrupt” and “illegal”—not because they have broken any laws, but simply because they have been critical of him.\n\nTrump’s FBI director, Kash Patel, told the MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon in a 2023 interview that “we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections—we’re going to come after you.”\n\nTrump has also come after the legal profession, expanding his attacks on private law firms and threatening the ability of lawyers to do their job and private citizens to obtain legal counsel. U.S. Marshals have warned federal judges of unusually high threat levels as Elon Musk and other Trump-administration allies “ramp up efforts to discredit judges,” according to a Reuters report. On his social-media site, Musk has attacked judges in more than 30 posts since the end of January, calling them “corrupt,” “radical,” and “evil,” and deriding the “TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY.”\n\nEarlier this week, Trump targeted a federal judge, James E. Boasberg, who ordered a pause in deportations being carried out under an obscure wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump, who ignored that court order, called the judge a “Radical Left Lunatic” and demanded his impeachment. (Chief Justice John Roberts responded to the president’s attack with a rare public rebuke.) Trump and his supporters are clearly looking for a showdown with the judicial branch, which could precipitate a constitutional crisis.\n\nBut that’s hardly where the efforts at intimidation end. Trump’s antipathy for Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was on vivid display a few weeks ago, when the president berated Zelensky in a televised Oval Office meeting. Trump’s hostility toward the Ukrainian president, whom he referred to as a “dictator,” is explained in part by his long-standing affinity for totalitarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine three years ago. But it almost surely also has to do with Trump’s embrace of a conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to defeat him. (In fact it was Russia, not Ukraine, that interfered in the election, and on behalf of Trump.)\n\nLast Friday, in the Great Hall of the Justice Department, the president described his adversaries as “scum,” “savages,” and “Marxists,” as well as “deranged,” “thugs,” “violent vicious lawyers,” and “a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government.”\n\nNo one has any doubt what this means: The department is under Trump’s personal control. As if to underscore the point, Attorney General Pam Bondi, who called Trump “the greatest president in the history of our country,” said she works “at the directive of Donald Trump.” The Justice Department is Trump’s weapon for revenge. And his appetite for vengeance is insatiable.\n\nREVENGE HAS LONG BEEN a central theme for Donald Trump. In a 1992 interview with the journalist Charlie Rose, Trump was asked if he had regrets. Among them, he told Rose, “I would have wiped the floor with the guys who weren’t loyal, which I will now do. I love getting even with people.” When Rose interjected, “Slow up. You love getting even with people?” Trump replied, “Absolutely.”\n\nIt’s one thing for a real-estate developer to act like a vindictive narcissist; it’s entirely another for an American president to act that way. And in Trump’s case, he’s been untethered in his second term in ways he wasn’t in his first, when top aides were able to check some of his worst tendencies. That won’t happen this time.\n\nThe threat this poses to American democracy is obvious. A president and an administration with a Mafia mentality can create a Mafia state. They can target innocent people, shut down dissent, intimidate critics into silence, violate democratic norms, act without any statutory authority, sweep away checks and balances, spread disinformation and conspiracy theories, ignore court orders, and even declare martial law.\n\nRead: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’\n\nWhether all of these things will come to pass is unknowable, because Trump is just getting started. But there is no reason to believe that any internal checks will keep Trump or his administration from crossing any lines. That’s especially the case since the Supreme Court issued a ruling last year that provides a former president with immunity from criminal prosecution for all “official acts” taken while in office. Trump and MAGA world interpret this, and not without cause, as giving them carte blanche. (Recall that Trump’s legal team suggested that a president’s directive for SEAL Team Six to kill a political opponent would be an action barred from prosecution, given a former executive’s broad immunity.)\n\nBUT SOMETHING ELSE, something quite far-reaching, is going on as well. Trump is having a corrosive effect on the public’s civic and moral sensibilities.\n\nIn Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville, in a section on corruption and the vices of rulers in a democracy, warned:\n\nIn a democracy private citizens see a man of their own rank in life who rises from that obscure position in a few years to riches and power; the spectacle excites their surprise and their envy, and they are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday their equal is today their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents or his virtues is unpleasant, for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they are themselves less virtuous or less talented than he was. They are therefore led, and often rightly, to impute his success mainly to some of his vices; and an odious connection is thus formed between the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness and success, utility and dishonor.\n\nTocqueville’s concern was that if citizens in a democracy saw that unethical and corrupt behavior led to “riches and power,” this would not only normalize such behavior; it would validate and even valorize it. The “odious connection” between immoral behavior and worldly success would be first made by the public, which would then emulate that behavior.\n\nThat is the great civic danger posed by Donald Trump, that the habits of his heart become the habits of our hearts; that his code of conduct becomes ours. That we delight in mistreating others almost as much as he does. That vengeance becomes nearly as important to us as it is to him. That dehumanization becomes de rigueur.\n\nTocqueville believed, as did the American Founders, that religion would be the source of republican virtues. What they didn’t anticipate was that religion might become a source of republican vices. What happens when, in many cases, religion summons the darker, and sometimes the darkest, impulses in people? When it is Christians who are excusing immoral conduct in our leaders and spreading conspiracy theories, who are at best silent at the decimation of humanitarian programs that may well lead to millions of deaths and who at worst cheer it on, and who champion a public figure who is shattering the load-bearing walls of our democracy?\n\nTHERE IS an important psychological component to all of this as well. Trump’s vindictiveness—relentless, crude, and capricious—has reshaped the emotional wiring of many otherwise good and decent people. He tapped into their fears and activated ugly passions that in the past had been kept at bay. In the process, he created a MAGA community that provides its members with a sense of purpose and feelings of solidarity.\n\nA clinical psychologist who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly told me that primal fear is an immediate, instinctual response to perceived danger. Trump was reelected, at least in part, because Americans were told for a very long time to feel very afraid. These Americans believe they will lose their country without Trump. For those in MAGA world, the feeling is: If you’re not for me and you’re not for Trump, you have no place here.\n\nThe culture war is, for them, a real war, or very close to it, and in real wars, rules have to be broken and enemies have to be destroyed.\n\n“We’re not reasonable,” Bannon told my colleague David Brooks last year. “We’re unreasonable because we’re fighting for a republic. And we’re never going to be reasonable until we get what we achieve. We’re not looking to compromise. We’re looking to win.”\n\n“Many people truly believe their country is under siege,” the psychologist I reached out to told me, “and they must abandon compromise to save their country. Decency, faith, compassion, and respect are irrelevant in wartime. If one believes their livelihood and legacy is threatened, there is no time for curiosity or compassion.”\n\nMy Atlantic colleague Jonathan Rauch wrote to me that one thing that’s surprised him is, among Trump’s supporters, “the sheer energy that’s generated by transgression. The joy of breaking stuff and hurting people. It’s a million-volt battery.” He added: “I don’t think this ends after Trump. He has raised a half generation of ambitious men and women who have been (de)socialized by his style. The most successful businessman in the world is a troll. It’s just what smart people do.”\n\nIN HIS FIRST BOOK written as president of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Václav Havel—a playwright, human-rights activist, and dissident whose words shook the foundations of the Soviet empire—meditated on politics, morality, and civility. He emphasized, again and again, “the moral origins of all genuine politics.”\n\nSome people considered him naive, a hopeless idealist, but he pushed back. “Evil will remain with us,” Havel wrote, “no one will ever eliminate human suffering, the political arena will always attract irresponsible and ambitious adventurers and charlatans. And man will not stop destroying the world. In this regard, I have no illusions.”\n\nHavel went on: “Neither I nor anyone else will ever win this war once and for all. At the very most, we can win a battle or two—and not even that is certain. Yet I still think it makes sense to wage this war persistently. It has been waged for centuries, and it will continue to be waged—we hope—for centuries to come. This must be done on principle, because it is the right thing to do.”\n\nRead: A gala for right-wing revenge\n\nThis 20th-century voice of conscience, who was arrested, tried, and convicted of subversion and spent years in jail as a political prisoner before he became president, wrote this near the end of an essay in Summer Meditations:\n\nSo anyone who claims that I am a dreamer who expects to transform hell into heaven is wrong. I have few illusions. But I feel a responsibility to work towards the things I consider good and right. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to change certain things for the better, or not at all. Both outcomes are possible. There is only one thing I will not concede: that it might be meaningless to strive in a good cause.\n\nOur republic and its ideals are supremely good causes. We should strive to protect them, which begins by speaking out for them, and by trying to do, in whatever circumstances we find ourselves, what Havel did during his ennobling and consequential life: to once again give depth and dimension to notions such as love, friendship, compassion, humility, and forgiveness. To refuse to live within the lie. And to awaken the goodwill that is slumbering within our society.",

        "content": "The American consumer is tapped out. Grocery prices are bananas, housing prices are obscene, out-of-pocket medical expenses are absurd, and child care is impossible to afford, if you can find it. To keep up with the basics, let alone the Joneses, American consumers have been charging more and more to their cards. Credit-card balances stand at an all-time high of $1.2 trillion, up more than 7 percent year-on-year, and the share of borrowers who are late on their payments has reached its highest point since the aftermath of the Great Recession. Serious delinquency rates are climbing, particularly among consumers under the age of 40.\n\nHigh costs are weighing down working-class families, while driving big rewards to rich ones. Over the past few decades, the credit-card market has quietly transformed into two credit-card markets: one offering generous benefits to wealthy Americans, the other offering expensive debt to the poor, with the latter subsidizing the former. While balances are compounding at the highest average APR in decades, a brutal 21.5 percent, the haves are not just pulling away from the have-nots. The people swiping their cards to pay for food and gas are also paying for wealthy cardholders’ upgrades to business class.\n\nIn the credit-card industry, the well-to-do are known as transactors. They pay off their balance in full every month, avoiding late fees and interest charges. They use credit cards as a convenient payment method, and as a way to earn travel points, cash back, airport-lounge vouchers, seat upgrades, and other goodies. Given how valuable these rewards are, transactors make money by spending money. “If you’re spending $100,000 a year, you’re getting maybe $1,500 back in terms of points or cash,” Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution told me. “You’re not paying taxes on that. It’s worth closer to $2,500 or $3,000 a year in taxable income.” (That’s double the average worker’s weekly earnings.)\n\nJoe Pinsker: Against credit cards\n\nCredit-card companies compete intensely for transactors’ business, Klein explained. These customers rarely default. They rack up huge monthly charges, with firms such as Chase, Citi, American Express, and Capital One skimming a share of their spending. They travel often, allowing credit-card companies to make lucrative deals with airlines and hotel chains.\n\nIn contrast, the have-nots are known as revolvers. Revolvers are subprime borrowers who use credit cards as a payment tool and as a short-term loan, to cover surprise expenses and groceries the week before payday. Such customers tend to take out no-frills cards, without lavish cash-back rewards and travel points. They also tend to carry a balance from month to month, and sometimes from month to month to month to month.\n\n“When you talk to rich people who pay off their balance, they think that credit-card companies are losing money on them, and they’re the ones subsidizing the people who carry a balance,” Klein explained. “It’s the exact opposite.”\n\nRich families make out in two ways. First, the “swipe” or “interchange” fees that card networks and banks assess on retail businesses serve as a tax on poor families, who disproportionately pay with debit cards and cash. Most grocery stores and online shops charge their customers the same amount for an item, whether the customer pays with a debit card, cash, a credit card, a check, or a Venmo transfer. Accepting cash costs the retailer nothing. Accepting a debit card issued by a large bank costs it 0.05 percent, plus some change. Accepting a basic credit card costs perhaps 1.5 percent, and a fancy rewards card as much as 4 percent. In 2023, these swipe fees amounted to more than $224 billion, driving up retail prices by $1,700 a year for the average family. Everybody pays more for their goods; only fancy cardholders get juicy perks and cash returned to them.\n\nSecond, transactors benefit from the late fees and interest charges accumulated by revolvers, which credit-card companies use to help finance their rewards programs. This has proved particularly true in the past few years, as high prices and high interest rates have increased revolvers’ debt burdens.\n\nA strong economy with a brutal cost-of-living crisis is a great economy for the credit-card industry, it turns out. The average balance carried over month-to-month has risen; interest rates have risen; and card issuers have pushed their APRs far beyond prime rates. As a result, the revenue credit-card firms make from interest payments has ballooned from $76 billion in 2020 to $170 billion in 2024, and rewards cards have gotten more rewarding. The industry argues that swipe fees, not interest and penalties on poorer customers, finance its cash-back and travel programs, Ted Rossman of Bankrate, the financial data and news site, told me. But he does not “totally buy that.” It’s all “part of the calculation.”\n\nNow the economy seems to be slowing down: President Donald Trump’s trade war is increasing retail costs, uncertainty is leading businesses to pull back on investment, and firms are hiring fewer workers. Families are spending as much as they can afford, and struggling with mounting, expensive debt. “People take on credit-card debt for practical reasons,” Rossman told me. “That’s a tough cycle to break when the average interest rate is 20 percent.”\n\nGillian B. White: The unfair opacity of credit cards peddled to the poor\n\nRossman noted that high-income families were beginning to look more like working-class families in the credit-card data, with some transactors becoming revolvers. Three in five households credit-card debtors making more than $80,000 annually have been carrying a balance for more than a year, he said. Seriously delinquent balances are increasing, as is the share of loans that some card companies consider unrecoverable. Investors have noticed: The price of shares in American Express, Discover, Capital One, and other lending companies have dropped more than the broader market. Politicians have noticed too: A bipartisan House bill would cap credit-card interest rates at 10 percent, and a Senate proposal would lower swipe fees.\n\nThe legislation could help reduce borrowing costs and retail prices for millions of families, though Rossman noted that he expected credit-card issuers to raise fees to make up for the lost revenue. In the meantime, with markets swooning, card companies are offering fewer cards to subprime borrowers. This isn’t great news. Relying on expensive debt, and paying fees that subsidize richer card users, is bad enough for poor Americans. Not having a credit card to fall back on might be worse.",

        "content": "Want to stay current with Arthur’s writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.\n\nAs a younger man, I had an elderly family member who was, on the face of it, extremely kind and generous. Whenever she visited, she brought a thoughtful gift; she was always eager to have you over for your favorite meal; if you were sick, she would be at your bedside with chicken soup. But she had the strange habit of never accepting any favors from others. It was a source of pride for her, in fact. “I give, but don’t take,” she said. “Not even a glass of water.”\n\nAnd it was true: I never saw her accept a single kindness. Even in death, her generosity was a one-way valve. She left clear instructions that her body should be donated for medical science, and she would have no memorial service of any kind.\n\nThis is a pattern I have seen with some other people who pride themselves on their generosity, and perhaps you have too: all give, no take. One can only conclude that they think this practice adds to their virtuousness. But they’re wrong. An unwillingness or inability to accept kindnesses from others is a form of selfishness, because it appropriates for the giver all of the moral prestige of generosity while laying on the taker a sense of indebtedness, even obligation, that they have no way of paying off.\n\nThis makes giving a one-sided affair instead of what it is meant to be—a happiness-producing act of shared, mutual warmth. Learning how to receive gratefully from others is just as important, for your relationships and your own well-being, as being able to give generously.\n\nFrom the May 2015 issue: The man who couldn’t stop giving\n\nResearchers have demonstrated the happiness effects of kindness in novel ways. For example, in one experiment, participants were instructed to engage in random virtuous acts toward strangers, such as holding a door open, feeding a parking meter, or presenting them with a small gift. Then the recipient’s reaction was assessed for whether or not they displayed a “Duchenne smile,” a facial expression involving the zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi muscles (in the upper cheeks and around the eyes) that is known to signify authentic happiness. Compared with strangers who did not receive these kindnesses, those who did were almost four times more likely to display such a genuinely happy smile.\n\nThe recipients of kindness weren’t the only ones who got happier; the givers did too. Immediately after the experiment, these participants reported higher positive moods, joviality, gratitude, optimism, and life satisfaction than beforehand. This is consistent with many other studies: For example, psychologists in 2004 found that when students were assigned to engage in five minor acts of kindness and sacrifice a week, the practice reliably raised their overall happiness levels compared with students who did not engage in these acts.\n\nLogically, then, one way we can raise others’ well-being is by giving them opportunities to be kind and helpful. In a 2022 study in the journal Psychological Science, two researchers noted that people tend to be reluctant to ask a stranger for help—for example, asking to borrow their phone to make a call—because they assume this will inconvenience and annoy the person. However, as the scholars showed in their experiments, people who responded by helping proved more willing to assist, saw it as less trouble, and enjoyed more mood enhancement as a result than the asker had expected.\n\nSo one easy way to make someone happier is to accept their generosity, or even to ask them for a small favor. Indeed, some scholars believe that, because of the way this effect operates, the best way to get a big favor is by asking for a small one—to use a maxim quoted approvingly by Benjamin Franklin, “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.” If a potential employer asks whether you want a cup of coffee, the right answer is “I’d love one!” whether you drink coffee or not.\n\nBut beware the tipping point. There’s legitimate asking for help and then there’s outrageous presumption of generosity. Once, someone I liked but barely knew called to ask a “small favor”: Could his family come and live in my house for two weeks? Ask for too much like this, or ask too often, and in the eyes of your acquaintance you will go straight from Friendtown to Takerville. As scholars have noted, this is the point at which warmth turns to perceived exploitativeness. How you ask matters too. You should never demand something: Doing so is a mark of selfishness, which scholars have found among those who, without real justification, feel entitled or wronged.\n\nAnother way to spoil the warm glow that someone gets from doing you a kindness is by introducing extrinsic benefits, such as offering some kind of material quid pro quo. Imagine that I asked you to help me move a bunch of boxes out to my car. “Sure, happy to,” you might say—and mean it. Now, imagine I said, “If you help me take these boxes to my car, I’ll give you $4.” All the better, right? Of course not: You’d probably be appalled, feel insulted, and think I was an idiot. Favors should be just that—favors.\n\nFrom the September 1864 issue: Life and times of Benjamin Franklin\n\nAccepting kindnesses in a spirit of generosity promotes warm feelings between you and others. If this is hard for you, as it was for my elderly relative, a good place to start is simply to be alert to offers and resolve to accept them whenever possible. Obviously, this requires an ability to distinguish between true kindnesses and attempts at manipulation or coercion. You don’t have to agree to have dinner with a creep who you suspect has unsavory intentions. But “Can I grab you something from Starbucks?” is generally a good opportunity to say yes.\n\nYour next step can be to turn a small favor like that into a healthy social pattern by reciprocating. A culture of generosity is like the circulation of blood: It can’t stop in one particular location. If it does, it coagulates and no longer supports life. Saying yes to kindnesses but never offering to be the giver means that the favors and goodwill will in the end dry up. Instead, look for opportunities to let others accept your generosity. Tomorrow, you be the one who runs to the coffee shop.\n\nYou can start the cycle with others by asking for something most people love to give. Years ago, when I was running a large nonprofit, a wise person with many years’ experience in the industry observed that I was surrounded by donors who had been wildly successful as entrepreneurs but I never asked them for business advice, which I could very much have used. When I adopted the practice of asking more, it improved my management, friendships, and my fundraising. The lesson? People loved giving me advice: It made them feel great and, as researchers have shown, probably also made me appear more competent to them. Whenever you’re puzzled by a tricky circumstance in life, love, or work, think of someone who might have a helpful perspective and ask them to share it. (Note: Just because you ask for advice, or can gratefully accept it if offered unbidden, doesn’t mean you have to take it.)\n\nArthur C. Brooks: Love is medicine for fear\n\nOnce, in explaining the asking-as-giving principle to a class, a student stumped me by inquiring about how to apply it when someone appears to have truly nothing to give. A case that comes to mind is the homeless person who stops you on the street to ask for support or food: Is the dignity of giving simply unavailable to this person?\n\nI took this question home with me and rolled it around in my head, because I didn’t have a ready answer. Then later that night, it occurred to me what a homeless person could give that would have true value for me. At the next opportunity, I tried it out.\n\nAfter buying a man in the street food, before I turned to leave, I asked, “Will you, please, pray for me and my family?” His face initially registered shock at my request, but he readily agreed to it. I happen to believe, as many religions teach, that God hears the cries of the poor—so I consider that I got a great deal more than I gave that day. You don’t need to share my religious beliefs to understand, I’m sure, how the exchange gave me an opportunity to show the warm respect from accepting a kindness that every person needs and deserves.",

The secret of life is: Keep your eye on the ball.\n\nI’m borrowing that from a 1998 song by America’s sweetheart, Faith Hill, but if you don’t know the song, you still know that simple truth. You also know that to fail is to strike out; to fail valiantly is to go down swinging; to be surprised is to be thrown a curveball; to help a buddy out is to go to bat for him; and to succeed brilliantly is to knock one out of the park. And even if you haven’t seen A League of Their Own, or have somehow missed Jennifer Garner’s Capital One ads, you’ve probably heard the maxim “There’s no crying in baseball.”\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nIn January, I was standing in the locker room of George M. Steinbrenner Field, in Tampa, next to my teammates, whom I had met only the night before. When we heard the immortal words of Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, the aggrieved manager of the Rockford Peaches women’s baseball team, piping out of a nearby speaker, we recognized them and laughed. Then we clapped (or took out our phones for photos) as Len Milcowitz, the field coordinator and unofficial emcee of the weekend, emerged wearing a full Peaches uniform to drive home the point. He’d worn it in our honor, he said. “You represent the true spirit of baseball in this country, period,” he told us.\n\nBy that he meant that we were here only for the love of the game. As women, it was true, we could have no other motive, such as being signed by a team or even reliving high-school glory days. In fact, we had paid about $2,500 for the privilege. There were 87 of us, divided into six teams. This was the first full day of the 2025 Women’s Mini-Fantasy Camp, an annual event advertised with retro panache: “Ladies, opportunity is finally knocking and your chance to experience life as a New York Yankee is here.”\n\nThough many Major League Baseball teams host fantasy camps for men, only the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have offered them for women. This year’s camp was more immersive than usual. On top of receiving full uniforms (to keep!) and access to ice baths and physical therapists and real Yankees catering (memorably good pot roast), we were technically playing in a major-league stadium: The Tampa Bay Rays will be using the Yankees’ spring-training facility this year for their home games because Hurricane Milton took the roof off Tropicana Field.\n\nRead: Climate change comes for baseball\n\nOver the course of two days we would play 35 innings of baseball—five games of seven innings apiece, coached by former Yankees, whom camp employees referred to by the official title of “Legends.” I had several good reasons to be nervous. A friend had encouraged me to read George Plimpton’s 1961 book, Out of My League, which is about him pitching to major-league players at an All-Star exhibition game for a story in Sports Illustrated. I did read it, and that’s how I learned that Plimpton had been “a fanatic about pitching” while in school. I, in contrast, had never played baseball at all, despite being completely obsessed with watching it (at the stadium, on TV, on my phone while at work or at weddings). And I had not trained as much as I’d meant to in the weeks leading up to the camp—I’d gone to the batting cages a few times, played catch with my dad, and done several squats, but it was winter and it got dark at 4 p.m. It had been hard to work baseball into my days.\n\nThe other problem was that I don’t like the New York Yankees. When I signed up for the camp, I hadn’t thought this would be much of an issue. But then my favorite team, the New York Mets, signed the Yankees’ superstar Juan Soto out from under them, and my situation became politically sticky. When I tested a reveal of my Mets fandom to a friendly seeming woman on the shuttle bus to the opening dinner, she shushed me sharply, and for my own good.\n\nSo I kept quiet. And in this way, it was easy to get along with my assigned teammates, and it was easy to have a good time, even though our team name was the Pinstripes, which really rubbed the Yankees of it all right in a girl’s face. Our roster ranged in age from 24 to 70, and in experience from Division I softball to, well, me. Two women who’d gone to school together in New Jersey were there celebrating their 60th birthdays—Nina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, and Elizabeth Osder, who goes by Bitsy, a Los Angeles media executive who holds a place in baseball history. On April 21, 1974, she appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News when she became one of the first girls legally permitted to join a Little League baseball team, in New Jersey.\n\nPlayers stretch before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nEveryone was there for fun, and so was I, but I was also there because I wanted to briefly see a real-life staging of something that is still mostly a dream and that most people associate only with a 30-year-old Hollywood movie. There’s no crying in baseball, and there are no women in baseball either.\n\nSure, girls can play on Little League baseball teams, as Bitsy did, with boys. They can play on high-school baseball teams with boys. A scant few of them have even played on college baseball teams with boys. But they don’t get their own teams. There is no such thing as high-school or college baseball for women. There is no such thing as professional baseball for women, apart from a World Cup team that is assembled and disassembled every few years. Not only is this the baffling reality; it’s a baffling reality that hardly anybody talks about.\n\nFrom the September 2016 issue: Breaking into baseball’s ultimate boys’ club\n\nAfter the World Series ended in October, with nothing to look forward to but the long and empty months before the next baseball season, I settled in to watch Ken Burns’s 1994 documentary, Baseball, which is broken up into nine episodes. “There are only three things that America will be known for 2,000 years from now when they study this civilization,” the writer Gerald Early says in the first one. “The Constitution, jazz music, and baseball. They’re the three most beautifully designed things this culture has ever produced.” Well, women aren’t constrained in their enjoyment of jazz, or of the Constitution (for now), but …\n\nOver the nights that I spent being thoroughly entertained by the documentary, I nevertheless felt a pit in my stomach that got deeper and deeper. Burns very explicitly articulates the sport as being foundational to our culture and reflective of our society’s ideals. The game is democratic because it’s fair, egalitarian because it’s simple, and perfectly designed because its creators—energetic, imaginative people—arrived at the measurements for the diamond as if through divine inspiration. Baseball rewards commitment and reveals character; it loves rule-benders but judges cheaters. It has lofty goals and serious expectations, but it allows for theatricality and fun. It glorifies teamwork (double plays, rallies, sacrifices, and even sign-stealing are collaborative) but also reveres the hero (when a man comes up to bat, he comes up alone). It provides a convenient excuse to eat a hot dog.\n\nWomen play basketball, which is almost as old as baseball but has never carried the same level of cultural significance, and they play soccer, which is not predominantly an American game. They play hockey and lacrosse. They don’t play the vulgar, stupid sport of football, but nobody should. Yet they play basically everything else—every sport ever invented, even the weird ones. For no obvious or practical or logical reason, they are allowed to love, but almost never to play, baseball. They don’t get to play America’s game.\n\nActually, contrary to some of my sweeping statements, in baseball’s earliest days, women were eager to play and sometimes allowed to do so. Several women’s colleges had baseball teams in the mid-to-late 1800s—by 1875, Vassar had a number of them, including the Sure-Pops and the Daisy-Clippers. The all-Black, all-women Dolly Vardens barnstormed in the 1880s as some of the first documented professional women baseball players; their history, largely forgotten, has been revived by the historian Leslie Heaphy, a co-editor of 2006’s Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball (which she is updating).\n\nBut doctors were convinced, or so they said, that physical activity could render women infertile or even kill them. In 1867, a nationally syndicated newspaper story blamed baseball-playing for a young woman’s death from typhoid. One of the best-known baseball players in the country at the time, John Montgomery Ward, then of the New York Giants, wrote in his 1888 book, Base-Ball: How to Become a Player, “Base-ball in its mildest form is essentially a robust game, and it would require an elastic imagination to conceive of little girls possessed of physical powers such as its play demands.” When the game became big business at the turn of the 20th century, women were welcomed at the ballpark as spectators. Their presence was thought to help civilize the environs and increase the likelihood of entire families becoming fans and spending money on the sport. But that welcome didn’t extend to the diamond.\n\nFrom the May 1928 issue: Women aren’t fans\n\nA few months ago, I had a long call with the historian Jennifer Ring, the author of the 2009 book Stolen Bases: Why American Girls Don’t Play Baseball. We talked about her work for a while, and then we talked about how much we love baseball. For many years, she said, she’d felt alienated from the game and angry that her daughter, who was an excellent player, had run out of options and was forced to abandon the sport. “There was probably a decade of my life where I was just too pissed off to even watch baseball,” she said. But Ring grew up a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and she’d recently been roped back in by their World Series run and by the otherworldly superstar Shohei Ohtani. “I watched again this year, and it’s still the game I love,” she told me. “It’s brilliant. And the best players are just thrilling to watch.”\n\nOf course, hardly anyone resembles Ohtani, even in Major League Baseball. Mookie Betts, another Dodger great, is nothing like him. He’s seven inches shorter and at least 30 pounds lighter, and plays multiple defensive positions with charisma and flair. Ohtani, one of the best hitters and pitchers to have ever lived, is faintly aloof and carries himself woodenly (and has a fantastic head of hair). “It’s the people’s game because it calls for a variety of different kinds of body types and skills,” Ring pointed out. There are smaller and faster men in the middle infield; bigger guys at the corners; pitchers who look like Gumby dolls and pitchers who look like they belong to the Teamsters. All of this diversity gives the lie to the suggestion that women physically cannot play.\n\nBut this is a storied idea that has been repeated across generations. In the mid-1920s, the all-female Philadelphia Bobbies were completing a barnstorming tour of Japan, where they surprised journalists, impressed fans, and received celebrity treatment. Back home, girls were being encouraged to play a version of baseball, with a larger ball and a smaller field, that would be more suitable for them—a game variously known as kitten ball, playground ball, diamond ball, and mush ball, and originally invented in the winter months to be played by men, indoors. The game is now called softball. The details were laid out by Gladys E. Palmer in Baseball for Girls and Women, published in 1929. Palmer was an early advocate for girls’ athletics, but her attitudes were still of their time. She offered advice on how to throw properly (girls “do not have a natural aptitude for throwing, which all boys have from early childhood”) and discouraged girls and women from sliding. As Palmer acknowledged, the version of the game she promoted was meant to be “less strenuous.”\n\nMembers of the Rockford Peaches, 1944. The team was part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThat word, strenuous, comes up often. It was used by A. G. Spalding, an early baseball executive who also founded the country’s first sporting-goods empire, when he said that a woman was free to wave her handkerchief and root for the home team, but that “neither our wives, our sisters, our daughters, nor our sweethearts, may play Base Ball on the field … Base Ball is too strenuous for womankind.” The same word was used against the 17-year-old pitching phenom Jackie Mitchell, who was signed by the Minor League Chattanooga Lookouts (and who struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in a 1931 exhibition game). The baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, reportedly voided Mitchell’s contract, explaining that the baseball life was “too strenuous” for women.\n\nOne of my great loyalties, odd though it is for even me to contemplate, is to Brett Baty, a 25-year-old from Texas who was a first-round draft pick for the Mets in 2019 and was supposed to be their third baseman of the future. We have essentially nothing in common, obviously.\n\nBut something about his story has grabbed me. Baty hit a home run in his first major-league at-bat, in front of his family and against a hated division rival, but he’s never been able to string enough of those moments together. He has flashes of brilliance, and then he gets rattled by something. He starts making mistakes and looking bewildered. He loses his head. Then he goes down to the minors and plays with such dignity and grace. He wears the ugly promotional jerseys they make you wear at that level, and he hits some more home runs and learns a new defensive position in case that will help his chances of being called back up. Last year, his best friend, Mark Vientos, ended up taking the job that was supposed to be his and has excelled at it. In the playoffs, during which Vientos broke the Mets’ record for postseason runs batted in, the camera cut to Baty, watching from the dugout, whenever his friend did something great, and he was always, with no hesitation, ecstatic.\n\nThen, in the offseason, another insult and injury: His jersey number, 22, just happened to be the one that the superstar Juan Soto wanted, and the Mets reportedly had promised it to him in his $765 million contract. Soto may have gone through the ceremony of offering Baty a fancy present, such as a watch or a car, in exchange for the number, as players typically do in these situations, but it wasn’t immediately clear that he had. I took exception to this even though hardly anybody else—just a few other fans on social media—seemed to care. Are we not owed dignity even when we’re kind of a flop?\n\nThat’s a long way of explaining how my career as third baseman (baseperson?) for the Pinstripes began and ended. Though I had no experience, I reasoned that I was young and fairly coordinated, and I wanted to try my hand at the hot corner.\n\nOur first game was on one of the Yankees’ many practice fields, against another fantasy-camp team, the Bombers. When I walked out in my uniform, I felt like a ballplayer. I thought I’d watched enough of the game on television—almost every night for half of the year—to know what to do, at least basically. I quickly handled the first ball that a Bomber hit down the line to me, and I stood up with plenty of time to throw the runner out. But when I heaved the ball across the infield, it fell far short of the first baseman and way off line. The same thing happened with the next ball that came to me. And the next. My team was down by two runs at the end of the first inning.\n\nThen came my time to bat, which was my true fear. I had to be called back and reminded to put on a batting helmet. I panicked and momentarily forgot which side of the plate I was supposed to stand on. It came to me just in time, but I struck out on three pitches. Our coaches were throwing to us, and they were not trying to strike us out. They were “trying to hit your bats,” as they put it.\n\nThe author at bat, George M. Steinbrenner Field (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter this, I sat in the dugout and watched the other women watch the Yankees shortstop, Anthony Volpe, who was working out on a field behind us. (“He wasn’t very friendly,” one of them complained mildly, after admitting that she had more or less been catcalling him.) I moved to center field after a few more wild throws, and Kaley Sullivan, a 30-year-old police officer from California, took over third base. One ball slipped past her, and I scooped it up and threw it back to her; she stepped on the base and made the out. This was a highlight of my life, but in my next at-bat, I managed only two foul tips before striking out again. We lost the game 9–4 and mollified ourselves by saying we would work out the kinks in the afternoon.\n\nAt lunch, I sat next to Leslie Konsig, a 42-year-old insurance representative and plainly the best athlete on our team, who had been making plays at shortstop as reliably as I had seen the guys do it on TV. It was difficult to look anywhere other than at her on the field. She wore her dark hair in a single braid, smiled easily at everyone, and moved with the ease that comes with total competence. She treated us all like real ballplayers—meaning she was a bit more specific and direct at times than our actual coaches.\n\nLeslie was there with her friend Lainey Archenault, 43, an animated woman with a strong Jersey accent. They are both moms, and they play together on a New Jersey softball team called the Sluggers; Lainey conspired with Leslie’s wife to sign her up for the camp as a surprise. Lainey, I learned, is a die-hard Yankees fan who has been watching almost every single game for as long as she can remember. She clocked immediately that I’d chosen the jersey number 0 in reference to the somewhat random relief pitcher Adam Ottavino, who grew up in Brooklyn near where I live and who played for the Yankees in 2019 and 2020. (More recently, he played for the Mets.) Though she has coached her son’s 10-and-under travel baseball team, this was the first time she’d played a game of baseball instead of softball. Growing up, she told me, she’d been obsessed with Don Mattingly—she was left-handed, as he is, so she’d hoped to be a first baseman, as he was. But she’s petite, so that wasn’t in the cards. Instead, she was put in the outfield, which she now prefers, because you get to watch a whole game unfold in front of you.\n\nBy contrast, Leslie didn’t care much about the Yankees. She was wearing the number 22 and had no idea that it was a sore spot for Yankees fans who were mourning Soto’s betrayal. “I’m more here to play,” she told me. “To feel, like, what it is to be on the field, wear these uniforms, use the amenities.” She’d been the only girl on her Little League team, and she’d played until high school, when she had to switch to softball. But Leslie still had a Yankees-fan story: She’d gone to the 1996 World Series with her dad and his friends, and they were so overcome by giddiness that they’d even included her, at age 14, in the celebratory cigars.\n\nThis set off some table-wide chatter about the most recent World Series, which the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in somewhat humiliating fashion, capped off by a disastrous error-riddled inning that saw a five-run lead evaporate in the decisive Game 5. “We played better than they did, today,” Bitsy Osder said.\n\nHigh on camaraderie, I went into the afternoon games confident that I could improve my performance. For the second game, we were on the main field—an intimidating change of venue, as this meant music blaring over the loudspeakers while we warmed up, use of the giant scoreboard, and an announcer to read off our names as we went up to bat.\n\nWe were quickly down by three, but my teammates rallied for five runs in the fourth inning, and we ended up winning 7–3. The rally was exhilarating—I was Brett Baty in the dugout. Again, I contributed no hits. I had been dropped to the bottom of the batting order. But I pinch-ran for a teammate and accepted my status as role player. This time, at least, I hit a grounder and was thrown out, rather than just flailing at the plate.\n\nBefore our third and final game of the day, back on the practice fields, we got a pep talk. One of our coaches, or Legends, was Ray Burris, a journeyman pitcher who played with the Yankees in 1979. (At dinner, he let us each hold the American League Championship ring he’d been awarded in 2012 as a pitching coach in the Detroit Tigers organization.) He sat us down and said: “You’re as good as your last game, and you’re as bad as your first game.” We were not to get big heads.\n\nIn the third game, we scored four in the top of the first, but the other team, the Captains, scored five in the bottom. I misplayed a ball in the outfield and then stepped on it, shooting it into foul territory, where it skidded away across the dirt. I made a base-running error (as a pinch runner) and I twisted myself up underneath a fly ball and felt my back wrench as it dropped behind me.\n\nThen Leslie hit an inside-the-park home run—assisted by two, or possibly four, defensive errors by the other team—and we went wild. But the Captains rallied again in the bottom of the sixth for another five runs and then we were down again, 10–6. My teammates worked a gritty top of the seventh, in our final chance to score. They brought in two runs, making it 10–8. I stared at the lineup card in horror as what was about to happen came together in my mind: I was going to be the last woman up. Two outs, bases loaded. If I hit the ball, we could tie the game—or even win, if there were two, or possibly four, defensive errors.\n\nI swung at the first pitch and missed. I let the second pitch go by—ball. I swung and missed at a third pitch. I could feel humiliation a breath away. Then I nicked a foul ball. I could hardly believe the moment was still happening. Then, on the next pitch, I heard what was not quite a crack but was still the perfect sound of bat on ball. We were playing with wooden bats, not the metal ones they have at batting cages, which sound tinny and awful and jangle your hands. I ran in a dead sprint, made it to first base, and didn’t see the ball anywhere. I was safe!\n\nBut then I turned around and saw that the pitcher had fielded the ball, which had been nothing more than an infield roller, and had thrown it to the catcher for the force play at home.\n\nI’d made the last out and the game was over.\n\nIn the early ’70s, several Major League teams hosted Hot Pants Days, which offered free admission to women who came to the stadium wearing short-shorts. Also at that time, Little League teams that allowed girls to play could be threatened with revocation of their charters.\n\nMaria Pepe grew up in an apartment complex in Hoboken, New Jersey, that was full of children, mostly boys. Whenever she was done with her homework, she would join them in playing slap ball, stickball, Wiffle ball, and any other variation of baseball they could make work. “From a young age, maybe 7 years old, I just started playing, and I loved it,” she told me. In 1972, she tried out for Little League and made the Young Democrats team. She pitched three games before angry parents reported her team to Little League’s national office; the league threatened to take away the charter that covered all Hoboken teams, so Pepe’s coach came over to her house and took back her uniform. He let her keep her cap.\n\nThe National Organization for Women picked up her case in the spring of 1972, filing a complaint with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights. This caused a big to-do, and newspapers and radio followed the case closely, though Pepe’s parents helped her tune a lot of it out. She did vaguely know that a court was hearing arguments regarding the density of her bones as compared with boys’ bones, presented by Creighton J. Hale, Little League’s executive vice president and director of research. (This argument was based on a Japanese study of cadavers and another about skiing accidents, both of which included only adult bones.) Hale also presented a hypothesis that being hit by a ball could cause breast cancer in girls. Little League’s other arguments were impressively circular. One was that there was no sense in allowing girls to play baseball, because they would not have future opportunities to play it professionally. Another was that the Little League national charter, which specified its purpose as developing “qualities of citizenship, sportsmanship, and manhood,” would be contradicted by the inclusion of girls.\n\nNina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, hustles to first. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nJudge Sylvia Pressler found these arguments uncompelling. “Little League is as American as hot dogs and apple pie,” she wrote in her ruling. There was no good reason why “that piece of public Americana should be withheld from girls.” Little League did not acquiesce easily. The organization filed an appeal, which it lost. But by this time, Pepe was too old to play.\n\nMy teammate Bitsy said that Pepe “took the arrows” for her. Bitsy was one of the first sign-ups, and so news of her first game for the Englewood Orioles was printed in papers across the country. She struck out in her first at-bat, but then drew a walk and scored a run. She was described by the Daily News as “all mouth,” challenging the umpires and instructing her teammates on what to do. She jokes that she thinks her fly was open in one of the newspaper photos.\n\nNow easing into retirement, Bitsy plays in two L.A. leagues just for fun. Like many young kids, she fantasized about playing for the New York Yankees. “By the grace of Maria Pepe and the New Jersey Supreme Court,” she told me, “I was able to sustain that fantasy a little longer.” She considers her Little League experience a blessing. She was accepted by her teammates and she had a blast. “I am a very positive, glass-half-full person,” she told me. “I just think my whole outlook in life would have been different if they had said no to me.”\n\nFor the past 50 years, Little League hasn’t said no to girls who love baseball, but it has set them up to be a minority. Instead of encouraging girls to play baseball after the court decision, Little League encouraged softball for girls and made that their primary option. This example was followed by high schools and colleges, which offer only softball teams for girls and young women. And even if you’re good enough to play with the boys in high school, how do you stick it out, knowing that you could get a college scholarship for softball if you switched?\n\n“Anybody who knows the two games knows they are not equivalent,” Leslie Heaphy, the historian, told me. Softball has a bigger ball and underhand pitching, as well as a smaller diamond, a closer fence, and a different style of play that is both faster and simpler. Both are great games, but our culture has accepted a false equivalency, she argued. It’s “just a way of never having to address the issue that women want to play baseball [and] should be allowed to. It should be open to anybody.”\n\nJennifer Ring pointed out that the number of girls playing on boys’ high-school baseball teams hasn’t changed for decades—it hovers between 1,000 and 2,000 out of a total of nearly half a million. In recent years, Little League has held events to honor “Girls With Game,” as they call girls who play baseball or softball. But when I wrote to ask how many girls currently play baseball in Little League International, Kevin Fountain, the organization’s senior director of communications, wrote back to say that the information wasn’t available. He could only say that 32 percent of Little League participants—across baseball and softball—are female.\n\nThinking it might be a matter of a statistic being difficult to calculate for some reason, I wrote back and asked for a couple of alternatives. Could he tell me how many baseball teams have girls on them? Could he tell me whether any Little League baseball teams are girls-only? He could not.\n\nIn an earlier email, he’d sent me a link to an article about the Maria Pepe Little League Baseball Legacy Series, which was played for the first time in 2024, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I noticed that the visiting girls stayed in dorms in the Dr. Creighton J. Hale International Grove—a complex named for the man who’d once argued that they would ruin the sport if they ever picked up a bat. He eventually regretted this position, and when he met Pepe later in life, he told her that his granddaughter had begun playing ball.\n\nThroughout the weekend, I had several conversations with women about a new Women’s Pro Baseball League, which was announced in October and is set to debut in 2026. “If it’s within driving distance, I’m going to every game,” Vicky Leone, a retired 58-year-old mother of two, told me.\n\nVicky was a regular at the camp—one of its pillars. Her team, the Bombers, which went undefeated over the weekend, was largely made up of women who had been playing together for years. When I ran into her at dinner one night, she was wearing a onesie covered in the face of her team’s coach, the former Yankees second baseman Homer Bush. She told me that in 2017, during her third year at the camp, she’d asked one of the Legends, Orlando Hernández, a former Yankees pitcher otherwise known as El Duque, to throw her a real fastball. She has no idea how fast he threw it, but she somehow made contact, and hit it out of George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\n“I guess I timed it just right,” Vicky told me. “I didn’t even realize it went over the fence.” A player on the opposing team had to yell at her to stop sprinting as she rounded second, and when she got back to the dugout, her own teammates were losing their minds. A camp employee went and found the ball, and Hernández signed it for her. She still doesn’t know how it happened—“the baseball gods” intervened.\n\nVicky plays in three different softball leagues all year round, but playing baseball at camp for one weekend a year is important to her. “We’re like a sisterhood,” she said. Her teammates, many of whom are roughly her age, are all part of a generation of women who were snubbed by baseball. She grew up wanting to play and would often be dismissed with an Isn’t that cute? When she got older, she would talk about baseball, and boys would ignore her. When she started coaching baseball, parents didn’t want their sons to be assigned to her team.\n\nThe author loosens up before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nNow she sees girls playing in the Little League World Series and has heard about the professional women’s league starting next year. “Sometimes I feel—I wish I was born now and not then, just so I could be a part of that.” But she has more enthusiasm than regret. “I would love to be a coach there, even an assistant coach, keeping book, whatever; I would love to do that,” she told me. “Am I going to? Probably not. But, you know, it’s a dream, and everybody’s got a dream.”\n\nThe idea for the Women’s Pro Baseball League was announced with a bare-bones press release. It revealed that the league would start next year with six teams “predominantly in the Northeast,” and that it had been co-founded by a lawyer, Keith Stein, alongside Justine Siegal, a well-known figure in the world of women’s baseball. Siegal grew up playing and then became a coach. She’s best known as the first woman to have pitched a major-league batting practice and for creating the nonprofit Baseball for All, which promotes girls’ participation in the sport.\n\nJemele Hill: Women’s college basketball is a worthy investment\n\n“My whole life has been about getting girls involved in baseball,” Siegal told me when we spoke in December. She is a co-owner of the new league, in charge of baseball operations, and will likely be its first commissioner. She rattled off part of her to-do list: The WPBL will need scouts, tryouts, contracts, stadiums. It will need to create a culture of girls’ baseball from scratch. And so, most important, it will need time and serious backing. Even with the patronage of the NBA, it took decades for the WNBA to reach the levels of interest it has today. The Professional Women’s Hockey League, which also started with six teams just last year, is wholly owned by the chairman of the Dodgers and his wife; they can afford to wait while it finds its footing. A new baseball league will similarly need team owners who are able to front huge costs and are willing to commit to something that might not be profitable for the foreseeable future.\n\nSiegal described her vision for the league by comparing it to Angel City FC, the women’s soccer team in Los Angeles. The fan base isn’t enormous, but it’s big enough. “The place is packed; it’s electric. And the athletes are being treated well, making money. They don’t need a second job. And girls know that it’s possible that they, too, could become a professional player.”\n\nThe only real precedent for a women’s baseball league is the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the subject of A League of Their Own. The league was created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley in 1943 to keep baseball alive as an entertainment industry while many of its brightest stars went to fight in World War II. He was initially the sole owner of the entire league, which was based in the Midwest and rostered only white women.\n\nThe Racine Belles and South Bend Blue Sox, both of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, face off in 1947. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThe league gave hundreds of women the opportunity to play baseball, and it put on some great games that impressed even seasoned baseball professionals and sportswriters. But there was always a tension, as depicted in the movie, between the gimmick and the game. The league had strict rules about feminine appearance and behavior—players wore skirts, went to charm school, and were taught to scratch at bars of soap to remove the dirt under their fingernails. The league was disbanded in 1954, and the idea was largely forgotten until the release of A League of Their Own.\n\nThe movie inspired a very brief period of trial and error. A women’s league based on the West Coast played a season and a half before its owner pulled the plug over low attendance, and the Coors Brewing Company sponsored the Colorado Silver Bullets, a barnstorming team managed by the beloved knuckleball pitcher Phil Niekro. “Give them the time all the men have had in this country to play, and you’re going to find a lot of good baseball players,” Niekro told The New York Times after the team’s first year (they went 6–38). The Bullets put on some great games and improved to a winning record in their fourth year. But marketing stunts are not meant for longevity and the Bullets, too, did not last.\n\nThe U.S. does have a national women’s baseball team, which was featured in the 2024 documentary See Her Be Her. That team competes every two to three years in a Women’s Baseball World Cup, which the U.S. last won in 2006; Japan, which dominates in women’s baseball, has been the champion in the past seven contests. Americans are far behind.\n\nSee Her Be Her, which aired on the MLB Network the week of the World Series, demonstrated the support that women’s baseball has been able to garner among former major-league stars, including Ichiro Suzuki and Cal Ripken Jr. Ripken, whose 21-year playing career with the Baltimore Orioles ended in 2001, is a member of one of the most famous baseball families in American history. During his own Hall of Fame career, he played alongside his brother Billy and was managed by his father, Cal Ripken Sr. His sister, Ellie, never got to play, though he describes her as throwing harder than he did as a child and growing into a massively talented athlete in other sports.\n\nRipken told me that he and his teammates had watched the Silver Bullets play exhibition games. “I always looked out there and saw my sister and thought, Wouldn’t my sister love to do this? ” I didn’t sense that he was putting on a show—more like it was flatly obvious to someone whose whole life is baseball that everyone should get a chance to enjoy playing it. “I wouldn’t say we were surprised, but our eyes would open, saying, ‘Man, these girls are really good,’ ” he said. “To try to figure out why that didn’t blossom at that time—sometimes they say good ideas, it’s a matter of timing. Maybe this is the right timing now.”\n\nOn Saturday morning at baseball camp, my beautiful Pinstripes took the lead quickly in our first game, which we won 6–2; again, I did not contribute a single hit.\n\nMy worst fear was realized as my teammates began to notice—or, probably, they had already noticed, and it just became impossible for them to credibly ignore—that I was by far the worst baseball player on our team. This inspired them to acts of kindness, such as high fives when I had done nothing to earn them and vociferous cheering whenever I was at the plate.\n\nIn the buffet line at lunch, Ray, our coach, tried to get at the root of my problem, which he diagnosed as mental. I told him about Brett Baty and his many struggles, and though he clearly had no idea who I was talking about or why I was so fixated on him, he seemed to agree that Baty and I had a similar problem, and it was in our brains. “What are you thinking when you’re up there?” he asked me. “I’m thinking, I hope I don’t miss the ball, ” I told him in the spirit of honesty, even though I was already 100 percent sure that this was not the correct thing to be thinking. Ray kindly told me that this was not the correct thing to be thinking.\n\nI never wanted to be a baseball player and my performance at baseball camp doesn’t matter. These games, however, were meaningful to women who, by playing them, were making peace with their childhood fantasies after many, many years. One such person was my teammate Susie McNamara, who at 53 years old was attending her third camp. One evening, she told me that she was doing so this time to mark the end of chemo treatments, which she’d finished two months prior. But the first time she came, in 2011, she’d wanted to prove something.\n\nSusie grew up in a baseball family. Her grandfather played for the Yankees’ farm team the Newark Bears. Her father was a police officer but also owned a baseball-card shop in Lambertville, New Jersey. He convinced everyone that it would be safe for her to start playing T-ball when she was 4 years old, and, later, that she could play Little League baseball with the boys. She was teased in school, she remembered, for wearing a baseball cap all the time (“It wasn’t, like, a fashion statement,” the way it is now) and for dreaming of being a Yankee.\n\nShe had to give that up when she was 12, and her primary option was softball. She would go on to play for Mount St. Mary’s, a Division I school in Maryland, but the coaching was terrible and the experience was miserable. Her sophomore year, the team’s record was one win, 31 losses. “I bet that one felt really good, though,” I suggested, but I was wrong. “That one broke my heart,” she said.\n\nWhen she showed up at camp the first time, she thought of it as her opportunity to demonstrate what she could do. The Legends that year included one of her heroes, Bucky Dent, who stopped and stared theatrically when she made an impressive play at third base. She also remembers Darryl Strawberry standing over her after she made a diving backhanded catch in foul territory and screaming, “That was outstanding!” She thought that weekend was probably the best she’d ever played in her life.\n\nIn our final game, against the Bambinos, the Pinstripes were on fire. The other women had perfected the team’s defense over the course of the weekend—it didn’t hurt that I didn’t touch the ball once—and the only thing left for us to accomplish was a hit from me. I was not the only one who felt this way. Others said it, including Leslie, who told me, “I’m committed to you getting a hit.” (And Lainey, who said, “Let’s go, Ottavino!”)\n\nIn my first at-bat, I swung on the first pitch and something happened. The ball dribbled up the first-base line and the first baseman scooped it up easily, tagging me as I passed. But a run scored! No hits, but one RBI!\n\nThe Pinstripes celebrate a victory in their last game of the weekend. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter taking the lead in that inning, we were winning for the entire game, so the pressure on me—from that angle—was quite low. In my second at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me on every pitch. I hit the ball just foul down the first-base line, felt a momentary jolt of hope because of the hard contact, and then struck out. In my third and final at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me again, and I struck out again. “Next year!” I announced, in a voice that was supposed to be playful and make everybody feel less awkward, but actually sounded childish and a bit unhinged.\n\nIt was ridiculous how upset I was. I was shocked at myself. I hadn’t been expecting it, but the admonition of “no crying in baseball” became suddenly relevant—I had to duck into the tunnel for a few seconds to regain my composure. My teammates, who were geniuses, politely ignored me for five minutes. And then our careers as New York Yankees were over. We had won our final game and went home with a record of three wins and two losses, which you might notice is a .600 winning percentage, higher than that of the actual Yankees last year. We drank Miller Lite in the locker room and swapped phone numbers.\n\nI texted my college roommate from Staten Island that I would mail her all the Yankees merchandise that had been included in the price of admission. I texted my boyfriend that I had a new appreciation for the game and was humbled. I texted my dad, “One RBI!” There’s no crying in baseball, and the other thing they’re always saying is that baseball is a game of failure. If you have a really good batting average, you’re failing about 70 percent of the time. Most women, like most men who try the game of baseball, aren’t up to it. They crumble, like me, and like Brett Baty has in the past, though I am confident he will not do so this year.\n\nAt the start of her book, Jennifer Ring mentions the Burns baseball documentary, noting that it is more than 18 hours long but spends just a few minutes on women playing baseball in the 1800s, and then another few on the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and ’50s.\n\nThis is particularly strange because the episode about the ’60s and ’70s touches on other issues of the day—Vietnam, civil rights, social unrest—but makes no mention of NOW’s involvement in the Little League legal battle, which would seem to fit in fairly naturally. Baseball is the definitive story of the game in this country, which is why Ring brings it up. “He’s including it in his history, but he’s giving it the position that he thinks it deserves.”\n\nBaseball is for the fastidious—a game in which everything matters. Reflecting in 1981 on the past 50 years of his life as a fan, Roger Angell wrote: “All of us who have followed the game with intensity have found ourselves transformed into walking memory banks, humming with games won, games lost, batting averages and earned-run averages, games started and games saved, ‘magic numbers,’ final standings, lifetime marks, Series, seasons, decades, epochs.”\n\nEvery play is recorded. Every pitch is remembered. It all counts. Every mistake. Every miracle. You can hear the delight and shock in an announcer’s voice when they see something that has somehow never happened before in the history of millions of plays. If you watch enough baseball, you can just feel when something is really something. (Baty’s three-run homer at Tropicana Field, which disappeared into the late, great ceiling and never came down?) In a game in which everything matters, in which we who love it wish to see every possible outcome unfold, how can we stomach the absence of women’s baseball?",

Find The Atlantic’s search tool for movie and television writing used to train AI here.\n\nWhen employees at Meta started developing their flagship AI model, Llama 3, they faced a simple ethical question. The program would need to be trained on a huge amount of high-quality writing to be competitive with products such as ChatGPT, and acquiring all of that text legally could take time. Should they just pirate it instead?\n\nMeta employees spoke with multiple companies about licensing books and research papers, but they weren’t thrilled with their options. This “seems unreasonably expensive,” wrote one research scientist on an internal company chat, in reference to one potential deal, according to court records. A Llama-team senior manager added that this would also be an “incredibly slow” process: “They take like 4+ weeks to deliver data.” In a message found in another legal filing, a director of engineering noted another downside to this approach: “The problem is that people don’t realize that if we license one single book, we won’t be able to lean into fair use strategy,” a reference to a possible legal defense for using copyrighted books to train AI.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nCourt documents released last night show that the senior manager felt it was “really important for [Meta] to get books ASAP,” as “books are actually more important than web data.” Meta employees turned their attention to Library Genesis, or LibGen, one of the largest of the pirated libraries that circulate online. It currently contains more than 7.5 million books and 81 million research papers. Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from “MZ”—an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—to download and use the data set.\n\nThis act, along with other information outlined and quoted here, recently became a matter of public record when some of Meta’s internal communications were unsealed as part of a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought against the company by Sarah Silverman, Junot Díaz, and other authors of books in LibGen. Also revealed recently, in another lawsuit brought by a similar group of authors, is that OpenAI has used LibGen in the past. (A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation against the company. OpenAI did not return a request for comment.)\n\nUntil now, most people have had no window into the contents of this library, even though they have likely been exposed to generative-AI products that use it; according to Zuckerberg, the “Meta AI” assistant has been used by hundreds of millions of people (it’s embedded in Meta products such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram). To show the kind of work that has been used by Meta and OpenAI, I accessed a snapshot of LibGen’s metadata—revealing the contents of the library without downloading or distributing the books or research papers themselves—and used it to create an interactive database that you can search here:\n\nThere are some important caveats to keep in mind. Knowing exactly which parts of LibGen that Meta and OpenAI used to train their models, and which parts they might have decided to exclude, is impossible. Also, the database is constantly growing. My snapshot of LibGen was taken in January 2025, more than a year after it was accessed by Meta, according to the lawsuit, so some titles here wouldn’t have been available to download at that point.\n\nLibGen’s metadata are quite disorganized. There are errors throughout. Although I have cleaned up the data in various ways, LibGen is too large and error-strewn to easily fix everything. Nevertheless, the database offers a sense of the sheer scale of pirated material available to models trained on LibGen. Cujo, The Gulag Archipelago, multiple works by Joan Didion translated into several languages, an academic paper named “Surviving a Cyberapocalypse”—it’s all in here, along with millions of other works that AI companies could feed into their models.\n\nMeta and OpenAI have both argued in court that it’s “fair use” to train their generative-AI models on copyrighted work without a license, because LLMs “transform” the original material into new work. The defense raises thorny questions and is likely a long way from resolution. But the use of LibGen raises another issue. Bulk downloading is often done with BitTorrent, the file-sharing protocol popular with pirates for its anonymity, and downloading with BitTorrent typically involves uploading to other users simultaneously. Internal communications show employees saying that Meta did indeed torrent LibGen, which means that Meta could have not only accessed pirated material but also distributed it to others—well established as illegal under copyright law, regardless of what the courts determine about the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI. (Meta has claimed that it “took precautions not to ‘seed’ any downloaded files” and that there are “no facts to show” that it distributed the books to others.) OpenAI’s download method is not yet known.\n\nMeta employees acknowledged in their internal communications that training Llama on LibGen presented a “medium-high legal risk,” and discussed a variety of “mitigations” to mask their activity. One employee recommended that developers “remove data clearly marked as pirated/stolen” and “do not externally cite the use of any training data including LibGen.” Another discussed removing any line containing ISBN, Copyright, ©, All rights reserved. A Llama-team senior manager suggested fine-tuning Llama to “refuse to answer queries like: ‘reproduce the first three pages of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.”’” One employee remarked that “torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right.”\n\nIt is easy to see why LibGen appeals to generative-AI companies, whose products require huge quantities of text. LibGen is enormous, many times larger than Books3, another pirated book collection whose contents I revealed in 2023. Other works in LibGen include recent literature and nonfiction by prominent authors such as Sally Rooney, Percival Everett, Hua Hsu, Jonathan Haidt, and Rachel Khong, and articles from top academic journals such as Nature, Science, and The Lancet. It includes many millions of articles from top academic-journal publishers such as Elsevier and Sage Publications.\n\nRead: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and tech\n\nLibGen was created around 2008 by scientists in Russia. As one LibGen administrator has written, the collection exists to serve people in “Africa, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, China, Russia and post-USSR etc., and on a separate note, people who do not belong to academia.” Over the years, the collection has ballooned as contributors piled in more and more pirated work. Initially, most of LibGen was in Russian, but English-language work quickly came to dominate the collection. LibGen has grown so quickly and avoided being shut down by authorities thanks in part to its method of dissemination. Whereas some other libraries are hosted in a single location and require a password to access, LibGen is shared in different versions by different people via peer-to-peer networks.\n\nMany in the academic world have argued that publishers have brought this type of piracy on themselves, by making it unnecessarily difficult and expensive to access research. Sci-Hub, a sibling of LibGen, was launched independently in 2011 by a Kazakhstani neuroscience student named Alexandra Elbakyan, whose university didn’t provide access to the big academic databases. In that same year, the hacktivist Aaron Swartz was arrested after taking millions of articles from JSTOR in an attempt to build a similar kind of library.\n\nPublishers have tried to stop the spread of pirated material. In 2015, the academic publisher Elsevier filed a complaint against LibGen, Sci-Hub, other sites, and Elbakyan personally. The court granted an injunction, directed the sites to shut down, and ordered Sci-Hub to pay Elsevier $15 million in damages. Yet the sites remained up, and the fines went unpaid. A similar story played out in 2023, when a group of educational and professional publishers, including Macmillan Learning and McGraw Hill, sued LibGen. This time the court ordered LibGen to pay $30 million in damages, in what TorrentFreak called “one of the broadest anti-piracy injunctions we’ve seen from a U.S. court.” But that fine also went unpaid, and so far authorities have been largely unable to constrain the spread of these libraries online. Seventeen years after its creation, LibGen continues to grow.\n\nRead: There’s no longer any doubt that Hollywood writing is powering AI\n\nAll of this certainly makes knowledge and literature more accessible, but it relies entirely on the people who create that knowledge and literature in the first place—that labor that takes time, expertise, and often money. Worse, generative-AI chatbots are presented as oracles that have “learned” from their training data and often don’t cite sources (or cite imaginary sources). This decontextualizes knowledge, prevents humans from collaborating, and makes it harder for writers and researchers to build a reputation and engage in healthy intellectual debate. Generative-AI companies say that their chatbots will themselves make scientific advancements, but those claims are purely hypothetical.\n\nOne of the biggest questions of the digital age is how to manage the flow of knowledge and creative work in a way that benefits society the most. LibGen and other such pirated libraries make information more accessible, allowing people to read original work without paying for it. Yet generative-AI companies such as Meta have gone a step further: Their goal is to absorb the work into profitable technology products that compete with the originals. Will these be better for society than the human dialogue they are already starting to replace?",

        "title": "What the Press Got Wrong About Hitler",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "One of the greatest journalistic misapprehensions of all time was made by one of the greatest journalists of all time. In December 1931, the legendary American reporter Dorothy Thompson secured an interview with Adolf Hitler, whose National Socialist party had recently surged in the polls, bringing him from the fringe of German politics to the cusp of political power.\n\n“When I walked into Adolf Hitler’s room, I was convinced that I was meeting the future dictator of Germany,” Thompson recalled afterward. “In something like 50 seconds, I was quite sure he was not. It took just about that time to measure the startling insignificance of this man who has set the world agog.” Within a year, Hitler was chancellor.\n\nWe have come to view Hitler’s path to the chancellorship, and ultimately to dictatorship, as inexorable, and Hitler himself as a demonic force of human nature who defied every law of political gravity—not as the man of “startling insignificance” Thompson encountered in the second-floor corner office of the Brown House, the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich, that day. But Thompson was hardly alone in her assessment. Much of the German press, most international correspondents, and many political observers—along with a majority of ordinary Germans—drew similar conclusions about the Nazi leader. Which brings up the question: How did so many reporters and other contemporary observers get Hitler so wrong?\n\nFew public figures have provided as easy a target for ridicule and disparagement as Adolf Hitler. He was a high-school dropout, a failed artist, and a frontline soldier who never made it beyond the rank of corporal. He was a rabid anti-Semite who did not himself possess the Aryan credentials he demanded of his followers. His father had changed the family name from Schickelgruber. “Heil Schickelgruber!” was a running joke in the Weimar years. But even the name Hitler was cause for ridicule. Hitler can be translated as “man from the hut” and appears in various iterations: Hiedler, Hietler, Hüttler, Hittler, all of which convey a sense of quaint southern rusticism, especially to the north-German ear. “Hüttler? Hüttler?” the left-wing newspaper Vorwärts wrote in December 1932, spoofing Hitler’s name. “It sounds so funny.”\n\nEven in Bavaria, where Hitler had launched his political career, he was more disdained than feared. In March 1922, when Hitler was circulating on the right-wing fringe of Munich’s beer-hall political scene, Bavaria’s state interior minister considered deporting him to his native Austria, only to be allegedly told by a Social Democratic colleague that the National Socialist leader was a “comical figure” who would soon “be hurtled back into the insignificance from which he originally came.”\n\nTo run for political office in Germany, Hitler needed to obtain German citizenship. His repeated attempts to do this were subjected to public ridicule. In 1930, after the Bavarians refused Hitler citizenship because of his felony conviction for his failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, the first National Socialist to secure a senior post in government, arranged for Hitler to be appointed to a position that automatically conferred German citizenship—police commissioner in the little Thuringian village of Hildburghausen. Hitler traveled to this hinterland village, swore an oath, and signed an affidavit before recognizing, belatedly, the paltry nature of the position. Returning to Munich, Hitler burned his appointment papers and instructed Frick to do the same. But by then it was too late—journalists had gotten wind of this.\n\nThe opposition press had a field day. Hitler was hailed as the “Gendarme of Hildburghausen.” “We do not wish to disparage the honorable position of a gendarmerie commissioner,” the Berlin newspaper Vossische Zeitung editorialized, “but the absurdity lies in the outspoken peacock vanity of the ruler of the Brown House, as if he really wanted to command seven gendarmes and three police officers.” It got worse: “As of yesterday, all of Europe is laughing about Adolf Hitler,” reported Tempo, another Berlin paper. And the laughter wasn’t coming just from Europe: “The whole world is laughing about Gendarme Hitler,” the Social Democratic newspaper Das Volk reported. As The New York Times summed things up, Hitler’s fumbling attempt at this backwoods path to German citizenship and political power had generated “more merriment than indignation in political circles.”\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: The oligarchs who came to regret supporting Hitler\n\nHitler’s second attempt at securing German citizenship was also facilitated by Wilhelm Frick. This effort—being appointed a mid-level civil servant in the state of Braunschweig—was successfully consummated, but it turned farcical nonetheless. As Hitler entered the room in Braunschweig where he was to take his oath of office, he reportedly tripped on the carpet, leaving his entourage frozen awkwardly in stiff-armed Nazi salutes while he stumbled headlong into the room. One observer compared it to “Napoleon appearing on the world stage in his underwear.” The newspaper Germania saw the scene as a “constitutional comedy” ready-made for the theater.\n\n“Hitler Appointed Civil Servant,” declared the headline of a Vorwärts article, which noted that if Hitler failed in his electoral bid for the presidency, he could safely withdraw to Braunschweig, with his annual salary of 5,238 Reichmarks (about $27,350 today), and serve out his time as a “diligent” public servant until his mandatory retirement, at age 65, in 1954.\n\nHitler acquired German citizenship on Friday, February 26, 1932. The following day he announced his candidacy for president, setting the stage for a battle with Paul von Hindenberg, the 84-year-old field marshal and incumbent German president. One campaign poster showed Hindenburg as Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders alongside a diminutive caricature of Hitler jumping up and down in his brown shirt and screaming, “Ich bin noch viel starker!”—“I am so much stronger!” In April, Hindenburg crushed Hitler by 6 million votes. Hitler had his chief legal counsel, Hans Frank, go to court to have the election results overturned, claiming that there had been irregularities by state officials and that Hitler had been unfairly disadvantaged by not being permitted to speak on the radio. The presiding judge chided Frank for wasting the court’s time and dismissed the case, observing that 6 million votes was too large a margin for any of Hitler’s claims to have made a difference.\n\nUndeterred, Hitler made a bid for the chancellorship in August of that year, after Reichstag elections the preceding month in which the National Socialists won 37 percent of the vote. Arguing that this gave his party the largest share of a potential conservative coalition, Hitler demanded absolute power. Hindenburg rejected the idea out of hand, telling Hitler that he would never entrust the chancellorship to a man who was so divisive, hate-filled, and unwilling to compromise. Konrad Heiden, a regular contributor to Frankfurter Zeitung, was one of the most astute political observers of the day. “The entire German nation watched as Hitler ascended the stairs to power,” Heiden later wrote. “The entire nation watched as Hitler went flying back down those same stairs.”\n\nIn the highly polarized media landscape of the Weimar Republic, Hitler could expect little accommodation in the Social Democratic Vorwärts or the Communist newspaper, Die Rote Fahne, or even in centrist newspapers such as Vossische Zeitung and Frankfurter Zeitung. But the 1,600 conservative newspapers controlled by the right-wing media mogul Alfred Hugenberg provided at best backhanded support. Although Hugenberg’s papers praised Hitler for his belligerent nationalism and his desire to destroy democracy, they lamented his refusal to enter into a coalition government as politically misguided. Hitler dismissed the critique, saying he did not need the “golden rain” of Hugenberg’s media empire.\n\nHitler found favorable media coverage restricted to reprints of his speeches in the Volkischer Beobachter, the Nazi Party paper published in Munich, and Der Angriff, the Nazi Party paper published in Berlin. To extend his reach, Hitler leased Lufthansa passenger planes and crisscrossed the country, speaking at as many as five rallies in a single day, covering an estimated 40,000 miles in the course of campaigning in the various national elections of 1932. And to break out of the National Socialist echo chamber, Hitler had earlier tried turning to the foreign press.\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days\n\nFor help with this, he relied on Ernst “Putzi” Hanfstaengl, who had attended Harvard in the early 1900s and called on the connections he had made there for help in establishing a presence for the führer in the international press. In December 1931, Hanfstaengl had stage-managed an international press conference for Hitler at the Hotel Kaiserhof, across the street from the chancellery. “Adolf Hitler sat in Berlin giving press interviews as though he were already Chief of State,” Time magazine reported. Hanfstaengl scheduled a second press conference for the following week, expressly for British and American journalists. The event was canceled amid concerns that the government would conduct a police raid to prevent a repeat of the previous week’s presumptuous affront. As a substitute, Hanfstaengl arranged for a live broadcast with CBS radio, during which Hitler would address the American people. But that address, in turn, was scuttled when the German postmaster general denied Hitler access to the necessary state-owned radio cables. Paris-Midi wrote of “les tribulations héroï-comiques” of Hitler’s efforts to reach the broader public. (Hitler’s planned speech finally reached an American audience when William Randolph Hearst’s New York American published it, on December 13, 1931.)\n\nHanfstaengl also arranged the interview with Dorothy Thompson. During the interview, the chain-smoking Thompson observed Hitler’s rants with bemused detachment. After the interview, Hitler said, “Don’t ever bring me anyone like that again, Hanfstaengl!” Thompson, who would subsequently be banished from Germany—and who incidentally was married to the Nobel laureate Sinclair Lewis, who four years later would publish It Can’t Happen Here, a novel about the rise of a fascist dictator in America—went on to describe that encounter for Cosmopolitan. “He is inconsequent and voluble, ill-poised, insecure,” she wrote. “He is the very prototype of the Little Man.”\n\nHitler in the state of Braunschweig, where he would be appointed to a position as a mid-level civil servant in order to gain German citizenship. (Ann Ronan Pictures / Print Collector / Getty)\n\nThat same month, Harold Callender, a correspondent for The New York Times, also interviewed Hitler in his Brown House office, in Munich. Like Thompson, Callender watched with amusement as Hitler “rose from his chair, walked about the room, sat upon the table, but was never at rest,” making “nervous gestures” and all the time speaking with rhetorical fury, only occasionally “checking his rapid flow of speech to make sure his words were carefully noted.”\n\nIn response to Callender’s question about whether the National Socialists would seek power by democratic means or if he planned to “do away with parliamentary government,” Hitler replied that he planned to win power via constitutionally approved means—and then to revise the constitution and the entire structure of government in a way that “suits our purposes and will give us the power to conquer communism and the pest of Marxism. The present State, with its present constitution, is not in a position to do this.” Later in the interview, Hitler said, “Democratic theories and admonitions do not suffice to resist a force which is motivated not by belief in democracy but by bloody brutality.” If America had as many Communists and “Social Democratic Marxists” in its midst as Germany did, he went on, it would surely adopt the militarized approach of the National Socialists toward stamping them out. Though he declined to explicitly admit that anti-Semitism was “a fundamental part of his party’s platform,” he averred that “the attitude of the National Socialist movement to every inhabitant of this country is determined by that inhabitant’s attitude toward Germany.”\n\n(It should be noted that Callender’s reporting has aged better than the Times’ first article on Hitler, which in 1922 had asserted that “several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler’s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers.”)\n\nOn August 7, 1932, Hanfstaengl organized a press gaggle at Hitler’s alpine retreat on the Obersalzberg for the CBS-radio announcer H. V. Kaltenborn (who recalled Hanfstaengl as “one of my best friends” from Harvard; they’d taken a famous course on Goethe’s Faustus there together), the Associated Press Berlin bureau chief Louis Lochner, and the Hearst reporter Karl von Wiegand. Hitler subjected them to the usual diatribe and bluster. “That man is hopeless,” Wiegand said afterward. “Ask him a question and you get a speech. This whole trip was a waste of time.”\n\nHitler did find some sympathetic journalists. One was Sefton “Tom” Delmer, a reporter for the Daily Express, the British paper owned by the Hitler admirer Lord Beaverbrook. Delmer delivered just the sort of fawning coverage Hitler wanted. Delmer, who had attended President Hindenburg’s 80th birthday celebration and covered the launch of a zeppelin, concluded that “both of these great days faded into nothingness compared with the spontaneous and unprepared demonstration that greeted the smiling, bare-headed Herr Hitler” in early April 1932, when Hitler arrived in central Berlin to find “120,000 fanatical Berliners were waiting to hear him speak.”\n\nHitler rewarded Delmer for his adulatory journalism, inviting him to dinner and providing him with his direct telephone number (50-1-05-07). He also brought Delmer with him on the campaign trail. “Tomorrow morning at six o’clock I shall be in Herr Hitler’s airplane, the only newspaper representative to accompany the Fascist leader”—Delmer meant Fascist as a compliment—“on the whirlwind with which he is winding up his campaign in the presidential election,” he reported in spring 1932.\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: ‘Herr Hitler, do you really believe me capable of such a dirty trick?’\n\nLater that year, as Hitler endured another deluge of press ridicule, he turned again to Delmer for a boost. In the November elections, the National Socialists had lost 34 Reichstag seats, and Hindenburg once again rebuffed Hitler in his quest for the chancellorship. “It was most amusing to see old Hindy take Adolf out for a ride” and “put him in a beautiful hole,” Lochner noted for the Associated Press. “Hitler had been knocking on the door to power since 1923,” Konrad Heiden observed, in the Frankfürter Zeitung, but was apparently destined to spend his political career knocking on doors he would never enter.\n\nOn the evening of November 27, 1932, Hitler summoned Delmer for an interview in the Hotel Elephant in Weimar. “Not more than four months from now and the Presidential Cabinet will have fallen and our day will have come,” Hitler told Delmer, who passed this assurance on to his Daily Express readers. “This was the challenging statement made to me tonight, in an exclusive interview, by Adolf Hitler,” Delmer reported, “whom all the world believes to be in the depths of despair after the defeat of his latest bid for power, but who is in reality radiant with confidence that the hour of his supreme triumph is at hand.”\n\nHitler’s confident bluster belied the precariousness of his position: He was at that moment in the midst of one of the toughest internal party struggles of his political career, one that led to still more press mockery.\n\nAs the party hard-liners Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, and Ernst Röhm pressed for a rule-or-ruin strategy, Hitler’s more moderate lieutenants, including Gregor Strasser and Wilhelm Frick, felt the time had come for compromise and coalition building. When Strasser arranged for Hitler to meet with Kurt von Schleicher, the ultimate power broker in Berlin, to discuss potentially joining a coalition government, Hitler boarded an overnight train in Munich, only to be intercepted en route, in the town of Jena, by Göring, who boarded the train to wake Hitler at 6 o’clock in the morning and escort him off, before driving him to Weimar. Strasser and Frick were left waiting for Hitler on the platform in Berlin.\n\nThe opposition press made the most of this episode. A cartoon in Vorwärts shows a befuddled Hitler in his nightshirt, with tousled hair and spindly legs covered with protruding hairs, being led away by Göring. A newspaper headline in the same publication described “Hitler as You’ve Never Seen Him,” a satirical reference to a recently published book of photographs by his personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. The incident was dubbed Hitler’s Unterhosenszene—his “underwear scene.” A taunting rhyme made the rounds, which can be translated as “Hitler’s chancellorship is now sunk / Frick and Strasser are in a funk.” One commentator observed dryly that Hitler’s lieutenants looked so clueless only because Hitler was so clueless. To read press coverage like this was to conclude that Hitler was politically finished.\n\nBut Hitler seemed outwardly not to be bothered by the cacophony of derision and ridicule. “I have endured so much persecution and so many personal attacks during the 13 years of my struggle for Germany,” Hitler explained to then-Chancellor Fritz von Papen, who himself had previously issued scathing condemnations of the Nazi leader, “that I have learned to put the great cause I serve above myself.” The only thing that filled him with bitterness, Hitler told Papen, who was seeking a rapprochement with him, was watching establishment politicians squander the “hope, belief and trust” that the common man had placed in the country’s leadership.\n\nWhile awaiting trial and execution at Nuremberg for his role in Nazi atrocities, the Hitler attorney Hans Frank observed that it had been this alleged commitment to the common man and a “greater cause” that bonded the führer to his followers. “If one is to be brutally honest, one has to admit,” Frank explained, that Hitler “said aloud what was in the minds of most people and gave clear expression to what everyone was experiencing along with a plan to address the hopes and suffering of the people.”\n\nFrom the February 1937 Issue: Hitler looks eastward\n\nFrederic Sackett, the U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1930 to 1933, confirmed Frank’s assessment that the bond between Hitler and his political base seemed infrangible, no matter how ridiculous he appeared to the reporters who covered him. “The expectation frequently voiced here that failure of his policies would result in large and immediate losses of following for Hitler,” Shackett reported to the State Department, “does not take into account the blindness of great sections of his adherents.”\n\nHans Prinzhorn, a German psychiatrist and art historian, put this in different terms. After attending one of his beer-hall rallies, Prinzhorn observed how Hitler manipulated the crowd by dramatically modulating his voice, first rising to a “demagogic register” before falling silent, then continuing to speak in a subdued tone, “as if nothing had happened.” Prinzhorn also noted that Hitler limited himself to a small number of tropes that he repeated incessantly: the “treason of Versailles,” the danger of “Jewish influences,” his vow that “heads will roll” once he was in power.\n\nAccording to Prinzhorn, Hitler’s calculated and mesmerizing combination of volume, rhythm, modulation, and repetition induced the suspension of logic and reason in rally attendees, generating an emotional response in his followers that rendered him nearly impervious to rational attack by political opponents and probing reporters. “They keep thinking they’ve hit on a crucial point when they say that Hitler’s speeches are meaningless and empty,” Prinzhorn observed of reporters. “But intellectual judgments of the Hitler experience miss the point entirely.” Ambassador Sackett called Hitler “one of the biggest showmen since P. T. Barnum,” an “indefatigable spellbinder” with an uncanny capacity for “twisting events” to suit his “fancies and purposes.”\n\n“The country is getting tired of the Nazis,” The New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize–winning correspondent Fred Birchall reported in November 1932. Hitler’s “high water mark,” Birchall declared, had been the July Reichstag election when the National Socialists had won 37 percent of the seats. The German ambassador to Washington, D.C., affirmed this. Hitler, he told the U.S. State Department, had reached “the high point of his career,” and had damaged himself “irreparably” through continuous personal attacks on the revered President Hindenburg, his refusal to join a coalition government, and his public support for storm troopers who had savagely kicked to death a Polish immigrant in front of his mother. Hitler “had disgusted people with his defense of the murderers,” the ambassador said. Die Weltbühne, a weekly magazine, wrote, “Adolphus is the man of missed opportunities: 1932 opened a path to tremendous things. He stumbled. He fell.”\n\nOn January 24, 1933, Vorwärts published a cartoon, captioned “The New Hamlet,” which reflected the widely held view that Hitler’s political demise was at hand. Hitler stands in the graveyard of his political movement, surrounded by broken swastika headstones, pondering an effigy of his own head.\n\nLess than a week later, Hitler was chancellor.\n\nHitler greets President Paul von Hindenberg on the day he was named chancellor, January 30, 1933. (Classicstock / Getty)\n\nTo return to the question: How could Dorothy Thompson and so many other experienced journalists and political observers have gotten Hitler and their assessment of the historical moment so wrong? If they did, they weren’t any more off the mark than Hitler himself. In December 1932, Hitler’s movement was bankrupt financially, politically, ideologically. The party coffers were drained, the National Socialist movement tens of millions of Reichsmarks in debt. Even the loyalist ranks were plagued with infighting. Word among Hitler’s closest associates was that he had badly misplayed his cards. Hitler told Goebbels that he was contemplating suicide. Only an unlikely series of backroom deals and a frantic weekend of subterfuge in January 1933 rescued Hitler from the political brink and vaulted him to power.\n\nThe ridiculous “Little Man” that Thompson and many others had dismissed in previous years was the same person who became chancellor in 1933. The man hadn’t changed. The circumstances had. What remained consistent throughout was the demagogic emotional hold on his followers that Hans Prinzhorn had described.\n\nUri Friedman: Seeing Hitler everywhere\n\nFrom the vantage point of the present, Hitler’s rise seems overdetermined, and in some ways it was. But to have imagined in advance the series of events that brought such an unlikely figure to power would have required unusual powers of clairvoyance. As it happens, one of the few people to foresee Hitler’s ascendance was a self-proclaimed clairvoyant. Born to Jewish parents in Vienna, Herschel-Chaim Steinschneider ran a wildly popular Berlin venue called Palace of the Occult, and he held séances for Berlin’s fashionable set. Writing under the pseudonym Erik Jan Hanussen, Steinschneider published a March 1932 front-page story in the Berliner Wochenschau called “Hitler’s Future,” which predicted that Hitler would be chancellor within the year. Hitler met Steinschneider several times in the course of 1932 and reportedly invited him to his suite at the Hotel Kaiserhof in January 1933 to hold a séance. “I see victory for you,” Steinschneider told Hitler. “It cannot be stopped.” That a Jewish showman and occultist was providing spiritual guidance to the leader of the National Socialist movement was more fodder for mockery by the opposition press. “Hitler’s lucky star appears to be fading, but the cautious astrologists continue to wave the swastika banner, because one never knows,” Vorwärts reported on December 28, 1932. Vorwärts also wondered about Steinschneider’s Jewish parents, “who could never have dreamed that their son would become the promoter of an anti-Semitic Führer.”\n\nAlthough Hitler’s political struggles, and the general perception of him as a figure of ridicule, almost led him to suicide in late 1932, he was well accustomed to overcoming mockery. It fueled his ambition. Not long ago, while researching my most recent book, I listened to an audio recording Hitler had produced in the summer of 1932, in advance of the Reichstag elections, part of his effort to reach beyond the audience who read the critical mainstream press. The two-disc set is titled “Hitler’s Appeal to the Nation” and is emblazoned with a swastika that spins at 78 rpm. The recording was intended to be played at rallies across the country, and sold in bookstores, music shops, and newspaper kiosks for 1.6 Reichmarks (about $8 today). Hitler speaks in a notably measured tone—no ranting, no raving, no “Sieg heil!” choruses in the background. Still, despite the moderated tone, his seething, grievance-laden political message and his simmering mendacity penetrate through the hissing and crackling recording of the eight-and-a-half-minute address.\n\n“Thirteen years ago we National Socialists were derided and disdained by our opponents,” Hitler says. “No one is laughing now.”",

        "content": "For President Donald Trump, last month’s spat at the White House with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky was “great television.” To the rest of us, it was a horrifying realization of our worst fears: a real-time crumbling of the Euro-American alliance, which has been the bedrock of the international order since 1945.\n\nEuropeans have recently been discovering a new resolve for standing on their own. Perhaps the most candid response came from the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Kaja Kallas, who said that “the free world needs a new leader.”\n\nThere is plenty of good sense in the EU taking a resolute stand. The need for “strategic autonomy” is not only the preoccupation of French President Emmanuel Macron; it has been part of the bloc’s codified global strategy since 2016 as well. Now Trump is fulminating against the EU, claiming that it was “formed in order to screw the United States,” and European autonomy has become an urgent priority.\n\nBut to reduce this moment to a Euro-American clash, let alone to resort to clichés about the supposedly essential qualities of Europe and the United States, would be a fundamental mistake. The current rift is part of a broader battle for the soul of the West. On one side are those who believe that Western countries should continue to be characterized by open societies, Enlightenment values, pluralism, and liberal democracy, as they mostly have been for the past few decades. The most notable opposition to this status quo comes from ultranationalists who believe that the West has gone too far in its espousal of progress and liberalism, and that it must revert to a civilizational ethos centered around Christianity—one that is more traditional and less libertine, less feminist, and less internationalist (or “globalist,” as they like to call it). As a shorthand, I call them anti-liberal counterrevolutionaries.\n\nBoth sides have long had partisans in both America and Europe. For about a decade, the standard-bearer for the nationalist right has been Viktor Orbán, the self-styled “illiberal” prime minister of Hungary. Orbán’s fellow anti-liberal counterrevolutionaries have grown in political relevance and popularity across the EU, though they are still relatively marginal. For inspiration, they look to the Russia of Vladimir Putin, whose national chauvinism, banning of “gender ideology” and “gay propaganda,” and revisionism against the world order fit well with their agenda.\n\nMichael McFaul: The tragic success of global Putinism\n\nThe European far right traditionally fulminated against Atlanticism, decrying the United States as the fulcrum of a global liberal order from which Europeans must de-link. But the immense influence of anti-liberal counterrevolutionaries over Trump, especially evident in his second administration, has turned the tables. The world’s mightiest country is now an ally for Europe’s far right. Trump’s first term also encouraged these elements, but its direction wasn’t always stable or clear.\n\nThis time around, some of the most influential figures in Trump’s court have commitments to the anti-liberal counterrevolution: Vice President J. D. Vance, Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., and Tucker Carlson, to name a few. One common theme among these men is their championing of Orbán’s Hungary. In 2022, Carlson made a documentary about the country, portraying Orbán as leading “the fight for civilization” against the liberal philanthropist George Soros. Don Jr. made a well-publicized trip to Budapest last year and spared no words in praising Orbán’s Hungary as “one of the last beacons of hope in Europe.”\n\nZack Beauchamp: Make America Hungary again\n\nAmerican proponents of Orbán often praise his hard-line policies on migration and refugees, but this is a red herring. Politicians across the political spectrum in Europe have taken anti-migration positions of various kinds. The admiration for Orbán comes from his unapologetic assault on the liberal values that have defined the West for generations. In a now-famous speech in Romania in 2014, Orbán espoused his anti-liberalism in detail and attacked the United States in terms that have become familiar on the American right: “The strength of American soft power is in decline, and liberal values today embody corruption, sex, and violence and, as such, discredit America and American modernization.”\n\nOrbán’s critique is not of any one policy but of something fundamental about the soul of the West. And it reflects a view that has found fuller expression in the words of the Russian far-right philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, a treasured guest on Carlson’s show last year. Dugin sees a dichotomy between liberalism and its enemies that goes back to antiquity. For him, Putin’s Russia represents the “eternal Rome,” a land-based empire of conservative virtue, set against the liberal West’s “eternal Carthage,” a maritime empire of circulation and exchange. Dugin rails against the European Enlightenment, the intellectual root of modern rationalism and liberalism, and defines himself in the lineage of Counter-Enlightenment thinkers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe American right has another major critic of the Enlightenment much closer to home. The billionaire Peter Thiel has been compared to Dugin by the latter’s biographer. As early as 2007, Thiel offered a sweeping critique of Western enlightened thought, inveighing against both Karl Marx and Adam Smith for giving primacy to earthly human needs. Instead, he advocated for “an older Western tradition” that wasn’t afraid to “seek glory in the name of God or country.” Thiel argued that the Enlightenment was a “very long intellectual slumber and amnesia,” from which the West should reawaken into something more like the medieval age. He criticized George W. Bush’s administration for fighting the War on Terror in the name of democratic values and suggested instead an explicitly anti-Islamic campaign in the tradition of the Crusades. Thiel evinced an affinity for the German jurist Carl Schmitt—one of the Nazi luminaries, along with Heidegger, of the anti-liberal counterrevolution.\n\nSince 2019, Thiel has been a major supporter of the national conservative movement that has helped give an intellectual identity to Trumpism. Vice President Vance is a prominent figure in that movement. As early as 2021, Vance warned about a “civilizational crisis” in the West and claimed that “every single major cultural institution” in the U.S. had been “lost.” Earlier this month, when asked about European-American ties, he praised Europe as the “cradle of the Western civilization,” with which the United States has “religious bonds” and “cultural bonds,” before stating that Europe was “at risk of civilizational suicide.”\n\nVance’s answer is notable not just for what it states but for what it omits. The actually existing transatlantic relationship has long been based on a common espousal of liberal democracy, built on the legacy of defeating fascism in World War II. But for Vance, the proper foundation for Euro-Atlantic ties should instead be Christian faith.\n\nThe postwar order we have known was the product of a broad alliance that brought together socialists and liberals against fascism. This order dismantled colonial empires; it conceived of new institutions, such as the United Nations, to foster international dialogue in place of aggression, and new covenants, such as the International Bill of Human Rights, to codify both the civil rights advocated by liberals and socioeconomic rights advocated by socialists.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the anti-liberal counterrevolutionaries of today have no sympathy for this legacy. In fact, historical revisionism about World War II is an important feature of their movement. For years, the European far right has engaged in various forms of Holocaust relativization or outright denial. Last year, Carlson hosted the Holocaust-denying podcaster Darryl Cooper and introduced him as America’s “best” historian. Not only did Cooper make denialist claims about the Holocaust—he criticized the post-1945 order as making it “effectively illegal in the West to be genuinely right-wing.”\n\nYair Rosenberg: The anti-Semitic revolution on the American right\n\nThese are not isolated ideas but a political campaign, with proponents on both sides of the Atlantic, against the post-1945 order and the broader Enlightenment tradition. Its proponents reject the full spectrum of European and American liberal thought, from left to right, and hark back to a West defined by their reading of Christianity and traditional values.\n\nThe anti-liberals are a growing force in European politics. Last year, Orbán’s Fidesz party helped establish Patriots for Europe (PfE), the third-largest grouping in the European Parliament, with which 86 of 720 MEPs identify. Its most notable member is France’s National Rally, a once-marginal party that is now the main opposition force in the EU’s second-largest economy. The bloc’s other member parties are currently parts of governments in the Netherlands and Italy. The Trump administration has given these far-right entities new momentum. Elon Musk openly supports not just Orbán’s sister parties, such as Spain’s Vox, but even Germany’s AfD (Alternative for Germany), which was deemed too extremist for PfE and instead joined the more extreme Europe of Sovereign Nations, whose member parties are even more explicitly pro-Putin, anti-NATO, and anti-American.\n\nSuch extreme parties are still relatively marginal in European politics. Of the 27 member states of the European Union, at least 20 are currently led by mainstream liberals, centrist conservatives, or Socialists. For now, thinkers spanning a wide spectrum—the American center-right political theorist Francis Fukuyama, say, and the Slovenian Marxist Slavoj Žižek—can still share in the view of Europe as a bastion of Enlightenment values worth preserving.\n\nTo uphold the best of this European tradition now will require more from liberals than just a defense of the old continent against the new. Much as their anti-liberal rivals have done, Western liberals will have to forge transatlantic links and demonstrate their willingness to fight for their values. Broad fronts and global alliances made the post-1945 order. To keep it will require nothing less.",

Sign up for it here.\n\n“Everyone is calling it the”—Donald Trump paused while speaking to a crowd at a rally the day before his inauguration. “I don’t want to say this,” he insisted. “It’s too braggadocious, but we’ll say it anyway—the Trump effect.” He went on to describe how the stock market was booming and bitcoin prices were surging, and then boasted about a domestic-infrastructure investment from Apple, much of which had already been planned before the November election.\n\nIn spite of his claims to the contrary, Trump has no qualms about taking credit, including for achievements that were in progress or complete before he took office. The president has taken full responsibility for negotiating a hostage swap and a cease-fire deal in the Israel-Hamas war (Trump posted on social media in mid-January that “this EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November”), not mentioning that President Joe Biden had announced some of the deal terms last year. The Trump administration said that its policies had quashed migrant border crossings; immigration data are hard to parse, especially for such a short time period, but tallies show that border crossings had already been on the decline during the Biden administration. And this week, Trump credited himself with returning two astronauts who had been stranded for months at the International Space Station; last summer, NASA announced its plan to bring them home in 2025, but Trump still claimed without evidence that Biden “was embarrassed by what happened, and he said, ‘Leave them up there.’”\n\nTrump relied on similar framing during his campaign: Ahead of a debate with Biden last year, he posted that “low INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me, and the Trump Administration, not by Crooked Joe Biden,” saying of his opponent that “all he does is try to take credit for things done by others, in this case, ME!” Shared credit would have been appropriate here: Trump did sign an executive order in his first term that capped out-of-pocket costs of insulin for some Medicare patients at $35 a month, but Biden expanded this cap to all Medicare drug programs through the Inflation Reduction Act, affecting significantly more patients. Trump enjoyed taking credit for Barack Obama–era achievements during his first term too: In 2017, for example, he claimed credit for Obama’s immigration plan and bragged about a Ford-factory investment that had been in progress since a 2015 union contract.\n\nPoliticians are storytellers, and Trump is shameless about telling only the version of the story that flatters him. The stock market is thriving under the Biden administration? That’s thanks to projections that Trump will win, he claimed last year (even though economists suggested that such gains were also linked to low unemployment, flagging inflation, and solid growth). The economy is struggling after Trump takes office? Blame the “catastrophic” situation Biden left him with (even though many economists suggest that recent stock-market downturns are due to anxiety about the effects of Trump’s trade war). Talking about the egg-price crisis in January, the White House team pilloried the Biden administration for killing sick chickens, neglecting to note that this was a tack Trump also took during his first term.\n\nBiden struggled to communicate victories during his term, particularly those related to the economy, which left a “void” for Trump to fill, Lori Cox Han, a scholar of the presidency at Chapman University, told me. And Americans’ perception that the economy was struggling under Biden, boosted by their personal experience of inflation, affected how they voted. Whenever the White House changes hands, some projects inevitably bleed from one administration into the next. Embracing continuity between terms can be a sign that a president cares more about good policy outcomes than about bucking his predecessor: If a federal initiative is good for Americans, why not continue? But Trump is doing something different—he’s attempting to erase other presidents’ role in policy achievements entirely.\n\nPast presidents have also tried to claim credit for a victory set in motion by the previous administration—or perhaps even to hold off the victory until they can take office. The question of whether Ronald Reagan’s aides tried to delay the release of U.S. hostages in Iran so that they could come home during the early days of his administration—with the accompanying photo opportunities—has been discussed for years. Still, Han said, unspoken rules of decorum generally prevent new presidents from claiming full credit or trashing their predecessors. This, she noted, is another norm that Trump has disregarded.\n\nTrump has long sought to portray himself as America’s sole savior. Recall his 2016 campaign refrain: “I alone can fix it.” As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum wrote at the time, in beseeching Americans to place trust in him and only him, Trump “broke with two centuries of American political tradition, in which candidates for office—and above all, for the nation’s highest office—acknowledge their fallibility and limitations, asking for the help of their fellow Americans, and of God, to accomplish what they cannot do on their own.” Trump seems set on sending the message that he doesn’t need help—and that, implausibly, he hasn’t received any along the way.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nDonald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a call to discuss cease-fire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Trump suggested that America could assume control of Ukrainian power plants to protect that infrastructure. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and signaled that inflation may be slightly higher than their December forecast predicted. Turkish police arrested Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a top political rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on allegations of corruption and terrorism.\n\nEvening Read\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "American universities have given the country prosperity and security. The Trump administration’s attack on academic freedom endangers all of that.\n\nSign up for Trump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nThe United States is home to the best collection of research universities in the world. Those universities have contributed tremendously to America’s prosperity, health, and security. They are magnets for outstanding talent from throughout the country and around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration’s recent attack on Columbia University puts all of that at risk, presenting the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s. Every American should be concerned.\n\nThe rise of the American research university in the 20th century depended on many factors, including two crucial turning points. The first, at the start of the century, was the development of strong principles of academic freedom that allowed people and ideas to be judged by scholarly standards, not according to the whims or interests of powerful trustees, donors, or political officials. Stanford’s dismissal in 1900 of Edward Ross—an economics professor who had incited controversy with his remarks about, among other topics, Asian immigrants and the labor practices of a railroad run by the university’s founders—catalyzed a movement to protect the rights of faculty members to pursue, publish, and teach controversial ideas. Significant governance reforms took place in the same period, shifting control of professorial appointments from boards of trustees to presidents and faculties.\n\nClay Risen: When America persecutes its teachers\n\nThe second turning point came during World War II, when Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, created the modern partnership between the federal government and the country’s research universities. Bush recognized that by sponsoring research at universities, the United States could lead the world in discoveries and innovations. Over time, American universities became responsible for a large portion of the government’s scientific programs, accepting tens of billions of dollars a year to perform research that would make the country stronger and improve the lives of its citizens.\n\nThese two developments had an important connection. The government’s successful collaboration with American universities depended on its respect for academic freedom, which, for decades, presidents and legislators from both political parties largely observed. That freedom attracted the world’s finest scholars and facilitated the unfettered pursuit of knowledge.\n\nRobust federal funding helped make American universities the world’s best, but it also created a huge risk. Universities had acquired a public patron more powerful than any private donor; their budgets became heavily dependent on that single source. If the United States government ever repudiated the principle of academic freedom, it could bully universities by threatening to withdraw funding unless they changed their curricula, research programs, and personnel decisions.\n\nThat’s what the Trump administration did this month when it canceled $400 million in funding to Columbia without the legally required due process. The government told Columbia that the money would be restored only if the university met various conditions, which included placing its Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies department “under academic receivership” and making unspecified but “comprehensive” reforms to its student admissions and international-recruiting practices.\n\nRecent events have raised legitimate concerns about anti-Semitism at Columbia. The government can respond to those concerns without infringing on academic freedom. The principles of that freedom do not give faculty or students the right to disrupt university operations or violate campus rules. Nor does this freedom allow faculty to violate the scholarly standards of their discipline or compel students into political activity. To the extent that the government has grounds to investigate, it should use the processes required by law to do so, and it should allow Columbia to defend itself. Instead, the government is using grants that apply to Columbia science departments as a cudgel to force changes to a completely unrelated department that the government apparently regards as objectionable.\n\nNobody should suppose that this will stop at Columbia or with the specific academic programs targeted by the government’s letter. Precisely because great research universities are centers of independent, creative thought, they generate arguments and ideas that challenge political power across fields as varied as international relations, biology, economics, and history. If government officials think that stifling such criticism is politically acceptable and legally permissible, some people in authority will inevitably yield to the temptation to do so.\n\nFranklin Foer: Columbia University’s anti-Semitism problem\n\nNor should those who might revile the views expressed by some Columbia faculty members, or who dislike the university’s admission policies, take any comfort from this assault on academic freedom. Universities are now under attack from the right; in the future, left-leaning politicians may demand that universities do their bidding. Under such circumstances, the safest appointments may be the blandest ones—and brilliant scholars, those whom the world most needs, are rarely bland.\n\nThe attack on Columbia is a radical threat to scholarly excellence and to America’s leadership in research. Universities and their leaders should speak up and litigate forcefully to protect their rights.\n\nThe universities cannot, however, prevail alone. Strong, independent academic institutions produce new technologies and insights that catalyze economic growth, save lives, improve well-being, and overcome injustices. Every citizen and officeholder who cares about the strength of our country must also care about free speech, self-governing thought, and the untrammeled quest for knowledge. They, too, should demand a stop to the government’s unwarranted intrusion on academic freedom at Columbia.",

He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nConspiracy theories thrive in information vacuums, but that hasn’t stopped the government from withholding far too much information from the public. Getty Images\n\nFor half a century, conspiracy theories about the assassination of John F. Kennedy have flourished. President Donald Trump himself has dabbled in these theories, once claiming that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the former president’s murder.\n\nNow, Trump has officially declassified the remaining JFK files. And so far, the documents appear to be disorganized and hard to sift through, with some being entirely illegible because of a combination of age and bad photocopying. Some of the new insights include details on how the CIA wiretapped phones in Mexico City to surveil communications between the Soviets and Cubans.\n\nDespite being given access to everything that the government knows about the events that led to the killing of a US president, the public might not necessarily get the salacious answers they were looking for. But the move is undoubtedly a good one, regardless of whether the remaining files will uncover anything meaningful. Not only can people no longer accuse the government of continuing to hide evidence of some sort of cover-up, but finally releasing these files helps set expectations for the government to be more transparent in the future.\n\nThe public release of the JFK files is a reminder of how the government routinely fails when it comes to adequately communicating with the public. Its tendency to overclassify documents — whether they’re hiding mundane or explosive details of government operations — only gives conspiracy theories oxygen to thrive by creating an information vacuum.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way\n\nThough it might seem like the government has always been secretive, this wasn’t always the case. According to the historian Matthew Connelly, author of The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals About America’s Top Secrets, the tendency to keep more and more government records secret started after World War II.\n\n“For more than a century and a half after its founding, our government was remarkably transparent,” he said in an interview with Columbia Magazine in 2022. In previous wars, the government set up security agencies that kept sensitive information from public view, he said, but those agencies and their practices were usually dismantled after wars ended. That changed after World War II, when the government left its wartime practices intact. The result was a sprawling security state that started keeping more and more secrets as time went on.\n\nThe amount of information that the government keeps secret is staggering. Today, more than 50 million documents are classified each year.\n\nThis tendency to overclassify documents has gotten so extreme that there have been efforts to address it. Early in his presidency, Barack Obama signed an executive order creating the National Declassification Center to coordinate declassification plans across government agencies. The executive order also set deadlines for documents to be declassified unless they receive special permission.\n\nStill, these efforts are not enough and, experts still believe an excessive number of files are classified. One expert told the New York Times that only about 5 to 10 percent of the 50 million files merit classification.\n\nThey’re hard, if not impossible, to keep track of. Documents get lost. And it’s evidence that government agencies tend to err on the side of classifying something, even when it’s not really warranted.\n\nThe downsides of classification\n\nClassification for indefinite or long periods of time has the potential to mask a lot of wrongdoing and protect government officials from accountability. While it makes sense to keep some information classified, the government often overplays its hand, as with the Kennedy files. Time after time, it refuses to declassify documents pertaining to historical events that happened decades ago. In some cases, many of the people involved in the event in question have long been dead.\n\nThis ultimately leads to more distrust. “When you analyze what information tends to get classified, and what takes the longest time to be revealed, you can’t help but conclude that we paid a price for all that secrecy,” Connelly said. “Far from keeping us safe, the secret activities of government officials, the incredible risks they took, put us all in danger.”\n\nIn 1975, the federal government revealed that the CIA conducted mind-control studies starting in the 1950s, experimenting on human subjects with drugs and psychological torture. The experiments came to be known as Project MKUltra, and documents that detailed the program were eventually declassified, though some have been lost to history.\n\nThen, in 1991, the federal government acknowledged, for the first time, that it conducted experiments during World War II to test mustard gas and other chemical weapons on Americans enlisted in the US military. And in 1993, the government declassified documents related to the secret program. According to a later investigation by NPR, the government specifically tested troops based on race, singling out Black people, Japanese Americans, and Puerto Ricans to see how they would react to mustard gas compared to white people, who were also subjected to these experiments.\n\nObviously, the biggest problem with these unethical experiments is that they were allowed to happen in the first place. But when the government engages in these kinds of clandestine experiments and also keeps them secret for many decades, it only leads to further distrust in government. After all, efforts to keep those programs secret give people reason to believe that there is plenty more that the government is covering up, even when a classified report is relatively benign.\n\nKeeping so many records under wraps doesn’t just fuel conspiracy theories; it also prevents us from keeping an accurate historical record. “All that secrecy,” Connelly said, “has made it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, even to reconstruct the history of what really happened.”\n\nWhat to expect from the JFK files\n\nIn 1992, driven by public speculation about Kennedy’s assassination, Congress passed a law requiring that all files related to the assassination be released within 25 years, unless they posed national security threats. And after vowing to make these files public during his first term, Trump released some of the documents but delayed others, citing (surprise!) national security concerns. (The batch of documents that was released in 2017 included memos like the Soviet Union’s reaction to the killing.)\n\nNow, historians and experts are rummaging through the newly released files to see if they can find anything to add to the historical record. It’s unlikely that they’ll turn up any earth-shattering revelations about the assassination itself. Ninety-nine percent of the documents had already been public, and some of the remaining ones might be duplicates or have already been at least partially released.\n\nBut in the future, if the government is really concerned about conspiracy theories and what people think about its role in certain historical events, then it ought to stop keeping so many needless secrets.",

He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nIf the bipartisan consensus around helping foreigners had two spokespeople, it’d be George W. Bush and Bono. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nI have, like I suspect many readers, been in quite a bad mood for the last two months. My go-to joke explaining why — which I feel like should land with readers of this newsletter — has become: “I didn’t realize quite how much my overall optimism about the state of the world depended on the fact that Lindsey Graham likes foreign aid.”\n\nTo unpack that a bit: For many years, the US spent tens of billions annually on foreign aid, including billions on vaccinations, preventive gear, and treatments for cheap-to-treat killers like HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n\nIt did that not because a bunch of bleeding-heart liberals have been in power continuously for decades, but because a critical mass of conservative Republicans like Graham (and former President George W. Bush, and former House foreign affairs chair Michael McCaul, etc.) genuinely supported foreign aid, often out of sincere moral conviction. Aid actually grew dramatically under Bush, and remained roughly constant through President Barack Obama’s time in office and during Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThis, obviously, has not been the story of foreign aid under Trump’s second term. Already, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, acting as the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID) interim head, has canceled programs amounting to at least a third of USAID’s annual spending. Some areas were hit even harder: Efforts to improve maternal and child health are in for an 83 percent cut, and pandemic prevention is getting a 90 percent cut. (On Wednesday, a federal judge said that the Trump administration’s efforts to close USAID were likely unconstitutional and ordered the government to reinstate USAID systems, though it’s anyone’s guess how meaningful that ruling will prove to be.)\n\nDespite Elon Musk’s lies that the cuts in funding haven’t killed anyone, the lack of funds at HIV clinics caused by Musk, Rubio, and Trump has already led to children dying. Journalist Nick Kristof has some of the names of the dead. Working with the Center for Global Development, he estimates that more than 1.6 million could die within a year without HIV aid and prevention from the US.\n\nGraham, to his credit, has been pushing back, particularly in defense of PEPFAR, the US’s wildly successful anti-HIV program. So has McCaul. It just hasn’t mattered: The administration has seized control of spending from Congress, particularly on foreign aid matters, and so the bipartisan coalition that kept aid programs alive for decades has been largely helpless. Graham liking foreign aid has proved to be a less important positive for the world than I had thought.\n\nThis is an example of a broader, alarming trend in American politics that has been slowly unfolding over the past 10 or 15 years. At least going back to the 1980s, there was a kind of informal, cross-party consensus in the US around a set of policies that opened the US economy, and sometimes government coffers, to the world.\n\nIt was an era of elite cosmopolitanism, and that era feels like it is coming, or has come, to a close.\n\nThe globalist golden years\n\nThere were, of course, important and significant differences between the parties on a huge variety of issues during the period I’m talking about (let’s say 1986 to 2016, roughly, though I’m not wedded to either specific year). But on many international economic questions, there was broad consensus.\n\nBoth parties championed free trade. Ronald Reagan negotiated a tariff-reduction pact with Canada, and instead of reversing course, Bill Clinton followed that up with NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization; Bush and Obama followed up with trade deals of their own.\n\nBoth parties championed immigration. In 1986, Reagan signed a law providing amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and both Bush and Obama supported bipartisan congressional efforts to give legal status to those who came after that year.\n\nThe foreign aid part of the consensus is more recent. In the 1990s, USAID was hollowed out in terms of both staff and funding, both due to the end of the Cold War (removing a geopolitical reason for it to operate in countries at risk of Communist takeover) and due to a sustained assault from Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jesse Helms (R-NC), a dedicated foreign aid opponent and outspoken racist.\n\nBut foreign aid got a surprise second act under George W. Bush, who not only created and poured billions into PEPFAR, but also launched the President’s Malaria Initiative (which became one of the world’s leading anti-malaria funders) and made the US the first country to donate to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a major multilateral funder. Obama and Joe Biden supported these efforts, and they survived budget cut proposals during the first Trump term due to bipartisan congressional support.\n\nDespite the slightly different chronologies, I think lumping these three areas of bipartisan consensus — trade, immigration, and aid — together makes sense.\n\nAll of them involve American openness to foreign countries. All of them have benefited from “bootleggers and Baptists” coalitions combining moralists and baser economic interests.\n\nSome activists supported migration on moral grounds, but the US Chamber of Commerce was arguably the biggest booster; reducing trade barriers obviously helped businesses importing tariffed goods or exporting to tariffing nations, but many architects of trade liberalization felt a moral duty to use trade to help poorer countries like Mexico and China to grow; foreign aid serves a national security purpose in boosting US soft power, but Bush’s main motive in reviving it, and the main motive of most pro-aid activists I know, was a sense of moral duty.\n\nAll three issues, then, reflected a kind of light noblesse oblige on the part of US political elites. They were willing to take significant actions to help people born abroad, either staying there trying to survive (aid), staying there and trying to work (trade), or coming to the US (immigration).\n\nTheir willingness was not purely due to altruism. There were economic and geopolitical motives at work too. But the positive effects on billions of foreign-born people were real nonetheless.\n\nWhy the consensus fell apart\n\nIf this elite cosmopolitanism was able to support large-scale immigration, low trade barriers, and generous foreign aid for decades, why has it not been able to stop the Trump administration from devastating all three?\n\nIt’s not because the public suddenly changed its mind. While the Biden term was a period of historic anti-immigrant backlash, the consensus started fraying in Obama’s second and Trump’s first terms, when anti-immigrant sentiment was, perhaps surprisingly, at a low ebb. In June 2016, only 38 percent of voters said that immigration should be decreased, compared to 65 percent in 1993 and 55 percent in 2024.\n\nBut while restrictionists were a minority in 2016, they became a much louder and more influential one. The mass refugee flows from the Syrian civil war meant that the topic had higher salience in the US and especially in Europe. Most importantly, Trump broke basically every social taboo about discussing the topic during his primary run, and not only didn’t suffer but won the nomination as a result.\n\nIt wasn’t a majority position — Trump would lose the popular vote after all — but it was clearly more potent than previously thought.\n\nThe 2016 race also scrambled the politics of trade. Bernie Sanders’s stronger-than-expected challenge to Hillary Clinton led her to come out against Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, an anti-China trade pact that she passionately advocated for as secretary of state; she clearly saw in the strength of Sanders, and Trump, evidence that trade restrictionism had become a political imperative.\n\nClinton’s eventual loss due to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania led to a folk understanding among professional Democrats that not passing protectionist measures to help Rust Belt states would be electoral suicide.\n\nThis never made any sense; the shock of competition from China and elsewhere did hurt these places, but it’s long since over and no policy measures could ever bring manufacturing employment in Detroit back to where it was in 1970. But this conclusion meant that both parties were running away from open trade simultaneously, and as a result, the US as a whole has retreated from free trade over the last decade.\n\nIt is also possible, as political scientist Margaret Peters has argued, that immigration support has suffered precisely because trade was liberalized in the 1990s and ’00s. Historically, nativist forces have been kept at bay because of business lobbies supporting immigration, but the ability to offshore manufacturing to foreign countries provided an alternative for businesses to bringing in foreign laborers to the US.\n\nPeters argues that this effect, not just of trade deals but of things like standardized shipping containers, has undermined support for immigration over time by taking business lobbyists off the board. There go the bootleggers.\n\nThe saddest case, though, is foreign aid. Why did this tiny portion of the federal budget come in for such a beating this year?\n\nI don’t really have deep structural answers. Foreign aid has never been very popular, and voters routinely overestimate how much the US spends on it. It has always survived on elite, not popular, support, and was in a vulnerable position should someone like Elon Musk go after it. The declining religiosity of American conservatism also weakened the evangelical forces who so strongly supported PEPFAR under Bush.\n\nAs for why Musk had such a vendetta against foreign aid, the best explanation is that he fell under the influence of rabidly anti-USAID conspiracy theorist Mike Benz. He wouldn’t be the first dubious source who Musk decided against all reason to trust absolutely.\n\nPut all together, though, and the picture looks bleak for anyone who thinks the US can play an important role in making the lives of people around the world, not just here at home, better. In three different domains, the fragile coalitions supporting that vision have cracked and been beaten back. I’m not throwing in the towel just yet. But the game is going very badly.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nFederal law seeks to make communications technology like telephones and the internet, in the words of one older statute, “available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States.” A longstanding federal program that seeks to implement this goal is now before the Supreme Court, in a case known as FCC v. Consumers’ Research, and the stakes could be enormous.\n\nIf the Supreme Court accepts an argument raised by a federal appeals court, which struck down the federal program, it would bring about one of the biggest judicial power grabs in American history, and hobble the government’s ability to do, well, pretty much anything.\n\nThe Court will hear arguments in Consumers’ Research on March 26.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

In these areas, if telephone and internet providers charged a fair market rate, their services could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nWhich is why Congress created the Universal Service Fund. It effectively taxes telephone and internet service providers, and uses that money to pay for service to underserved communities. As a practical matter, service providers pass the cost of these taxes on to their customers in urban and other cheap-to-serve areas, so Americans living in cities wind up subsidizing telephone and internet in more sparsely populated regions of the country.\n\nBecause the amount of money the Fund must raise to achieve universal service will vary from year to year, Congress also tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with determining how much money the Fund should collect from service providers each year. The statute also provides the FCC with detailed instructions on how to determine the amount it should collect, and how that money should be spent.\n\nThis program has hummed along without incident for nearly three decades — the Fund was created in 1996 — until the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit abruptly declared it unconstitutional. If you’re familiar with the Fifth Circuit’s work, you know that this kind of thing is common. The Fifth Circuit is the most right-wing appeals court in the federal system, and its judges often strike down decades-old laws based on unusually creative interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nRelated The Trumpiest court in America\n\nThe Supreme Court, despite its 6-3 Republican majority, hands down a few cases every year reversing these Fifth Circuit decisions. Last May, for example, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s attempt to strike down an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nNevertheless, the Consumers’ Research case is worth watching for two reasons. One is that the Fifth Circuit’s decision was authored by Judge Andy Oldham, a Trump appointee who is widely considered a strong candidate for promotion to the Supreme Court in this administration. Oldham’s opinions are often sloppy, and his opinion in Consumers’ Research is no exception.\n\nThe second is that Oldham relied on a legal doctrine known as “nondelegation” in his opinion targeting the Universal Service Fund. The nondelegation doctrine claims there are strict constitutional limits on Congress’s power to empower federal agencies to do all kinds of things, from limiting pollution from power plants, to setting minimum standards for health insurance, to, at least if Oldham gets his way, providing broadband to rural communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court has only invoked this doctrine twice, both times in 1935, to strike down a federal law, and its decisions since then hold that the doctrine is more or less dead. Still, five of the Republican justices have, at various times, advocated for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. So there is a real risk that the Court could use the Consumers’ Research case as a vehicle to do so.\n\nIf that happens, it would shift a simply enormous amount of power from the elected branches of government to the judiciary. And it could potentially strip the federal government of a whole lot more than its power to equalize telephone and internet rates.\n\nWhy are the stakes in Consumers’ Research so high?\n\nCongress frequently enacts laws which lay out a general policy, then task a federal agency with implementing that policy and determining how to achieve it. The law creating the Universal Service Fund, for example, lays out the broad goal of taxing communications service providers and using that money to ensure that everyone has access to those services. But it is also recognized that the amount of money that needs to be raised to achieve this goal, as well as the question of how that money should be distributed, is a moving target that needs to be periodically reassessed by the FCC.\n\nOther laws delegate authority to an agency because technology evolves, and agencies employ experts who can monitor that technology and update federal policy accordingly. The Clear Air Act, for example, declares that certain power plants should use the “best system of emission reduction” that currently exists, while also accounting for factors such as costs. Because Congress recognized that the best system in 2025 will be more advanced than the best system that existed in 1972, it also tasked the EPA with determining what that system is and updating federal power plant regulations so that those plants use modern technology.\n\nThe stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions.\n\nThe idea behind the nondelegation doctrine is that the Constitution limits Congress’s power to delegate power to agencies in this way, but there’s a big problem with it: The doctrine appears nowhere in the Constitution itself, so judges who wish to apply it cannot refer to any text to determine which delegations of power are not allowed. If nondelegation were revived, the only real factor governing which congressional delegations are allowed, and which ones must be struck down, would be whether five justices wanted to strike a particular law down.\n\nMany right-leaning legal scholars have argued that this extraconstitutional doctrine is implicit in the Constitution, but it’s noteworthy that the people who actually wrote the Constitution disagreed with them. The First Congress made sweeping delegations of power to executive branch officials, giving them, among other things, the power to set regulations governing “all things touching” trade with Indigenous tribes, and the power to grant patents so long as they “deem the invention or discovery sufficiently useful or important.”\n\nAnd so the Supreme Court has historically treated the nondelegation doctrine with extraordinary suspicion. The Court did apply it twice, in 1935, to New Deal statutes which gave virtually unbounded power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but it has never done so again. Supreme Court decisions stretching back nearly a century permit Congress to delegate authority to federal agencies, so long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.”\n\nThough the current Supreme Court has not, at least not yet, struck down a law on nondelegation grounds, it did invent a similar legal doctrine — which, like nondelegation, cannot be found in the Constitution itself — known as the “major questions doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a majority of the Court may veto any action by a federal agency which five justices believe to be too politically or economically significant.\n\nRelated How the Supreme Court put itself in charge of the executive branch\n\nSo the stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions. But there’s also an important difference between major questions and nondelegation.\n\nUnder the major questions doctrine, the proper remedy, if five justices wish to veto an agency action, is to block that specific action — but to otherwise leave the federal law permitting the agency to act intact. The nondelegation doctrine, by contrast, often calls upon federal courts to toss out a statute delegating power to a federal agency altogether.\n\nBasically, the Court has already given itself the power to make a targeted strike on any individual agency action it doesn’t like, but it could use Consumers’ Research to carpet bomb agencies’ authority, stripping them of any power to act in the future.\n\nOldham’s Consumers’ Research opinion is extremely sloppy\n\nOne reason the justices might stay their hands in Consumers’ Research is that this case is a poor vehicle for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. The statute governing the Universal Service Fund provides detailed instructions to the FCC on how it should exercise its authority — far more detail than Congress provided in many other statutes that the Supreme Court has upheld against nondelegation challenges, including cases involving executive branch policy on navigable waters, natural gas rates, and commodity prices. Some of the statutes upheld by the Supreme Court do little more than instruct agencies to remove “unreasonable” obstacles to commerce.\n\nOldham should have followed these decisions, as he should have followed the Court’s precedents requiring him to uphold the Universal Service Fund statute so long as it provides an “intelligible principle” that the FCC can use to guide its decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund statute lays out six goals that the FCC should accomplish, in its efforts to provide telecommunications access to rural and poor communities. It specifies who should be taxed (“Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute”), and who should benefit from this tax revenue. And it instructs the FCC on how to determine the rate of taxation.\n\nOne provision, for example, states that rural customers should receive service “at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.” Thus, the FCC must tax service providers at a high enough rate to ensure that rural customers pay similar rates to urban customers, but not at such a high rate that rural customers pay significantly less than urban customers.\n\nThere’s simply no question, in other words, that the Universal Service Fund statute provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the FCC’s decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund would likely survive judicial review even under a more aggressive approach to nondelegation favored by some members of the Court. Dissenting in Gundy v. United States (2019), for example, Justice Neil Gorsuch proposed replacing the intelligible principle standard with a vague new rule providing that Congress must put “forth standards ‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed” whenever it delegates power. Here, Congress has laid out definite and precise rules governing who the FCC should tax, how much it should tax them, and how that revenue should be spent.\n\nSo how, then, did Oldham justify striking down the Universal Service Fund? The answer is he took extraordinary liberties with the law, ignoring most of the statute, openly defying the Supreme Court’s decisions, and simply making up new rules along the way.\n\nAt one point, for example, Oldham claims that only two provisions of the statute are “relevant” to determining whether it violates the nondelegation doctrine — a provision stating that the FCC should raise funds “sufficient…to preserve and advance universal service,” and another provision indicating telecommunications services “should be available at…affordable rates.”\n\nIf these were the only instructions the statute provided to the FCC, then Consumers’ Research might be a more difficult case. But, of course, Congress said a whole lot more than these two things when it instructed the FCC on how to wield its authority.\n\nOldham also relies on a concurring opinion, by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones, which the Supreme Court repudiated last spring. He places a simply enormous amount of weight on the fact that the FCC created a corporation, known as the Universal Service Administrative Company, which advises it on how to set Universal Service Fund rates. But the Supreme Court held in Sunshine Anthracite Coal v. Adkins (1940) that these sorts of advisory bodies are “unquestionably valid.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Oldham started with the result he wanted — striking down the Universal Service Fund — and then wrote an opinion pretending that the law actually supports his preferred outcome.\n\nSo how is the Supreme Court likely to approach this case?\n\nRealistically, it is unlikely that even this Supreme Court will strike down the Universal Service Fund. The statute is too detailed, and Oldham’s opinion is too nonsensically argued, to justify the result the Fifth Circuit wants to achieve.\n\nOne thing to watch out for, however, is whether the Republican justices attempt to shift the law governing nondelegation cases, while still upholding the Fund. The Court could, for example, write an opinion repudiating the intelligible principle test and upholding the Fund under Gorsuch’s “sufficiently definite and precise” standard — a standard that, because of its vagueness, would give judges far more discretion to strike down laws they do not like on nondelegation grounds.\n\nSo, while Oldham is unlikely to succeed in his ambitious attempt to sabotage the Fund, he may nonetheless achieve a significant victory. By ignoring the law in his Consumers’ Research opinion, Oldham gave the justices an opportunity to revive a dangerous legal doctrine, and to do so in an opinion that appears moderate compared to the reactionary Fifth Circuit.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nConservative activists have been dreaming of dismantling the Department of Education for decades.\n\nThey’re closer than ever to achieving their goal.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that he said would “begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.” That comes after, earlier this month, the Department of Education announced mass firings of its workforce, which would cut the department staff down to about half of what it was when Joe Biden left office — from about 4,000 to about 2,000.\n\nTrump had promised to abolish the department on the campaign trail, but since it was established by Congress and many of its functions are legally required, he can’t make it go away with a stroke of a pen. Instead, his team is slashing its personnel and will likely try to cut back its spending to the greatest extent they think they can get away with.\n\nNow, it’s very unclear how big the policy impact of these layoffs will actually be. The biggest things the Education Department does in practice are sending money to public schools that have many low-income students, sending money to help educate students with disabilities, and running the federal student loan program. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has said that the department would keep doing all these things — though staff cutbacks seem likely to make such services more dysfunctional.\n\nBut all this is an important symbolic victory for ideological conservative activists. Because, ever since the Education Department was created as a standalone agency in 1979, they’ve wanted it gone.\n\nThese activists generally argue that education should be a local matter without federal “interference.” Many of them also disdain the public school system and support bolstering private alternatives (or home schooling).\n\nFor 45 years, they kept on failing to get their way, even when Republican presidents were in power. For much of that period, the GOP was split on education: Anti-government conservatives wanted the federal government to stay away, but other Republicans saw a federal role in improving public schools.\n\nPlus, it was widely believed that abolishing the department would lead to political backlash and was likely impossible without congressional approval — so why bother trying?\n\nBut the past decade, and especially the past few years, have seen major shifts in the politics of public education and inside the conservative coalition — shifts that have finally made the time right for a full assault on the department.\n\nWhy conservative activists are finally getting (half of) their way now\n\nThe first shift was a bipartisan disillusionment with the federal efforts to boost learning in public schools that were embodied in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. NCLB was championed by Republican George W. Bush, but was ultimately criticized by both the left (too much focus on testing) and the right (too much government interference).\n\nOnce NCLB was repealed in 2015, Republicans essentially abandoned the idea that the federal government should try to improve public schools, which removed one rationale for keeping the Education Department around. (Back in 2018, Trump announced a plan to merge the Department of Education with the Department of Labor, but it went nowhere.)\n\nThe second, more recent shift is backlash among rank-and-file Republicans against public schools, due to anger over their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and culture war issues in the past few years. The right frames this as parents recoiling against the incompetence or ideological extremism of educators, administrators, and unions; the left frames this as conservatives targeting public schools with an exaggerated campaign of vilification.\n\nBut the result was that typical Republican voters became more open to shaking up the status quo on public education. That can be seen in the flurry of “universal school choice laws,” which allot families public funds to pay for private school tuition, that have passed in red states in the 2020s.\n\nSo abolishing the Education Department became a frequent applause line for Trump during his 2024 campaign — his newfound focus on this was no secret. Eliminating the department was the main theme of Project 2025’s education chapter, too — though this was no surprise, as the think tank behind the project, the Heritage Foundation, has been calling for that for decades.\n\nStill, even after Trump won another term, there was widespread skepticism that he could actually do it, given the belief that congressional approval would be necessary, and that Democrats would never agree.\n\nThat’s where the third change comes in: the entry of Elon Musk and DOGE to the conservative coalition. They have modeled a new approach to dismantling the agencies they dislike, something that has never really been tried at this scale. And now it’s the Department of Education’s turn in the barrel.",

        "content": "The finding, released this week, relies on data from the American Time Use Survey and shows that in 2023 about one in four Americans ate all of their meals alone the previous day, an increase of 53 percent since 2003. The analysis also found that eating meals solo, including at home or out at a restaurant, has become more common in all age groups, but most pronounced among those under 35.\n\n“The extent to which one shares meals,” says Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Oxford and co-editor of the World Happiness Report, “is an extraordinary proxy for measuring people’s social connections and their social capital. It underpins people’s social support. It drives prosocial behaviors, and all of that, in turn, leads it to be a very strong indicator — predictor — for people’s life satisfaction.”\n\nEconomic factors, like high income and employment status, are often used as indicators of happiness. But researchers found the ritual of sharing meals to be an even more effective indicator of general well-being than job status and salary. “That surprised us as a research team,” De Neve says.\n\nThe most obvious driver of solo dining is the rise of solo living. The share of single-person households in the US has steadily increased since the 1940s, when just under 8 percent of homes were occupied by one individual. By 2020, that number had grown to 27 percent. But even those who cohabitate choose to eat their meals alone. In 2023, about 18 percent of Americans who lived with others ate all of their meals alone the day prior, the report found, compared to 12 percent in 2003 — a 50 percent increase.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

As social media and smartphones became more entrenched in the 2010s, the less often people shared meals with others. (De Neve has no explanation for the spike in solo dining in 2011.)\n\nResearch shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities.\n\nThe finding also points to increasingly individualistic habits. Solitary pursuits branded as “self-care” may have led to increased isolation. The top reason cited by those who considered eating alone in restaurants in 2024 was to get more “me time,” according to consumer research polling from OpenTable and Kayak.\n\nThe rise of solo dining has implications beyond the table. Research shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities. Increased social isolation meanwhile can lead to feelings of loneliness, which, in turn, can lead to cardiovascular health risks and increased feelings of depression, risk, and anxiety.\n\nOn a broader scale, loneliness and solitary tendencies breed distrust, which has profound consequences for the state of civil society. The simple act of sharing a meal with a colleague or friend can help bridge divides and increase well-being.",

But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris’s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention.

And the firm’s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump’s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America’s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let’s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There’s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There’s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There’s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there’s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They’re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it’s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don’t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they’re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn’t going to switch to Trump just because they’re upset about high prices. So, it isn’t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged — like every other subgroup of people this election — overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can’t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there’s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris’s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee’s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump’s tally increased. And they also note that, according to AP VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year — while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the AP VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn’t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what’s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that’s naturally bad for whoever’s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call “the follower graph.” If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it’s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video — and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing — before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don’t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we’re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it’ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who’ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven’t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they’re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI’m not sure why that happened. I think we’re still waiting for data to come back. But I’d guess it’s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as “conservative” or “moderate” have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there’s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I’m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we’re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates — and especially nonwhite moderates — a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We’ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing Young people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research’s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They’re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn’t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that’s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group — white, nonwhite, male or female — is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It’s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat’s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort’s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush’s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama — while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that’s definitely true and it’s definitely part of the story. But I think that there’s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries — Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there’s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there’s a lot of theories you can make about that — response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, “How Democratic were your parents growing up?” zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn’t part of the Democrats’ problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There’s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap — just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women — for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that’s, roughly speaking, where it’s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there’s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, “gender equality has gone too far” spiked in recent years.\n\nI don’t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it’s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it’s extremely important for other people — who don’t need to win elections — to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I’m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there’s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, “How important are these issues?” And then, “What party do you trust more on these issues?”\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That’s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits — except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nI think there’s this nihilism that’s very popular in our industry — that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats’ strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it’s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn’t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question — about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging — I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we’re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party’s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories — and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party’s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can’t count on that happening forever. And even despite that — even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition — here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that’s capable of securing the Senate. But I don’t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don’t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself “the only real conservative” in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump’s border wall, and didn’t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation — or at least, heterodoxy — to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that’s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn’t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it’s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 20.5 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that’s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere’s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor “major change” and a “shock to the system” because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change — and feel more comfortable with the status quo — than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt’s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, “I know the cost of living is too high, and I’m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.”\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change — and cared more about that than preserving America’s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a “shock to the system” — though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump’s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party — namely, they’re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they’re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It’s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you’ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI’m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that’s really important is that regardless of whether it’s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, “Do you believe that AI will be able to perform most people’s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?” 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, “Do you think this will be good or bad?” Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it’s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it’s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don’t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.\n\nCorrection, March 18, 12pm: Trump won Nebraska statewide by about 20.5 points.

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect section, with a focus on animal welfare and the future of meat.\n\nIt’s now well established that for decades, major oil companies knew that burning fossil fuels would cause global warming, and yet did everything in their power to obstruct climate policy. They intensively lobbied policymakers, ran advertising campaigns, and funded think tanks to cast doubt on climate science.\n\nAccording to two new papers recently published in the journals Environmental Research Letters and Climate Policy, another industry knew of its role in climate change decades ago and engaged in similar tactics: the US beef industry.\n\nThe story begins in February 1989, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) held a workshop for a report on how to reduce livestock methane emissions. Experts at the time knew that cattle produce significant amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change at a much faster pace than carbon dioxide. (Today, almost one-third of methane stems from beef and dairy cattle).\n\nThis story was first featured in the Processing Meat newsletter Sign up here for Future Perfect’s biweekly newsletter from Marina Bolotnikova and Kenny Torrella, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. Have questions or comments on this newsletter? Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!\n\nThere was also increasing awareness among scientists and environmentalists about livestock’s impact on other environmental issues, like water pollution and biodiversity loss.\n\nA representative from the nation’s largest and oldest beef industry group — the National Cattlemen’s Association (NCA) — attended the EPA workshop, and soon after, an arm of the organization began crafting a plan to defend itself against what they anticipated would be growing attacks over beef’s role in global warming and other environmental ills.\n\nThe Cattlemen’s plan — an internal 17-page memo titled “Strategic Plan on the Environment” — went unnoticed for decades until two University of Miami researchers, Jennifer Jacquet and Loredana Loy, recently unearthed the document in the NCA’s archives.\n\nNotably, the beef industry plan had barely a mention about addressing cattle pollution. Instead, it centered around how the public and policymakers would perceive that pollution.\n\n“Public relations activity directed toward key influencers is a fundamental thrust of this plan,” one part reads. Other goals of the plan: to positively influence legislation and regulations, and commission experts to write papers in response to critics as part of its “crisis management” strategy. They hired one such expert to address the EPA’s report, which came out in August 1989 and called livestock “one of the larger” sources of methane.\n\nA cattle feedlot near Lubbock, Texas. Richard Hamilton Smith /Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIn 1996, the National Cattlemen’s Association merged with another group to become the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. The organization didn’t respond to an interview request for this story.\n\nLooking back now, the plan seems to be the blueprint for how the beef industry, and the broader animal agriculture sector, would go on to respond to climate scientists and critics for the next 35 years.\n\nWhile these delay-and-obstruct tactics largely mirror those of the fossil fuel industry, there’s one way the two sectors radically differ in their public relations wars: what role they say consumers should play to combat climate change.\n\nWhat polluting industries want you to do — or not do — on a heating planet\n\nOver the past decade, many environmentalists have become critical of focusing on individual actions — such as purchasing a hybrid vehicle, using efficient light bulbs, or flying less — as meaningful solutions to climate change. Critics argue that putting the responsibility of fighting climate change on individuals has been a tactic purposefully employed by fossil fuel companies to help them evade accountability.\n\nThat’s largely true. BP popularized the personal carbon footprint calculator while Chevron — which, to be clear, is an energy company — has run ads encouraging its customers to use less energy. A 2021 analysis of ExxonMobil’s communications concluded that the company is “fixated” on individual responsibility.\n\nBut when it came to the meat industry, Jacquet and Loy found the opposite: It really doesn’t want people to take the individual action of eating less meat.\n\n“Rather than embrace notions of individual responsibility, the animal agriculture industry hired scientists, pressured the media, and formed business coalitions to obstruct” initiatives that encourage people to eat less meat, the two researchers wrote in the Climate Policy paper.\n\nEconomist Jeremy Rifkin speaking at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Ford\n\nOne of the earliest examples of such obstruction occurred in the early 1990s, when economist and activist Jeremy Rifkin published the book Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture. Rifkin paired the book launch with a large coalitional campaign featuring advertisements, mass protests at McDonald’s locations, and a book tour, all aimed at persuading people in 16 countries to cut their beef consumption in half and replace it with plant-based foods.\n\nA beef industry publication considered Rifkin’s actions a declaration of war and the industry organized a “determined counterattack,” according to the Chicago Tribune. That counterattack included an advertising campaign telling people not to blame environmental problems on cows and the formation of an alliance of 13 industry groups to push back against activists like Rifkin, which included tactics like handing out hamburgers at one of his events. Around this time, the Beef Industry Council launched the infamous but influential “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner” marketing campaign with a budget of $96 million in today’s dollars.\n\nIt was effective: According to a 1992 story in the Washington Post, people screamed at Rifkin on call-in radio shows, his publisher received angry letters and phone calls, and his book tour was canceled early on because people called event hosts to either disparage him or pose as his publicist to cancel. Rifkin chalked it up in part to aggrieved cattle ranchers, a claim that the National Cattlemen’s Association fiercely denied at the time.\n\nThis back-and-forth fight over the American diet has continued ever since:\n\nMeatless Monday: The Meatless Monday campaign rose to prominence in the 2000s with celebrity support, featuring dozens of large university cafeterias and school districts ditching meat on Mondays, all of which angered the livestock sector. Meat industry lobbyists sent Baltimore City Public Schools\n\nThe Meatless Monday campaign rose to prominence in the 2000s with celebrity support, featuring dozens of large university cafeterias and school districts ditching meat on Mondays, all of which angered the livestock sector. Meat industry lobbyists sent Baltimore City Public Schools cease and desist letters for participating in the program, and an industry-funded academic at UC Davis named Frank Mitloehner called it a public policy tool to defeat animal agriculture. According to Jacquet, he also downplayed Meatless Monday’s potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions. (Disclosure: From 2012 to 2013, I worked at the Humane Society of the US on its Meatless Monday initiative.)\n\nUS Dietary Guidelines: In 2015, an advisory committee of government-commissioned nutrition experts recommended that the government modify the US dietary guidelines to encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption to make their diets more sustainable. In response, industry trade groups\n\nIn 2015, an advisory committee of government-commissioned nutrition experts recommended that the government modify the US dietary guidelines to encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption to make their diets more sustainable. In response, industry trade groups aggressively lobbied Congress and launched a petition that decried the committee experts as “nutrition despots.” Ultimately, the committee’s recommendation didn’t make it into the final dietary guidelines.\n\nThe EAT-Lancet report: In 2019, a In 2019, a landmark report published by nutrition and environmental experts recommended that people in high-income countries significantly cut back on meat for personal and planetary health. Mitloehner, the UC Davis academic, coordinated massive “#yes2meat” counter-campaign that spawned millions of tweets.\n\nSo why do fossil fuel companies and livestock producers seemingly have such a different take on personal responsibility? Jacquet says much of it comes down to the simple fact that consumers have relatively little flexibility in reducing fossil fuel use, so messages that encourage people to make lifestyle changes pose little actual threat to fossil fuel companies’ bottom line.\n\nIndividuals are “locked into a fossil fuel energy system,” Jacquet said. But “food is not like that,” she added. “You really do have a lot of flexibility in your diet, and you make those decisions three times a day. … These are really dynamic decision spaces, and that’s a threat” to the meat industry.\n\nTo state the obvious, individual dietary change alone is insufficient to reform the cruel, polluting factory farm system. But it is a start. To pass even modest regulatory reforms, policymakers will first need to see public support, and one way the public can show it is by eating less meat.\n\nNot only is it considered one of, if not the most effective individual actions to reduce carbon footprints, but dietary change also has cascading positive effects. Animal agriculture is arguably the leading source of US water pollution, a major air polluter, and far and away the main cause of animal suffering — around 25 land animals are factory-farmed each year to sustain the average American’s diet.\n\nAccording to agricultural economists Jayson Lusk and F. Bailey Norwood, eating less meat, milk, and eggs does affect how many animals are raised for food. It’s not on a 1:1 basis, but if more people reduce their animal consumption, they’d collectively send a signal to the industry to raise fewer animals.\n\n“It may be hard to see the consequences of our decisions,” the two wrote in their 2011 book Compassion, by the Pound: The Economics of Farm Animal Welfare, “but let there be no doubt, each purchase decision matters.”",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nTuberculosis is no longer the threat it once was in the US and Europe, but the disease is still killing more than 1 million people worldwide every year. Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nHumanity’s battle against tuberculosis has been one of slow and imperfect progress. The disease no longer kills one in seven people in the US, as it did in the 19th century. But look elsewhere and its burden is still terrible: TB killed more than 1.2 million people in 2023, likely making it once again the deadliest infection on Earth, after it was briefly supplanted by Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nAnd as John Green, YA author, YouTuber, and author of the new book Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection, told me in an interview: “That number is about to go up.”\n\nAs part of its evisceration of US international aid, the Trump administration is ending funding for its global TB programs. The US is the world’s largest single funder of tuberculosis treatment, and the spending cuts quickly interrupted medical care for TB victims. And any delay in treatment can lead to worse outcomes for patients and makes it more likely the bacteria will evolve to resist antibiotics.\n\n“All of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government,” Green told me. “Allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans.”\n\nThere may be as many as 10 million additional TB cases by 2030 because of the cuts, depending on how deep they ultimately are, according to one initial estimate. An additional 2.2 million people could die in that worst-case scenario.\n\nIt’s difficult to know what’s happening on the ground, as ongoing lawsuits try force aid funding to resume and the Trump administration itself has given conflicting information at times. One TB program director told The Guardian last week their funding had still not resumed despite receiving a reassurance from the administration that it would.\n\nThe funding freeze is not only a threat to people in the developing world who live with tuberculosis as an ever-present threat, Green told me — it also poses a risk to the US itself. Right now, Kansas has 68 active TB cases, one of the largest US outbreaks in recent history. One estimate from the Center for Global Development finds that US TB cases will rise in parallel with cases in the rest of the world. That won’t just increase health care costs — it will increase the risk that TB will become more drug-resistant and therefore deadlier to people around the world, including in the US.\n\nI spoke with Green about the history of one of humanity’s oldest infectious diseases, the threat posed by the Trump administration’s cuts, and what concerned people can do in response.\n\nOur conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat is the state of tuberculosis right now? Why do people in the US and other wealthy countries often think of it as a disease of the past, a problem that has been solved?\n\nI used to think of it as a disease of the past as well. I thought of TB primarily as the disease that killed John Keats, and then we figured out a solution to it, so now it’s not a threat anymore.\n\nBut in fact, tuberculosis is still the world’s deadliest infectious disease. It kills over 1.2 million people per year. That number is about to go up. It sickens about 10 million people per year. Around a quarter of all living humans have experienced a TB infection.\n\nNow, the vast majority of those people will never become sick. They’ll have what we call latent TB, where these clumps of white blood cells form what are called tubercles to surround the bacteria and keep it in check. But in about 10 percent of people who experience a TB infection, they will become sick.\n\nWe understand some of the risk factors for developing active TB disease. They include malnutrition, other health problems like diabetes, or HIV infection. But we don’t fully understand why some people develop active TB and others don’t.\n\nYou call the disease “weird” in your book. What is weird about TB?\n\nThe weirdest thing about TB is the cell wall that the bacteria builds. It builds this really thick, fatty cell wall.\n\nThat takes a long time to build, so TB has an extremely slow growth rate compared to other bacteria; in some cases, hundreds of times slower. That means that it sickens us slower because it takes a long time to overwhelm the body’s defenses.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why tuberculosis used to be a narratively convenient disease, a disease that was the subject of so many books. It was a narratively compelling disease because it tends to take a life slowly over the course of months or years, rather than all at once like a disease like cholera or the black plague.\n\nClassically, we understood death as something that occurred very early on in life because about half of people died before the age of 5, or something that occurred late in adulthood, in your 50s or after. Tuberculosis killed so many people in their 20s and 30s that it was called the robber of youth. But it also killed people early in childhood and late in adulthood. It killed indiscriminately.\n\nTo some extent, it still does. I mean, 218,000 kids are going to die of tuberculosis this year.\n\nWhat’s so frustrating to me is that all of those deaths are unnecessary because we’ve had a cure since the 1950s.\n\nThis disease has been with us forever. It was even glamorized to an extent in earlier generations. But then there was a transition when it became more stigmatized — it became associated with being dirty and poor. How did that happen?\n\nUntil 1882, at least in Northern Europe and the United States, it was generally believed that tuberculosis was an inherited genetic condition. But in 1882, the German doctor Robert Koch proved that tuberculosis was in fact caused by bacteria. The moment it became an infectious disease is really the moment that our imagining of the disease changed radically.\n\nInstead of being a disease of wealth and civilization, it became a disease of poverty. The implications of this were huge because it meant that we could control tuberculosis by trying to control the bacteria that caused TB. But it also meant that we wanted much more control over the lives of people living with tuberculosis.\n\nWe started to understand them very differently. We started to see people with tuberculosis as a threat to the social order.\n\nAt the same time, by the middle of the 20th century, we developed vaccines and cures. How did our perception of TB continue to change — and how did race increasingly factor into it?\n\nTB had long been understood by Europeans as a racialized disease. It was widely believed in Europe and in the US among white doctors that only white people could get consumption because it was a disease of civilization. To acknowledge that consumption was common among people of color and colonized people would have been to undermine the entire project of colonialism itself.\n\nAfter we understood the disease as infectious, it became racialized in a different way, where it came to be argued that people of color were uncommonly susceptible to tuberculosis. Instead of believing that it was impossible for them to get tuberculosis, people started to argue that their susceptibility to tuberculosis was owing to some factor inherent to race.\n\nNow, we knew this was hogwash from the beginning. There were lots of doctors, including African American doctors and researchers, pushing back against this notion. They argued, correctly, that the actual cause of tuberculosis was crowded living and working conditions, poor pay, malnutrition — all the stuff that today we know does cause tuberculosis.\n\nBut the racialization of the disease was so profound that it’s still shaping who lives and dies of tuberculosis.\n\nToday, how does tuberculosis look in the United States versus a place like Sierra Leone, which you cover extensively in your book?\n\nStarting in the 1940s, we began to develop treatments for tuberculosis that were very powerful. We created combinations of multiple antibiotics that, given over the course of several months or even years, could cure tuberculosis. This disease that had always been one of the leading human killers suddenly became curable.\n\nUnfortunately, we did a really poor job of distributing this cure to the places where it was most needed. As a result, we’ve seen the development of extensive drug resistance for tuberculosis, and we’ve seen a huge amount of ongoing suffering from the disease. The Ugandan HIV researcher Dr. Peter Mugyenyi said of HIV drugs in the year 2000: “Where are the drugs? The drugs are where the disease is not. And where is the disease? The disease is where the drugs are not.” And that’s very much the case with tuberculosis as well.\n\nIf you or I got tuberculosis tomorrow, even if we had a complex drug-resistant case, we would get access to the best personalized, tailored treatments of antibiotic cocktails we would need in order to cure our TB. But for someone like my friend Henry living in Sierra Leone, when he got really sick in 2019 and 2020, those drugs weren’t available to him.\n\nSo even though his TB was very curable, his life was at risk — not ultimately because of a lack of technology, but because of failure to get the technology to the places where it’s most needed.\n\nIn the book, you called TB both a form and an expression of injustice. It seems to me that TB is one very striking example of a pattern of injustice that applies across a lot of diseases.\n\nYeah. I think it’s really important to acknowledge that tuberculosis is not the only disease of injustice. Hepatitis is a disease of injustice. Malaria, HIV, cancer are diseases of injustice. When my brother got cancer, one of the first things he said to me was that there was a 94 percent cure rate if you have access to treatment, and about a 5 percent cure rate if you don’t.\n\nIt’s very hard to grapple with the fact that the real cause of a huge percentage of human death is injustice — the failures of human-built systems.\n\nThere are many deaths that we simply don’t have the technology or the tools to prevent. But there are many, many, many, many deaths that we do have the technologies and tools to prevent. It’s important to understand that as a justice problem, as an equity problem, as a failure to appropriately apportion the resources that we as a human species have developed.\n\nIt breaks my heart. It’s devastating. I’m often asked whether I think people are good. Like, at the end of this book, do I think people are good? And I can’t answer that question.\n\nWhat I can say is I think people are capable of extraordinary generosity and compassion and sacrifice. When people are proximal to suffering, they show an extraordinary capacity for giving. And when people are not proximal to suffering, when people don’t let themselves become close to the suffering of others, they can act monstrously.\n\nThere has been imperfect progress on global health, but progress nonetheless. But now the US government is pulling back from the global health commitments that have helped make that progress possible. What does this mean for TB specifically?\n\nThe United States has long been the most generous donor when it comes to fighting TB, and now essentially all tuberculosis-related funding has been cut. That’s catastrophic on a number of levels. To my Republican friends and congressional representatives, I try to compare it to the 2008 financial crisis when the capital markets just froze, and it was very hard to get them to start working again.\n\nIn many communities, that’s what’s happening as a result of this sudden, chaotic, very unpredictable, haphazardly rolled-out funding freeze. Hundreds of thousands of people have seen their treatment interrupted, and we know that’s a catastrophe, not only for those individuals, many of whom will die, perhaps most of whom tragically will die, but also because it means that they will develop drug resistance.\n\nEven a couple of weeks without getting access to your medication means a skyrocketing chance of drug resistance. Even if they’re able to get back on treatment, the relatively inexpensive treatment that worked before may no longer work. That means more cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis circulating in communities.\n\nIt’s also a threat to the United States. We have 10,000 cases of active tuberculosis in the US every year. We have a tuberculosis outbreak right now in Kansas. Tuberculosis anywhere is a threat to people everywhere and allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans. It’s bad news for human health.\n\nWe’ve made so much progress in human health during my lifetime. The year I graduated from high school, 12 million children died under the age of 5. Last year, fewer than 5 million did.\n\nIt’s easy to feel like that progress is inevitable or natural or somehow it was always going to happen. But it wasn’t always going to happen. It happened because millions of people worked together to make it happen, because we decided collectively to value children’s lives more and to work hard to protect them.\n\nNow what we’re seeing is the first regression of my lifetime when it comes to overall human health. We’re seeing it in the United States where life expectancy has been going down. We’re about to see it globally where tuberculosis cases, by one estimate, will increase by 30 percent over the next couple of years, leading to 13 million people getting sick every year instead of 10 million and leading to hundreds of thousands more people dying.\n\nAll of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government.\n\nI feel like it’s hard for people to understand the feedback loop that’s potentially in play here that can put our health at risk because diseases are spreading elsewhere. I think it’s also hard for us to take the long view.\n\nI’m curious where you think that failure comes from? And have you seen anything that’s sort of effective in overcoming that?\n\nI think we have to bridge the empathy gap. There’s always an empathy gap between every person, right? I don’t know what it’s like to be you. I don’t know about your joys and sorrows. And even when I do, I can only kind of situate them in my own experience. I can only relate to it through my own eyes because those are the only eyes I get to see through for the whole time that I’m here.\n\nAnd so there’s always an empathy gap, but that empathy gap grows or shrinks based on how close you allow yourself to be to the suffering and joy of others. And so you know when my uncle gets sick, I’m going to respond to that very differently than if I hear through the grapevine that someone else’s uncle is sick. And for me, the empathy gap is also a social justice gap.\n\nThe further the rich world feels from someone’s life, the less likely the rich world is to intervene. So for me, it’s about shrinking that empathy gap everywhere we can so that we understand that the lives of other people, even other people whose lives may feel distant from ours are just as real and just as important as ours, that their joy and grief and longing and loss is as real and profound as ours is.\n\nI try to do that in the book by telling Henry’s story because you can talk all day about what a great investment tuberculosis response is, and it is a great long-term financial investment. You can talk all day about how many people are dying of TB every year. All that just boils down to statistics. And the statistics don’t decrease the empathy gap, at least for me. And so I wanted to tell a human story at a human scale because I feel like that’s what really changes our perspective.\n\nWhat options are available to people like Vox readers, who want to contribute in some small way to making these problems better?\n\nIt sounds meaningless and everybody says it, but it’s true. When you reach out to your congressional representatives insofar as you’re lucky enough to have some say in your governance, it really matters. What funding we’ve been able to claw back for USAID is a result of people reaching out to their senators and representatives and those senators and representatives in turn reaching out to Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and saying, “This is ridiculous. This can’t happen.”\n\n\n\nIt’s really, really important that people in power hear that it is unacceptable for the United States to walk away from its long-term commitments to global health and human health, and that it’s unacceptable for the United States to break its promises. They need to hear it’s also bad for America. It’s bad for farmers who provide food aid. It’s bad for overall human health in the United States. We’re seeing our own numbers of tuberculosis cases go up every year, and that will accelerate now.",

        "content": "is a culture writer interested in reality TV, movies, pop music, Black media, and celebrity culture. Previously, she wrote for the Daily Beast and contributed to several publications, including Vulture, W Magazine, and Bitch Media.\n\nTo borrow a phrase from our foremost cultural observer, Azealia Banks, the boys are fighting.\n\nFor almost a year now, Drake and Kendrick Lamar have been embroiled in one of rap’s most public and memorable beefs. It all started back in March of 2024 when Future and Metro Boomin’ dropped the joint album, We Don’t Trust You, practically dedicated to sneak-dissing Drake. The most notable diss on the record, though, came from Lamar who’s featured on the song “Like That.” His “f— the big 3” line, referring to Drake and J.Cole, ignited a weeks-long back-and-forth between Drake, Lamar, and eventually a handful of other rappers.\n\nMost of the drama remained between Drake and Lamar, as they released several explosive songs accusing one another of some pretty heinous crimes, including Lamar calling Drake a “pedophile.” It was Lamar, who ultimately came out on top thanks to the Mustard-produced “Not Like Us.” The track became 2024’s song of the summer and a certified West Coast anthem. It also won five Grammys last month, including Record and Song of the Year. Lamar’s success also seemingly earned him the coveted gig of headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show last month, making him the first solo rap act to do so.\n\nAlmost a year since the release of “Like That,“ Drake and Lamar aren’t really at war. Drake, at least, has ostensibly waved the white flag, directing his ire at his and Lamar’s record label instead. On January 15, Drake filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group for defamation regarding the lyrics in “Not Like Us.” (He originally filed a petition last November accusing UMG and Spotify of “artificially inflating” the popularity of the diss track and participating in a pay-for-play scheme with iHeartRadio, before withdrawing it.) The current defamation suit claims that the allegations in “Not Like Us” specifically, the “certified pedophile” lyric, endangered Drake and his family. The suit references a shooting outside of Drake’s Toronto mansion a few days after the song’s release and two other break-in attempts at Drake’s home over the following two days. On March 17, UMG filed a motion to dismiss, stating that their signee “lost a rap battle that he provoked” and calling the suit “a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.”\n\nAfter nearly 15 tumultuous years in the game, Drake is hardly a stranger to mess and beefing with other rappers. At first, it seemed like this latest feud was exactly what rap’s sensitive king needed in a rather uninspired era in his career, defined by dull musical output and gross jabs at women. However, following Lamar’s verbal lashings and his heavily mocked decision to pursue legal action as a response, it’s hard to see how Drake’s career completely overcomes this moment.\n\nWho’s beefing with who?\n\nKendrick Lamar wins the Best Rap Album award for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers during the 65th Grammy Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 5, 2023, in Los Angeles, California. Johnny Nunez/Getty Images for the Recording Academy\n\nOn March 22, Future and Metro essentially released a breakup album from their frequent collaborator and former comrade, Drake. (Drake and Future have nearly 30 collaborations combined, and Metro executive-produced their 2015 mixtape What A Time to Be Alive.) We Don’t Trust You is packed with subliminal messages seemingly directed at Drake, regarding his shady maneuvers. However, it was Kendrick’s relatively gentle prodding on the track “Like That” that was ultimately the most incendiary.\n\nOn the track — which has sat at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in a row now — he raps “Motherfuck the big three, it’s just big me,” renouncing his informal association with rap peers Drake and Cole. On the recent Drake song “First Person Shooter,” off his latest album For All the Dogs, Cole claimed on his guest verse that he, Drake, and Lamar are the “Big 3” of the current era of hip-hop. Nevertheless, Lamar’s ire on “Like That” is mostly pointed at his noted frenemy Drake, brushing off his purportedly unstoppable commercial success. “Your best work is a light pack,” he asserts. “N—, Prince outlived Mike Jack.”\n\nCole responded first on April 5 with the track “7-Minute Drill,” featured on his aptly titled mixtape Might Delete Later. Cole throws shots at Lamar’s Pulitzer Prize-winning discography, calling his latest album Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers “tragic” and claiming his Grammy-winning sophomore album Good Kid, Maad City “put [listeners] to sleep.” He also promises to “humble” Lamar if “push comes to shove.”\n\nHowever, by April 10, Cole had rescinded his warning shot, including removing “7-Minute Drill” from streaming platforms. At his annual Dreamville Festival, he issued a heavily mocked quasi-apology to Lamar. “I tried to jab [Lamar] back, and I try to keep it friendly,” he told the crowd in North Carolina. “But at the end of the day when I listen to it, and when it comes out and I see the talk, that don’t sit right with my spirit.”\n\nBefore Drake could unleash his own diss, Future and Metro released the follow-up, We Still Don’t Trust You, on April 12. This time, A$AP Rocky got some punches in. On the song “Show of Hands,” he rapped “N—s in they feelings over women. What, you hurt or something? I smash before you birthed, son. Flacko hit it first, son.” This is presumably a response to Drake apparently dissing A$AP and his partner Rihanna, whom Drake previously dated, on his song “Fear of Heights.” (Fans have also speculated that A$AP means he previously slept with the mother of Drake’s son.)\n\nAnother one of Drake’s most famous industry mates, The Weeknd, appears on both Future and Metro albums. However, on We Still Don’t Trust You’s eighth track, “All to Myself,” he sings, “I thank God that I never signed my life away.” Fans interpreted that as a jab about Drake’s label OVO Sound, which, despite his heavy association with the label, The Weeknd ultimately never signed to.\n\nWho is Drake dissing on “Push Ups”?\n\nOn Saturday, April 13, Drake’s long-awaited response titled “Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)” mysteriously made its way to the internet. The seemingly unmixed demo made many social media users speculate whether the song was AI-generated before noted hip-hop commentator DJ Akademiks eventually played it — noticeably with some tweaks, like the omission of a line about P. Diddy and a different beat — on his livestream. Hip-hop radio station Power 105 also streamed a high-quality version of the song. Given Drake’s comments on Instagram over the weekend, including a photo of Uma Thurman single-handedly taking on a group of fighters in the 2003 film Kill Bill, all signs point to the track being legitimate.\n\nThat said, “Push Ups” is a hefty (and expectedly humorous) diss record, taking aim at Drake’s aforementioned opps while pulling some other parties into the crossfire. One of them is the Weeknd’s manager, CashXO, who he accuses of “blowing Abel’s bread trickin.” He also takes shots at Memphis Grizzlies player Ja Morant, who fans are speculating he was previously in a love triangle with.\n\nIn probably the silliest development of this multi-pronged feud, he throws some digs at rapper Rick Ross, another frequent collaborator of his. “This n— turning 50,” Drake raps. “Every song that made it on the chart he got it from Drizzy.” Ross swiftly followed up with his own diss called “Champagne Moments,” which quickly went viral. Among other insults and accusations, he calls Drake, who’s mixed, “white boy” and claims he got a nose job.\n\nDrake and Rick Ross at P. Diddy’s Ciroc The New Years Eve Party at his home on December 31, 2013, in Miami Beach, Florida. Johnny Nunez/WireImage\n\nAs for Lamar, Drake offers a pretty comprehensive rebuttal, poking fun at Lamar for apparently wearing a “size 7 shoe” and his collaborations with pop acts like Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.” (Lest we forget, Drake has also linked up with Swift for a check.) He also names some artists who he feels have surpassed Lamar’s stardom, including SZA, who’s signed to Lamar’s own Top Dawg Entertainment label. (She apparently doesn’t want to be involved.) There’s also a bar that many listeners, including DJ Akademiks, interpreted as an audacious mention of Lamar’s fiancé, Whitney Alford (“I be with some bodyguards like Whitney”). However, this could also be a misreading of a more obvious reference to the Whitney Houston film, The Bodyguard.\n\nDrake’s latest round with Kendrick took a particularly dark turn\n\nAhead of Lamar dropping his response, “Euphoria,” Drake released another diss track for Lamar on April 19 called “Taylor Made Freestyle” using AI-generated vocals from 2Pac and Snoop Dogg to “spit” on his behalf. Drake’s weaponization of artificial intelligence, specifically regarding the deceased Tupac Shakur, generated mixed responses online. Some fans were amused by his “innovation,” while others, including Snoop, seemed downright confused. However, after his and Lamar’s most recent round of disses, these criticisms would be the least of his concerns.\n\nOn April 30, Lamar finally dropped his rebuttal titled “Euphoria” on streaming platforms. He spends most of the 6-minute track poking holes in Drake’s public persona. Among other digs, he questions the Canadian rapper’s proximity to Black American culture and his relationships with women. A few days later, Lamar followed up with “6:16 in LA,” claiming that Drake has a “leak” in his camp.\n\nPresumably, Drake wanted to get ahead of any dirt Lamar could possibly expose by dropping the track “Family Matters” this past Friday, along with a music video. In addition to Lamar, Drake has some more words for Ross, The Weeknd, and even Pharrell Williams. However, it’s Lamar’s fiancée, Whitney Alford, who’s the primary target of Drake’s claims.\n\nFirst, he suggests that one of Lamar’s children is actually fathered by his general manager, Dave Free, who’s also the former president of Lamar’s former label, Top Dawg Entertainment. Then he makes the more troubling allegation that Lamar “puts his hands on” Alford. “They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen,” he says at the end of the track.\n\nSeemingly tipped off by a mole, Lamar followed up just a few minutes later with “Meet the Grahams,” with cover art featuring a box of the weight-loss drug Ozempic supposedly prescribed to Drake. In that song, Lamar addresses his verses to Drake’s son, Adonis, and Drake’s parents. “Dear Adonis, I’m sorry that man is your father,” he bluntly opens the track. He also dedicated a verse to Drake’s alleged 11-year-old daughter, who would be the second child the rapper has kept hidden from the public. Drake, however, was quick to jump on Instagram and shut down the claim that he had a secret daughter.\n\nMore strikingly, though, Lamar refers to Drake as a “predator” and even likens him to Harvey Weinstein. Later that evening, Lamar dropped yet another track — this time, produced by DJ Mustard, who seemingly also has beef with Drake — “Not Like Us,” where he outright calls Drake a “pedophile.” In particular, social media lost it over the triple entendre, “tryna strike a chord, and it’s probably A-minor.”\n\nOn May 5, it seemed like Drake was ready to bow out after releasing the track “The Heart Part 6.” In addition to the curious claim that he purposely planted false information for Lamar to use, he spends most of the song denying that he sleeps with underage girls. He even addresses a controversial incident from 2018, when Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown, who was then 14 years old, stated in an interview that she texted the rapper about boys.\n\nIn a haphazard move, Drake attempts to connect these claims to Lamar’s own trauma, referencing the “one record where [Lamar] said [he] got molested” titled “Mother I Sober” — only Lamar doesn’t state that he was sexually abused on the song. In rapping about his cousin who was accused of sexual assault, he claims twice on the track that his cousin didn’t touch him, despite his family not believing him.\n\nDrake ends the song with a rambling spoken outro, similar to Nicki Minaj’s Megan Thee Stallion diss “Big Foot” earlier this year. “I’m not going to lie,” he says. “This shit was some good exercise.” In a noticeably exhausted tone, he says “it is what it is,” seemingly waving a white flag.\n\nStill, that hasn’t stopped Lamar from publicly reveling in the chart success of “Not Like Us” and the support of his industry allies. On June 19, otherwise known as Juneteenth, Lamar held “The Pop Out: Ken & Friends” at the Kia Forum to celebrate Los Angeles rap and, once again, broadcast his hatred for Drake. At the concert, which was streamed on Amazon and Twitch, Lamar performed “Not Like Us” six times. With each replay, a growing number of musicians, athletes, and other big West Coast names — including YG, Steve Lacy, Russell Westbrook, Black Hippy, and Mustard — joined him onstage, in what looked like an Avengers ensemble of Drake haters.\n\nDrake has previously thrived in beefs — but can he win when the whole industry is against him?\n\nFor the most part, Drake has handled his public gang-up with an expected sense of humor and irreverence. However, with the latest releases, he seems to be fighting a battle he can’t win, using wishy-washy bars to attempt to toss off some serious allegations. It’s worth noting that Drake’s domestic abuse claims against Lamar are just as serious. Nevertheless, rap fans on social media seem more invested in the seedy gossip that’s surrounded Drake’s mostly private romantic life, including these unsettling accusations about underage girls. Plus, after years of dominating the rap scene and making enemies out of several rappers, it seems social media users are ready to see the rapper taken down a few pegs.\n\nAs anyone who’s even slightly followed rap over the past decade and a half can attest, this isn’t Drake’s first time engaging in warfare with his peers. Most famously, his career has seen headline-generating battles with Meek Mill, Pusha T, Joe Budden, and Kanye West. Arguably, his most infamous tiff was the culmination of a long-brewing beef with Pusha T in 2018, where the Virginia rapper exposed Drake’s formerly hidden son, Adonis, to the world.\n\nMore recently, however, Drake has been involved in several seemingly one-sided beefs with famous women. On his 2023 song with 21 Savage, “Circo Loco,” he threw out a not-so-subtle diss at rapper Megan Thee Stallion (“This bitch lie ’bout getting shots but she still a stallion”), joining a chorus of famous men disputing her now-proven claims that singer Tory Lanez shot her in the foot in 2020.\n\nDuring the rollout of For All the Dogs, he vexed actor Halle Berry, who claimed he used a photo of her for the artwork for his single “Slime You Out” without her permission. Additionally, he’s attempted to reignite drama with his former fling Rihanna. Aside from his digs on “Fear of Heights,” he played their collaboration “Work” at one of his concerts just to claim that he “doesn’t sing [the] song anymore.”\n\nDrake’s songwriting is often propelled by a sweeping sense of grievance and an obsession with the past and his haters (he’s not that different from Taylor Swift after all!). However, his constant feelings of victimhood within his relationships with women — and the subsequent, more blatant misogyny that’s grown out of that — has begun to wear on critics and parts of his female fanbase. It’s an observation that Lamar has sharply utilized in his diss tracks over the weekend.\n\nWhile this latest beef originally seemed like an ultimately invigorating experience for Drake in a snoozy part of his career, Lamar’s accusations of Drake being a “pedophile” and other predatory behavior have left a strong stench on Drake’s public image. It’ll be fascinating to see whether the seemingly invincible rapper can rebuild fans’ respect after such dark claims. However, history has proven that male rappers can still thrive despite the most sordid allegations.",

Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to The Logoff: Today I’m focusing on Donald Trump’s purge of Democrats from an agency responsible for policing corporate America, another attempt to eliminate lawful checks on the president’s authority.\n\nWhat’s the latest? Trump fired the only two Democrats on the five-member board that runs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the agencies responsible for enforcing laws that protect consumers and check corporate power. Both of the commissioners say they plan to sue over the firings, arguing they are illegal.\n\nSo, are the firings illegal? The president can only lawfully fire FTC commissioners — who serve seven-year terms — for incompetence or malfeasance. That’s according to the statute that created the FTC, as well as a 1935 Supreme Court ruling that held President Franklin Roosevelt broke the law when he fired a Republican commissioner for opposing his agenda.\n\nTrump’s team isn’t claiming either malfeasance or incompetence, instead telling the commissioners they were fired because their service is “inconsistent with [the] administration’s priorities.” But Trump has issued an executive order asserting the president can fire any executive branch appointee at will. That legal question is likely headed for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Logoff The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

The FTC’s setup is meant to tilt power toward the party in power, as the president picks the board’s chair. But it’s also supposed to reflect bipartisan priorities, as no more than three commissioners are supposed to come from either party. Unless Trump’s firings are overturned, the board will solely reflect Republican priorities, which Democratic critics say will mean a lax, pro-corporate approach to enforcement of consumer protections.\n\nWhat’s the big picture? Since taking office, Trump has continually pushed to remove checks on his authority. In this case, Republicans had control of the agency, but not total control — and that (lawful) limit on Trump’s power was more than this administration could live with.\n\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nA commuter wearing a protective mask enters a subway station in the Herald Square area of New York on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the media did not exactly cover itself in glory. To quote myself from an early February 2020 piece, when the virus had already been spreading for more than a month in China and the US already had confirmed cases:\n\nIn the last week or so, new cases of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus have soared … so have news articles scolding us for worrying about it. “Don’t worry about the coronavirus. Worry about the flu,” BuzzFeed argued. The flu “poses the bigger and more pressing peril,” the Washington Post said. “Why should we be afraid of something that has not killed people here in this country?” an epidemiologist argued in the LA Times. Other outlets have agreed. An ex-White House health adviser has told Americans to “stop panicking and being hysterical.”\n\nMy article made the case that maybe it was slightly reasonable to worry about the coronavirus. But of course, I got some crucial stuff wrong, too. I wrote:\n\nSimilarly, there’s a conspiracy theory circulating that the virus escaped from a Wuhan research lab. (Not true.) And there’s a different conspiracy theory that it was engineered by Bill Gates (who funds a research group that has done pandemic-control exercises about a hypothetical deadly coronavirus). (Also not true.) Internet trolls have spread false claims that drinking bleach protects against coronavirus. (Please don’t do this.)\n\nTwo of those conspiracy theories were in fact absurd, but one was correct: the virus absolutely may have escaped from a Wuhan research lab. We’ll probably never know, but we know for sure that many of the scientists publicly asserting that this was a wild conspiracy theory privately worried that it was true.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut my article isn’t the main thing that people think of when I ask them how they feel Vox handled the early coronavirus crisis. Instead, almost everyone I talk to remembers another article that Recode (at that time a vertical of Vox) ran a week later.\n\nThe piece was headlined “‘No handshakes, please’: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus,” and while it doesn’t actually contain any blatant factual inaccuracies, the tone is very clear: Only a paranoid tech bro would be worrying about the coronavirus.\n\n“Data from the CDC suggests that the flu is a greater threat to Americans than the coronavirus. Yet unlike the flu, the coronavirus is new and not well understood, which makes it especially scary to the public, including Silicon Valley’s elite,” the article argues. But of course, even at that early moment in the pandemic, it was entirely correct to be more nervous about the novel coronavirus — which had a much wider range of possible outcomes — than a known health threat like the flu.\n\nAlmost no one I talk to here in the Bay Area about Vox’s performance on Covid-19 remembers my article pushing back on dismissiveness and warning people should take Covid more seriously. Almost all of them remember the contempt they felt that the Recode article was encouraging toward them.\n\nRelated What the media needs to get right in the next pandemic\n\nThe lesson here — for the media and for anyone who works in public communication — is that it’s much easier to lose trust than to gain it.\n\nMoving forward without ever looking back\n\nA few weeks later, Europe was hit hard with the first catastrophic Covid surges — hospitals overwhelmed, bodies piling up, patients struggling to breathe in hallways — and the media started taking Covid seriously.\n\nIn a sense, this is exactly what is supposed to happen — people saw new information and changed their minds. But the fact that there was an abrupt swerve was rarely acknowledged.\n\nWhen a journalist writes a piece that contains a clear factual inaccuracy requiring a correction, it’s a pretty big deal. I’ve had to issue corrections, and quite a few people are involved: my boss has to spend a fair bit of time working with me on the wording, and their boss has to sign off.\n\nCorrections are a high priority in the media — people will drop lots of other work to get a correction to a piece up. Journalists feel real pressure not to get things factually wrong, and to fix them when they do. A reporter having written several pieces that needed serious corrections is the kind of thing that will absolutely show up negatively on a performance review.\n\nBut there’s no clear mechanism for similar reflection when a piece doesn’t necessarily get the facts wrong, but just frames them wrongly. That’s a problem, because framing can do just as much to misinform readers as facts.\n\nThe price of ignoring getting it wrong\n\nIn the case of the Covid pandemic, early coverage that dismissed peoples’ fears and suggested they were irrational probably delayed our collective response — and lastingly decreased the credibility of the media and public health communicators when they later needed to muster a serious response.\n\nA lot of the fault here lies with public health officials, many of whom initially downplayed the threat and called the lab origin theory a conspiracy. But too often the media tended to treat these proclamations without the skeptical questioning that was warranted, especially given the uncertainty. And while I’ve chosen to highlight the early February spats over whether Covid was less concerning than the flu, this pattern repeated itself over and over again.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThe initial justification for lockdowns was that we just needed a few weeks to slow the spread so our first responders weren’t overwhelmed; but then those lockdowns persisted, without clear acknowledgment that the plan had changed. On masks, the line went from “masks don’t help much and should be reserved for first responders and doctors” (the contradiction here rarely acknowledged) to “masks are crucial.”\n\nOutdoor gatherings were always much safer than indoor ones (and I said so here in Vox from early on), but a lot of public health officials criticized outdoor gatherings — up until the Black Lives Matter protests, at which point they largely said such events were fine.\n\nEvery one of these changes happened without much reflection on why we had previously got it wrong. Every one of them spent credibility that was desperately needed with the American people. Every one meant treating people, frankly, like they weren’t very smart, and in the long run did incalculable damage to public trust.\n\nSo why hasn’t there been more of a reckoning? The primary reason is that there are incredibly powerful incentives for everyone involved not to participate in one.\n\nWith something as new and as fast moving as Covid, it was almost inevitable that everybody would get something radically wrong. When we open up the Pandora’s box of recriminations and accountability, our mistakes loom much larger than our correct calls.\n\nThe sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, one of the better pandemic commentators, wrote earlier this week about how we were lied to about the possibility of a Covid lab leak. She was met by near universal, seething hostility from Twitter, which blamed her for all of the New York Times’s bad coverage of everything related to the whole pandemic.\n\nA better way to cover uncertainty\n\nI’m expecting a similar overwhelmingly negative response to this piece, in which I admit a mistake — initially dismissing the lab leak theory — that everyone had probably forgotten about. Ours is a media environment that doesn’t encourage acknowledging your errors; it’s much safer to memory hole them.\n\nWith Covid, this has been made worse by the fact that there are still major disagreements over key questions about our response. I think that masks work to prevent the spread of disease, though I also think we made the wrong tradeoff in requiring kids to wear masks and generally refused to acknowledge what a major sacrifice they were for many people who just hated the feeling on their faces.\n\nBut that’s not satisfying to someone who thinks that all masking policy was a mistake and that a true Covid admission of errors would mean admitting that masks didn’t work, period. I think the vaccines were great, so my takeaways on the lessons from Covid won’t be convincing to the half of the country that thinks the vaccines were terrible.\n\nGiven all that, it’s not shocking that there hasn’t been a real Covid reckoning. But I think that has been very, very damaging.\n\nEvery single one of us lived through a devastating period during the pandemic. Many of us buried loved ones. Many worked to exhaustion in overcrowded hospitals. Many were asked to make sacrifices that they feel were later treated with contempt and indifference.\n\nIt was a massive, collective world-altering event — and now that it’s over we barely talk about it, because talking about it would mean reckoning with it and no one in power wants to reckon with it.\n\nSo Covid’s long-term effects will reverberate through the country: lower trust in institutions, an absolute unwillingness to think seriously about preventing the next pandemic, failing schools, and rising isolation. And all that will unfold without any real clarity on how we got here and how we can make sure it never happens again.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

In defining the genre, it also shaped childhood for generations of Americans. The Walt Disney Corporation might be the house that Mickey Mouse built, but he did it on Snow White’s dime.\n\nHow Snow White went from “Disney’s Folly” to Disney’s greatest success\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs advertisement, 1937.\n\nFrom the outside, Snow White had all the makings of a boondoggle. No one had ever made a feature-length animated film before it, and looking at the silly, squishy, fluorescent cartoons of the era, it was hard to imagine why anyone would want to sit through one that lasted over an hour. Cartoons are good for a giggle, but who wants one that stretches on forever? Still, Walt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit. Getting the medium to that point would prove to be expensive.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Disney turned his animation studio into what was essentially a laboratory for how to make a great animated film. He had long considered his “Silly Symphony” shorts to be the artistic cousin to the slapstick Mickey Mouse shorts, and now he was taking them more seriously than ever. He poured money into figure drawing lessons for his animators, into classes on the art of the great European fairy tale illustrators, into studies on how the play of light should look in animation. He paid for huge and expensive leaps forward in technology, most notoriously the creation of a multi-plane camera that allowed for new levels of depth and perspective within a single frame.\n\nWalt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit.\n\nIn the end, Snow White cost $1.5 million in 1937 dollars, about $34 million today. Newspapers of the time called Snow White “Disney’s folly.” Instead, when Snow White made it to theaters, it became a smash hit.\n\nAudiences reportedly burst into tears when they saw Snow White lying in the glass coffin, surrounded by weeping dwarves. The premiere was greeted with a standing ovation. Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet director who invented montage, declared it “the greatest film ever made.” It grossed $66 million at the box office, becoming briefly the highest-grossing sound picture ever until Gone with the Wind premiered two years later.\n\nBefore Snow White, no one had ever managed to make animation so naturalistic and expressive. The animation in short films up until that point had been silly, vaudeville-inflected; mostly featuring animals because humans were too hard to draw in an appealing way — mostly with static and unchanging expressions, on flat, simplistic backgrounds. But Snow White took place in a deep, rich, painterly world, and Snow White herself was a charming, beautiful human figure who could blush and laugh and cry in ways that made the audience blush and laugh and cry right back at her. It was an entirely new effect, one to which people responded powerfully.\n\nOne surprising thing In the 1937 Snow White, not all the human characters were as naturalistic as Walt Disney would have liked. The Prince’s role was minimized as much as possible because Disney felt they could never quite get his face right. Watch it again and you’ll see what he meant.\n\nBut Snow White also had commercial appeal in a way that seemed to flummox Disney, and that took him a while to figure out how to duplicate. He continued developing Snow White’s animation style over his next two features, 1940’s Pinocchio and Fantasia, both of which arguably surpassed Snow White in artistic accomplishment — but also failed to make money. The massive success of Snow White bought Disney enough credit that he could keep taking out loans to finance his ever-more-expensive films, but after Fantasia, the company was near bankruptcy.\n\nDisney made Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942) on the cheap, abandoning the expensive oil painting look of his first three films for a more stylized, pencil-stroke-heavy animation style that could be churned out quickly. The company kept floating through World War II on the strength of a series of military propaganda films, but it wouldn’t achieve a true box office smash again until 1950, when it released Cinderella, a movie that followed carefully in the footsteps of Snow White.\n\nIn a world where the two highest-grossing Disney films were Snow White and Cinderella, the matter became settled: A successful Disney movie would look like Snow White. Even today, after Pixar, after fully rendered animation, after Frozen, it still does.\n\nHow Disney learned the Snow White formula\n\nA Snow White character acts in Mickey’s Soundsational Parade at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, on Friday, May 24, 2013. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDisney occasionally messes with the formula, but the great classics of the studio tend to follow this basic template set by Snow White 90 years ago.\n\nSnow White was a musical because commercial films in 1937 were musicals. In today’s Hollywood, musicals aren’t commercial guarantees, but we still think of music as being fundamental to the Disney formula. Snow White begins the movie by wishing for her prince to come and the prince singing back to her — now Disney movies tend to give their protagonist an “I want” song and the lovers a duet. Snow White doesn’t have a villain song, but the Evil Queen is so fabulously campy that songs like “Poor Unfortunate Souls” are a natural extension of the legacy she began.\n\nNot all Disney animated movies are about princesses or even based on fairy tales, but in unprofitable periods, Disney generally turns to a princess to turn things around. The Little Mermaid in 1989 rocketed the studio out of its so-called dark age and into the Disney Renaissance, and after a slump in the 2000s, Disney leaned hard into the princess formula with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, and Frozen. Disney fairy tales tend to be gently bowdlerized and made sentimental (Snow White didn’t wake up because of true love’s kiss until Disney got their hands on her), and to this day, the studio loves adding a didactic moral lesson to their tales, like the lesson in Snow White that love conquers all.\n\nSnow White had cute animal sidekicks as well as comic magical ones; both would become a staple of Disney storytelling going forward. Snow White’s blue and yellow and red gown would become her signature outfit, an increasingly important piece of Disney’s visual iconography and of the princesses that followed. Snow White even innovated the classic Disney strategy of keeping the hero’s hands clean by having the villain die accidentally, falling from a great height in the middle of a crescendo of evil laughter.\n\nWhat Disney left behind following Snow White were some of its most stylized elements. At moments, the animation plays with the jagged, aggressive lines of German Expressionism: When Snow White runs into the wild forest, the trees loom out of the darkness and the eyes of wild animals flash at her in lurid, vicious cuts. Disney would continue to play with this aesthetic in Pinocchio and Fantasia, which is part of why they are largely considered to be his scariest films, but later animated features would smooth out such frightening scenes into gentler, less thrilling action sequences.\n\nDisney would also abandon the part of Snow White that plays most strangely for modern audiences. As critic Caroline Siede has written, Snow White is constructed like a classical opera or a ballet, with static, unchanging characters. You might think of Snow White as a figure like Pamina, the ingenue in The Magic Flute: she’s at the center of the plot, but all she does is fall in love over the course of a single duet, and she never really changes after that. Her funny magic sidekick and villainous mother figure steal the show. In later films, Disney would embrace a more cinematic style of storytelling, with characters who want more than true love and who have to overcome some internal flaw in order to get what they want.\n\nThe first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic cliche.\n\nThe new live-action Snow White plays as an uncanny attempt to retroactively apply this formula to Disney’s oldest and strongest story. In the new film, Snow White wants to protect her kingdom from the selfish Evil Queen, but to save the day, she has to overcome her fear and self-doubt. She still sings “Waiting on a Wish” by the wishing well, but now she sings about how much she wants to be brave. All the updates are so generic that in the end, the whole thing reads as storytelling by committee.\n\nYet as Disney attempts to update its storytelling, it leaves behind the part of Snow White that had those first audiences sobbing in their seats: that ravishing, painterly, glorious hand-drawn animation. The first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic cliché.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nWhen a Democrat contemplates their nation’s biggest problems today, minimum lot sizes in suburban housing codes probably don’t rank very high on the list.\n\nBut a new book asks Democrats to do precisely that. In Abundance, journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson catalog American liberalism’s failures to deliver material plenty — the housing shortages that plague blue cities, the green infrastructure that congressional Democrats funded but then failed to actually build, the high-speed rail system that California promised but never delivered. Klein and Thompson argue that these disappointments have a common source: Since the 1970s, American liberals have been more concerned with obstructing harmful economic development than promoting the beneficial kind. Democrats have prioritized process over outcomes and favored stasis over growth, most notably through their support for zoning restrictions, stringent environmental laws, and attaching costly conditions to public infrastructure spending.\n\nRelated This is why Kamala Harris really lost\n\nTo revitalize American progressivism, they sketch an “abundance agenda”: a series of regulatory reforms and public investment programs aimed at facilitating higher rates of housing development, infrastructure construction, and technological progress.\n\nKlein and Thompson speak for a broader faction of “abundance liberals,” which encompasses the Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement, various pro-innovation think tanks, and scores of commentators. In addition to Abundance, the faction has recently produced two other books outlining its critique of American liberalism’s evolution since the 1970s, Why Nothing Works by Marc Dunkelman and Stuck by Yoni Appelbaum.\n\nIt is surely true that blue states’ governance failures are not this moment’s most pressing crisis. But Democratic areas’ inability to avert cost-of-living crises — or to build infrastructure on time and budget — is a political liability for the party. Such mismanagement has not only called liberals’ competence into question, but also chased millions of people out of large blue states and into red ones over the past 10 years.\n\nCalifornia and New York have been shrinking while Florida and Texas have been growing — trends that will make it much harder for Democrats to win the Electoral College or Congress after the 2030 census. Disempowering an increasingly authoritarian GOP should be Democrats’ top priority in 2025. But bringing abundant housing, energy, and infrastructure to blue states is conducive to that task. This makes Klein and Thompson’s analysis politically relevant.\n\nNevertheless, not everyone on the left buys what they’re selling. And Abundance has some real flaws.\n\nIn their concern with winning over progressive skeptics, Klein and Thompson sometimes elide the genuine tradeoffs between their vision and progressive ideology. For example, while they lament the stifling impact of various environmental regulations on housing and clean energy construction, they’re cagey about precisely how, and how much, they want to change such laws. Rather than stating plainly that they’re willing to reduce regulatory obstacles to fossil fuel infrastructure for the sake of abetting the build-out of renewables — a position Klein has endorsed in his New York Times column — they argue that going into details about how environmental laws should be amended would be beside the point, since “no individual law” would solve all the problems they identify and “What is needed here is a change in political culture, not just legislation.” Such slipperiness may make Abundance more palatable to progressives, but also invites distrust.\n\nThis said, much of the left’s criticism of abundance liberalism is off-base and unfair. One especially prominent charge is that the abundance agenda entails a retreat from the progressive movement’s commitments to economic justice and equality. In this account, Klein and Thompson want Democrats to stop catering to the particular needs of poor and working-class Americans — through expansions of social welfare programs or labor regulations — and start concentrating on maximizing economic growth.\n\nThe New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes that the abundance movement views stagnation as a “national emergency” that requires “liberals to sideline their quest for a Scandinavian-style social democracy.” And he fears that the pursuit of Klein and Thompson’s vision could yield a less equitable society.\n\nWallace-Wells nevertheless endorses some aspects of the abundance agenda. Other critics are less measured. Dylan Gyauch-Lewis argues in the American Prospect that abundance liberals prize “growth above all,” and that their ideology is merely a repackaging of “free-market dogma.”\n\nLikewise, The Baffler’s Alex Bronzini-Vender derides the abundance agenda as a “Koch-funded initiative” aimed at “reversing the Democratic Party’s skepticism of neoliberal orthodoxy.”\n\nThese criticisms are off-base in more ways than one.\n\nFirst, it’s simply not true that Klein and Thompson call on liberals to abandon welfare state expansion or to pursue growth at all costs. They explicitly state that “redistribution is important” — their argument isn’t that expanding the safety net is undesirable, but rather, that doing so is insufficient for maximizing ordinary Americans’ living standards.\n\nFurther, Abundance argues that the federal government should play a larger role in managing the economy, so as to accelerate the development of socially valuable technologies and steer economic growth in an ecologically friendly direction. To say that Klein, Thompson, and other abundance liberals are free market dogmatists because they oppose some regulations is a bit like saying Joe Manchin is a Stalinist because he opposes Medicare cuts.\n\nBut those who critique the abundance agenda on egalitarian grounds are making a more fundamental analytical error: Combating regulatory obstacles to housing construction, infrastructure, and energy production is not just compatible with prioritizing the interests of working-class Americans; it is synonymous with that task. An economic system biased toward scarcity and stagnation is one that serves the already comfortable better than the disadvantaged.\n\nThe left’s suspicions of abundance liberalism are understandable. On a variety of fronts, Klein and Thompson call for paring back rules and regulations that are coded as progressive, in the name of abetting faster economic development. The left is used to denouncing this general proposition.\n\nYet abundance liberals are not calling on Democrats to forsake genuinely progressive restrictions on production, such as the Clean Air Act or minimum wage, for the sake of maximizing GDP. Rather, they are imploring their party to judge regulations on the basis of results rather than vibes. Rules that ostensibly subordinate free markets to the public good — but actually undermine ordinary Americans’ living standards — are not worth defending.\n\nRelated The surprising theory that explains modern American life\n\nWhy Democrats should make priority-setting a priority\n\nSuch regulations fall into a few broad categories.\n\nOne consists of seemingly progressive — but ultimately counterproductive — mandates appended to public spending. In recent decades, liberals have gotten accustomed to using government-funded projects as vehicles for delivering “wins” (however minor or symbolic) to their coalition’s myriad stakeholders. Yet as Democratic legislators multiply the number of different causes a discrete project is supposed to serve, they often undermine their policy’s core purpose.\n\nSan Francisco’s approach to public housing is one of Abundance’s signature examples of this phenomenon. The Golden Gate City suffers from one of the highest homelessness rates in the United States. Increasing the supply of publicly subsidized housing should therefore be one of its government’s priorities.\n\nYet the city’s public housing policy is not designed to maximize the number of affordable homes in San Francisco — but rather, to build some affordable homes, while promoting small businesses, signaling concern for disabled people, improving the aesthetic quality of the city’s architecture, increasing employment among local construction workers, and furthering a wide array of other liberal causes.\n\nThe rules that San Francisco has attached to its affordable housing program may sound progressive on their face. The city reserves publicly subsidized housing contracts for small builders, in a bid to combat the power of big developers. It also requires public housing projects to pass a review by the Mayor’s Office of Disability and the San Francisco Arts Commission, hire locally, buy power from the city’s public utility, and meet a panoply of other criteria.\n\nBut each of these provisions increases the costs of construction. Prohibiting large contractors from building affordable homes leads to delays, as there are only so many small construction companies in the Bay Area and each has limited capacity, by definition. Ensuring that housing is accessible for the disabled is surely vital. Yet all housing projects in the United States must already be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act; mandating an additional review by the San Francisco Mayor’s Office just adds a redundant layer of bureaucratic processing. And while pretty buildings are preferable to the alternative, when thousands of San Franciscans are going unhoused, architectural aesthetics should take a backseat to rapidly growing the affordable housing stock.\n\nTaken together, these little rules add tens of millions of dollars to the price of every affordable housing project in the city. The typical publicly subsidized apartment building in San Francisco takes more than 6 years to build and costs more than $600,000 per unit. By contrast, a private philanthropy in the city recently erected 145 studio apartments for the chronically homeless in three years, at a cost of just $400,000 per unit. This efficiency is derived largely from the fact that privately funded housing projects don’t need to comply with as many requirements as public projects do.\n\nSaying that San Francisco should cut red tape in its affordable housing program may sound like a conservative sentiment. But in its actual effects, that red tape is reducing the supply of affordable housing while reinforcing the impression that the government cannot build things as competently as the private sector. These do not seem like progressive outcomes.\n\nThe progressive case for a freer housing market\n\nAbundance liberals tell a similar story about zoning restrictions.\n\nAmerican municipalities in general — and Democratic ones in particular — heavily restrict the types of housing that the private sector can build. It is illegal to construct anything but a detached single-family home on roughly 75 percent of America’s residential land. Local laws add various other cost-increasing limitations on housing development, from large minimum lot sizes to parking mandates to design requirements.\n\nThe progressive case against restrictive zoning is straightforward: Affluent suburbs use single-family zoning to keep out working-class families, who might be able to afford an apartment in their municipalities but can’t shoulder the expense of a large house with a yard.\n\nMore broadly, making it illegal to build multi-family housing in most of the country ensures scarcity. According to some estimates, America has 4.5 million fewer homes than its people require. This shortage increases the value of our nation’s existing housing stock — which is good for homeowners and landlords but bad for renters. A policy that benefits those who own property at the expense of those who don’t is regressive by any definition.\n\nMany progressives have accepted the force of this argument. But some further to the left still disdain the push to liberalize zoning laws. And their aversion to that project is not difficult to understand. The idea that one of America’s biggest economic problems can be mitigated by loosening restrictions on free enterprise is ideologically unpalatable for many.\n\nBronzini-Vender’s essay in The Baffler well illustrates many leftists’ allergy to this argument. In it, he argues that abundance liberals are selling the public a fiction: Unleashing homebuilders from “zoning regulations” would increase Americans’ living standards, since the “private sector would supply more goods at lower costs—if only it could.”\n\nHe suggests this simply is not plausible and “betrays a deep misunderstanding of capitalist production”: Firms do not want prices to fall as that would erode their profit margins, so they will choke off production long before it starts substantially increasing affordability.\n\nThere are a few problems with this reasoning. The first is empirical. Capitalist production has, in fact, routinely yielded more goods at lower costs. Since 2000, the prices of durable consumer goods in the US have fallen by roughly 25 percent.\n\nAnd in the realm of housing specifically, zoning reforms have led to increased production and greater affordability. In Minneapolis, the lifting of various zoning restrictions in 2018 was followed by a surge in housing construction and a decline in the city’s median rent: Adjusted for local earnings, a home in Minneapolis was 20 percent cheaper in 2023 than it had been in 2017. In New Zealand, the city of Auckland’s experiment with zoning liberalization yielded similar results.\n\nThe second problem with Bronzini-Vender’s argument is theoretical. It assumes that the only way capitalist competition can yield lower prices is by forcing companies to accept lower profit margins. And since developers do not want their profits to fall, he reasons that they will tacitly collude to limit housing production, irrespective of zoning laws.\n\nThis is not a sound economic analysis. If you reduce how much it costs to produce a unit of housing — by legalizing apartment buildings or eliminating expensive regulatory requirements — then developers can charge lower prices while keeping their margins constant.\n\nFurther, firms can outcompete each other on price — without forfeiting profitability — if they increase their productivity. Durable goods have not become cheaper over the past quarter century because manufacturers and retailers have become more altruistic or less profitable, but rather because they’ve increased the amount of stuff they can supply per worker hour. (Some of this productivity increase is the result of outsourcing production to low-wage countries, but much of it is from innovations in production and logistics.)\n\nOne surprising thing The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the federal government to draft statements analyzing the environmental impacts of its decisions. When the law was first enacted, these statements were as short as 10 pages. Today, the average one is 600 pages long.\n\nAs Klein and Thompson note, between 1935 and 1970, construction productivity steadily rose in the US. But over the past half-century, it has actually fallen. Zoning reform could plausibly reverse that trend by making it easier to mass produce sections of housing in factories, a process known as modular construction; as is, in order to conform with housing regulations, builders typically need to construct homes almost entirely onsite.\n\nMere deregulation will not ensure universal housing affordability. It will never be profitable to provide housing to low-income people, in the absence of public subsidies. And the private sector is liable to underproduce housing for middle-income people as well. The government can help fill in these gaps by creating public developers, which build market-rate housing and then reinvest their proceeds into new construction (the left flank of the abundance movement has been popularizing the public developer model for years now).\n\nNevertheless, the private sector could produce far more housing than it does, were it not for regulatory restrictions. A freer housing market would therefore make America richer and more equal. This fact may make some progressives uncomfortable. But defending our favorite ideological abstractions should not take precedence over improving people’s lives.\n\nRelated The housing movement is divided against itself\n\nNot all environmental regulations are worth defending\n\nMost controversially, abundance liberals argue that some environmental regulations are undermining shared prosperity, trust in government, and the green transition.\n\nTheir complaint is not with environmental laws that directly constrain pollution, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act. The issue lies primarily with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its state-level equivalents. NEPA does not actually ban any pollutant or set any specific constraints on industrial production. Rather, the law mandates a process: Federal bureaucracies need to consider the environmental impact of their decisions, and draft statements outlining those impacts.\n\nAs Dunkelman explains, the law was intended merely to encourage government agencies to contemplate ecological concerns before greenlighting various projects, not to reduce their autonomy over such decisions. But activist lawyers took an expansive interpretation of the statute: In their view, if the government’s environmental impact statement underestimated the ecological implications of a given project, then private citizens and community groups could sue to block that project in court. And a series of judicial rulings enshrined this interpretation of the law.\n\nMany states proceeded to draft their own versions of NEPA, some of which applied its requirements to private projects as well as public ones. The effect was to render economic development of all kinds slower and more expensive. To ward off litigation, governments were forced to make their environmental impact statements lengthy and exhaustive: When the law was first enacted, those statements were as short as 10 pages. In 2022, the average one ran 600 pages long and took four and a half years to complete.\n\nAnd once completed, those statements still need to make it through a legal gauntlet before the ground on a given project can actually be broken.\n\nAll this has made building infrastructure in the US radically more expensive. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the cost of building a mile of interstate highway in America tripled. Mass transit was similarly impacted. It cost New York $2.6 billion to construct each mile of its Second Avenue Subway. By contrast, at around the same time, social democratic Copenhagen built a rail line for just $323 million per mile, and Paris built one for $320 million per mile.\n\nNEPA and its state-level equivalents also inhibit housing construction: In Berkeley, California, locals delayed the building of new undergraduate dorms through a three-year-long lawsuit, in which they argued that the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act, since enabling more college students to live in Berkeley would increase noise pollution.\n\nThis state of affairs undermines trust in the public sector’s competence, while making infrastructure and housing more expensive, raising tax burdens, and slowing economic growth.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s complacency about these outcomes bespeaks an insensitivity to working-class priorities and interests. According to some leftwing narratives, Democrats took an ideological turn in the 1970s, one that led them to sacrifice the interests of blue-collar Americans to the pursuit of “growth at all costs.” But on some policy fronts, this gets the story backward. Democrats became less committed to economic growth in the seventies, largely because they started prioritizing educated middle-class people’s ideological and quality-of-life concerns over the material interests of working people.\n\nThe environmental movement of the 1970s was overwhelmingly comprised of economically comfortable college graduates, many of whom regarded economic growth as undesirable and unsustainable, a position rejected by the vast majority of working-class voters. As political scientist Ronald Inglehart showed, blue-collar Americans were much less likely than their more affluent compatriots to prioritize environmental concerns over economic ones.\n\nAnd working-class voters’ priorities were well-founded: The costs of a regulatory system biased toward stasis and scarcity are more burdensome for those who do not yet enjoy material security than for those who do. As civil rights icon and trade unionist Bayard Rustin lamented in 1976, “the vanguard of the environmental movement, themselves members largely of the upper classes, have often sought policies that are clearly detrimental, and in some cases—the growth controversy being the most significant example—destructive to the needs of those less better off.”\n\nMany of the environmental movement’s achievements were laudable, and greatly improved and extended the lives of ordinary Americans. And the harms of NEPA aren’t all attributable to earnest environmentalists: Well-heeled interests have exploited the law to obstruct all manner of economic development. Yet refusing to pare back the scope of NEPA and similar laws in light of such abuse was a choice — one that constrained economic opportunity and diminished the federal government’s capacity to build public works.\n\nWhat makes NEPA and its ilk particularly perverse in the present moment, however, is that they are making America’s greatest ecological challenge — climate change — more difficult to meet.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: Building a clean energy economy requires constructing gargantuan amounts of new infrastructure (vast solar installations, wind farms, transmission lines, and geothermal plants, among other things). Maintaining a carbon economy, by contrast, requires building scarcely any, since the existing energy system is built around the needs and capacities of fossil fuels. A regulatory regime that favors the status quo is therefore one that favors fossil fuels. As of 2021, NEPA reviews were holding up twice as many green projects as carbon energy ones. According to an analysis cited by Klein and Thompson, 95 percent of energy projects that are looking to connect to the grid — but which are as yet obstructed by permitting — consist of solar, battery storage, or wind power.\n\nThe abundance agenda is a starting point\n\nPro-growth deregulatory policies are not sufficient for achieving shared prosperity. Indeed, such proposals aren’t even adequate for realizing Klein and Thompson’s vision for “abundance,” which also entails increasing government funding for technological development, among other things.\n\nBut loosening some regulatory restrictions on housing and infrastructure development would directly advance many progressive economic goals — while indirectly making it easier to expand the social welfare state. After all, higher economic growth translates into higher government revenues, which can then be redistributed to the economically disadvantaged. The abundance agenda is also compatible with increasing workers’ bargaining power through sectoral bargaining (even as there exist some genuine conflicts between the narrow interests of discrete unions and the achievement of material plenty).\n\nAbundance is directed at a progressive audience and aimed at winning an argument internal to blue America. In the current moment, this may strike some readers as myopic. Even if all progressives decided tomorrow to prioritize making it easier for the federal government to do big things, Elon Musk would still be gutting its capacity to execute its most basic functions. Even if permitting issues weren’t stymying the green transition, Donald Trump would be.\n\nAnd Klein and Thompson do not fully grapple with the challenge that the GOP’s radicalization poses to their ambitions. Much of the abundance agenda is aimed at increasing the administrative state’s power, at the expense of the judiciary’s. This strikes me as indispensable for realizing liberalism’s long-term goals. But today, it would entail giving Trump and Musk an even freer hand to reshape government to their reactionary whims.\n\nNevertheless, abundance liberalism remains relevant. The MAGA movement is not the reason why New York can’t build enough housing, California can’t build high-speed rail, and Massachusetts can’t build a transmission line between its cities and Quebec’s hydropower plants. Democrats have full control of government in some of America’s largest and wealthiest states. They have the power to prove that they can deliver rising living standards and falling costs for ordinary people.\n\nThere are many reasons why blue states have had such limited success on these fronts. But one is that progressives have not mounted a unified front against zoning restrictions that help landlords gouge tenants, environmental laws that enable rich NIMBYs to block renewable energy, and liberal policies that seek to advance so many disparate priorities that they end up achieving none. With any luck, Abundance will bring us a little closer to such a consensus.",

Satellite internet’s major advantage is that, with a few exceptions, it can work almost anywhere on the planet. Its drawbacks — including slow speeds, high latency, and spotty reliability — mean that fiber internet is better for the vast majority of people right now.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meanwhile granted Starlink a waiver that will make its new service, which lets phones connect to satellites, more powerful, as satellite competitors urged the agency to rein in Musk’s company, which they say is “anticompetitive.”\n\nMusk affiliates have also reportedly instructed government agencies to start using Starlink. The White House is now using Starlink “donated” by the company “to improve internet access on the campus,” according to the New York Times, and the General Services Administration has also been using the service, apparently without oversight. SpaceX confirmed that it’s leasing Starlink kits to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), amid reports that the agency might cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink instead. The company denied that it was trying to take over the contract.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake here, but this isn’t just about the money. (Musk doesn’t really need it.) Some people are worried that these developments represent the early steps of a power shift in the telecom industry, one that could result in the world’s richest man deciding how the nation’s communications network works.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation.”\n\nIn addition to hacking away at the federal government in his unelected position as the head of DOGE, Musk could also become the single individual who is “the dominant force in telecom policy,” according to Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and former chief of staff at the FCC. What’s more, the US telecommunications system is key to national security, and Musk’s business interests might not always line up with Washington’s.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation,” Levin said. “It’s very troubling.”\n\nSome of this must sound hyperbolic. It’s also hypothetical — for now. I’ve been writing about Starlink since before it launched its first batch of satellites in 2019, and from bringing remote parts of the world online to connecting Ukrainian soldiers at war, there’s no doubt that the technology is incredible.\n\nBut if recent events are any indication, the Trump administration plans to advantage Starlink in ways that benefit Musk more than the people who need better internet service. It also opens the door for Musk to become a much bigger power broker in the telecom world — and have more of a say in how you get online.\n\nElon’s space internet is not better than Earth internet yet\n\nIt’s tempting to think Starlink is the future of internet service. It’s very easy to set up, which is a huge deal to anyone who lacks broadband access — soldiers in Ukraine, for example, or farmers in rural America. But Starlink is not the same as the fiber-based broadband that’s become the gold standard for internet access.\n\nFor a number of reasons, space internet isn’t as fast, as reliable, or as cheap as terrestrial broadband. That’s why Congress prioritized companies that lay fiber-optic cable with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which provides federal funding to bring high-speed internet access to as many as 8 million Americans who have never had it, as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick now wants to make the program “technology neutral,” a change that would increase Starlink’s chances of getting grants. Whereas Musk’s company was on track to receive a little over $4 billion under the old rules, Starlink could now get between $10 billion and $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the Commerce Department goes through with the proposed changes to the BEAD program, its implementation would be delayed — more than one expert told me it would be by at least a year. Which is ironic given that Republicans made delays in BEAD’s rollout a talking point during the 2024 election. This process involves digging miles of trenches for tubes of cables that connect far-flung parts of the country. It takes time and costs money, but this infrastructure would last for decades.\n\n“It is truly a historic opportunity to get fiber to a lot of these places,” Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told me. “We’ll probably never have another opportunity like this.”\n\nStarlink dishes are easy to set up, but they don’t offer the same speed and reliability as fiber. Cate Dingley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome argue that Starlink and other satellite-based internet companies could get people online more quickly and without the expense of laying fiber. Starlink already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit and is trying to add more. But it’s unclear how quickly Starlink could actually add more users, since the company already has a waiting list for people to sign up because its network is at capacity.\n\nThat’s not to mention the fact that, for now, Starlink is neither faster nor cheaper than terrestrial broadband. Starlink delivers download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, while the FCC defines broadband as 100 Mbps. The average download speed in the US is about 275 Mbps. Starlink also currently charges customers $80 a month for its “Residential Lite” service, while the average US internet bill is $78 a month.\n\nThis is what makes the Trump administration’s apparent preferential treatment of Musk’s company so frustrating. It’s a poorer solution that takes longer and doesn’t result in savings for most Americans.\n\nMusk posts Starlink into the FAA\n\nWe don’t yet know how things will shake out with BEAD. The Commerce Department could change its mind, and the broadband infrastructure expansion could break ground in a few states this spring. However, the Trump administration is already starting to use Starlink in unusual ways.\n\nThe FAA, like many federal government agencies, is dealing with massive staff cuts at the behest of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Just days after 67 people died in a midair collision near Washington’s Reagan Airport, Musk’s staff urged FAA staffers to accept buyout offers, which more than 1,300 of them did, according to The Atlantic. DOGE also ended up firing about 400 FAA employees. When Musk’s team tried to lay off air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy finally intervened.\n\nRelated The year space internet takes off\n\nAt the same time — and operating on orders from Musk himself — a SpaceX engineer started to deploy Starlink technology on FAA systems. Musk posted on X that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly,” that “the situation is extremely dire,” and that he would send Starlink dishes to the rescue. The FAA has since confirmed that it’s reviewing the $2.4 billion Verizon contract and testing Starlink equipment at several locations, including in Alaska, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\nMusk’s posting-fueled intervention at the FAA is a scary one. Almost single-handedly, the billionaire threw cold water on a contract with Verizon, one that will affect the safety and security of Americans. Although it’s not clear if Starlink will indeed take over this particular contract, we have a glimpse at what it looks like for a singular bureaucrat — one that sells satellite dishes that don’t always work — to call the shots.\n\n“If you’re downloading stuff to your house in a rural area, and your speed drops because the system is oversubscribed, that’s annoying,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge. “If you’re the FAA, and your speed drops because the capacity is oversubscribed, that’s deadly.”\n\nProject 2025’s surprising role in all this\n\nElon Musk and DOGE, which is run by employees of Musk’s companies, certainly appear to be operating within the federal government to promote the best interests of those companies. The “why” of it all will take some time to figure out. Less than two months into Trump’s second presidency, we’re too busy keeping track of what’s even happening, especially where Musk is involved.\n\nAs for Starlink and Elon Musk’s apparent ambitions to dominate the US telecom industry, the FCC’s cooperation is essential. And Brendan Carr, the agency’s new chair, happens to be a big Elon Musk fan. Carr first made contact with Musk on X, where the two exchanged complaints about Democrats denying Starlink broadband subsidies and blamed Kamala Harris for rolling BEAD out too slowly. Carr was also the author of the chapter on the FCC for the big report published by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In it, he argues against terrestrial broadband expansion and in favor of accelerating the development of satellite technology, like Starlink.\n\nStarlink constellations look spectacular after they launch, but each satellite only lasts five years in orbit. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nOne of Project 2025’s main goals is to “dismantle the administrative state,” and in Musk, the right found a key ally. Musk has also found an opportunity: When the bureaucrats are all fired, someone still has to make decisions, and it’s easier to move quickly without any oversight.\n\nAcross the world, people are setting Tesla dealerships on fire to protest Musk’s gutting of the federal workforce and hoping to tank its stock. But what’s happening more quietly with Starlink, the Commerce Department, and the FCC shows that the multibillionaire isn’t just interested in making money. He’s consolidating power in Washington and helping determine what the future will look like.\n\nSelling cars is one thing, but taking control over America’s telecommunications network is another. Musk is not there yet, but we have already seen Musk use Starlink specifically to intervene in military operations abroad — he prevented Ukraine from launching a surprise attack against Russia in 2022. That sets a scary precedent for what the future holds.\n\n“Elon Musk has been pretty cavalier about his ability to turn on or turn off Starlink to influence policy decisions,” Garner, from the Benton Institute, told me, referring to a series of recent posts on X from Musk about cutting off Starlink access in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s not just scary that Musk is becoming more powerful in the telecom industry. It is uniquely terrifying that he alone could decide to bring networks down. And that might be an even more important development to keep our eyes on than the Tesla ad he produced in front of the White House.\n\nUpdate, March 18, 9:45 am ET: This story was originally published March 12 and has been updated to include news of the White House’s use of Starlink.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a staff writer for The Atlantic and the author of Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change .\n\nIf I ever need a reminder that I’m not a natural extrovert, I need only to look at the journal I kept during the early days of my improv classes. “I am having incredible dread about improv tomorrow,” I wrote one day. “I would literally pay any amount to get out of this class,” I moaned on another. “You can’t be bad at improv, but I feel like I am bad at improv,” I wrote after a class during which I gave up in the middle of a game called Big Booty and said simply, “I can’t take this anymore.”\n\nI had enrolled in improv because I was trying to become more extroverted, as part of a sweeping personality-change project that I document in my new book, Me, But Better. Extroversion is one of the “big five” personality traits that scientists say make up a person’s disposition, along with openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Extroversion is associated with socializing and cheerfulness, and as a hardened introvert, I knew I needed a mechanism to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. Improv seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.\n\nThese perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nBut it wasn’t going well, and at times, I thought about dropping the class or giving up altogether. Even after I got better at improv, I still felt nervous before every class. And the other activities I was doing to boost my extroversion — like going on long hikes with strangers — were only mildly pleasant, at best. I had this notion that, since I was an introvert, I should avoid difficult social situations like, well, improv class.\n\nI’m glad I didn’t give up, though. It turns out that behaving in an extroverted way can have surprising benefits, even if you’re an introvert. And these perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nWhat spurts of extroversion can do for introverts\n\nCompared to introverts, extroverts are happier, research unfortunately shows. An exhaustingly chirpy series of studies has found that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of well-being, and extroverts are more socially connected. In lab experiments, extroverts tend to interpret ambiguous stimuli more positively, hearing the word “won” rather than “one,” for example, or writing more uplifting short stories based on generic prompts. People who are extroverted as teenagers remain happier even when they’re 60.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI understand that introverts might not be thrilled to hear this — I wasn’t, either. But Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist who has studied this phenomenon, says it’s worth focusing less on the “extrovert” part of this and more on the fact that these individuals are more enmeshed in community. “Connection is really the key to happiness,” Lyubomirsky told me. And there are ways to square your natural introversion with the universal human need for connection. You don’t have to mingle with everyone at the office party, for instance. You can just call a trusted friend for a one-on-one conversation. Even hanging out with others and listening more than you talk can be a form of “extroversion,” Lyubomirsky says.\n\nOne surprising thing Introverts may believe that behaving like extroverts means going against their nature — but this doesn’t bother us as much as we might think. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts.\n\nWhile it’s true that extroverts enjoy talking, people, and attention, they also enjoy activity, period. Therefore, to boost your own levels of extroversion, you can just sign up for an activity — in addition to improv, I tried sailing — and commit to going, even if you don’t plan to talk much.\n\nThough there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert, several studies have shown that when introverts occasionally behave in extroverted ways, they experience more “positive affect” — science-speak for good feelings. “I started doing these studies because I didn’t believe them,” says John Zelenski, a psychology professor at Carleton University who has replicated this finding, and who himself is introverted. But “it absolutely seems correct that if you get people to act extroverted — and usually, that means socializing for a few minutes — there’s a big mood boost there.”\n\nThe reason for this twist is that behaving against our natures doesn’t bother us as much as we fear it might. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts. That’s because, much as we might prize authenticity, we have other desires, too. We want to handle difficult situations appropriately, feel embraced by others, and accomplish our goals — and most of us also want to feel happier and more connected. Sometimes, achieving those things means going against our “natural” personality traits.\n\n“Lots of things that we may not initially like doing actually really benefit us,” says Lyubomirsky, who, as an example, offered that she now loves running but took a while to get into it. “A lot of things in life don’t feel natural at first. … Just because it doesn’t feel comfortable and natural doesn’t mean it’s not authentic.” Authenticity can come from familiarity, and the only way to build familiarity is through experience.\n\nA desire to remain “authentic” is one reason people may balk at the idea of changing themselves — either through personality change or otherwise. But living authentically can also mean acting in ways that feel, at first, uncomfortable, as long as those actions draw you closer to your values and goals. Many of us, if we followed the North Star of “authenticity,” would quit our jobs, neglect our families, and watch Love Is Blind all day. But what is instinctive is not always best.\n\nThis doesn’t mean behaving like an extrovert constantly, just occasionally. I told Zelenski about a time I had to collect “man on the street” interviews as a reporter — a horrible task that involves approaching random strangers and lobbing questions at them in an attempt to find a pattern of responses for your story. One freezing cold night in New Jersey, I didn’t conceal my misery well enough. As I mangled my words and rubbed my hands together, one woman looked at me with pity and said, “Don’t worry, you’re almost done.”\n\n“After a while, it does get old,” Zelenski acknowledged.\n\nHow to coax out your inner extrovert\n\nTo figure out how to get better at these forays into extroversion, I called up Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK. More importantly for my purposes, she talks to strangers — on the street, on vacation, even in the sacred space of the London Tube. She researches the power of “weak ties,” casual acquaintances with whom we interact, but usually only briefly. People who have lots of weak ties, who make eye contact and idle chitchat with baristas and neighbors, feel happier than those who don’t, her studies find.\n\nInitially, her research felt alien to me. I had stopped working in an office when the pandemic started, and I didn’t miss it at all. I live in the suburbs, so I don’t interact with many people unless I make a point to — and I usually don’t.\n\nSandstrom told me she’s the same way: She’s an introvert and tends to avoid demanding social situations. But she uses talking to strangers as a coping mechanism of sorts. If she’s in a big, crowded room, she finds someone who’s off by themselves and starts a one-on-one conversation.\n\nOne way to open such a conversation is by making a statement, rather than asking a question. For instance, when Sandstrom is on public transportation, she’ll test the waters by complimenting the person sitting next to her. (She recommends remarking on something other than their looks.) Or, she’ll comment on something in the environment — if they have a suitcase, she’ll ask where they’re going. One time, she was walking in a park and noticed a man smiling at some ducks. “Aren’t they cute?” Sandstrom said. She and the man ended up chatting for half an hour, since they were walking in the same direction. At the end of her conversations, Sandstrom just says something like, “Thank you, it’s been nice talking to you,” and walks off.\n\nJust like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nI told Sandstrom that I don’t miss my weak ties much, and I’m not really one for small talk. We either have to get to the bottom of your childhood trauma, or we’re not talking at all. The thing is, she pointed out, most weak ties probably aren’t going to become long-term relationships. I needed to set the stakes way lower. Her conversations tend to last just a few minutes, and sometimes, they’re nothing special. But just like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nOver time, these weak ties do benefit us, even if we don’t especially notice them. They make us feel woven into the social fabric, Sandstrom says, like we’re part of something bigger. “When I do talk to people, I feel better,” she told me. “It’s almost always at least an average experience.” And when a conversation is unusually engaging, “it feels awesome, because I wouldn’t expect there to be anything coming from it.”\n\nAs I sped home from my first improv class, I detected something that, honestly, floored me. I was smiling. Even though I would continue to dread it for months, something about the whole exercise was just so fun. I’m rarely immersed in something that’s meant to be light and exuberant, as opposed to correct or exacting. Because it was the middle of the pandemic, it had been months since I’d socialized with a group of people. The electricity of improv had invigorated me, in spite of myself.",

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nLast summer, I quit Spotify, and wrote about it with the rather unsubtle headline “Why I quit Spotify.” My reasons remain sound: The software had become clunky, the ads relentless, and the Sabrina Carpenter songs too inescapable. I wanted to find a better music streaming service. It gives me no pleasure to report that a few weeks ago, I rejoined.\n\nThe algorithm got me. I don’t just mean that it got me, the way the TikTok algorithm glues you to the screen. Spotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock or ongoing obsession with French touch music from the mid-Aughts. It took a few months of digging through the proverbial crates of Apple Music for me to realize that Spotify has something other streaming services could never get: 15 years of my music listening habits and artificially intelligent software to reinforce those habits.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nSpotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock.\n\nQuitting and unquitting Spotify made me realize something, though. As central as algorithmic feeds are to how you consume information, you have more control over how those algorithms shape your tastes and behavior than you might think.\n\nIf an algorithm works for you — as Spotify’s does for me — don’t feel bad about submitting to its effortless and convenient offerings.\n\nLean-forward listening\n\nMusic has always been important to me, and over the years, it started to feel like I had to gamify Spotify to find songs that I truly loved. When Spotify launched in 2011, it was basically a massive library of all the music, but over the years, it introduced more and more algorithmic recommendations and playlists that promised to match my taste. It still took work to find the good stuff.\n\nThis work is what has now made Spotify’s algorithms irreplaceable to me. It has a decade-and-a-half of my listening history, and over the years, I’ve learned its quirks and tinkered with it to meet my needs. I spent months trying to replicate this experience on Apple Music, but its algorithms struggled to surprise me.\n\nRelated Why I quit Spotify\n\nAll music streaming algorithms operate on two basic principles: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The content-based filtering tries to identify specific aspects of a song itself, including the artist, genre, mood, and so forth, to queue up the next song. Collaborative filtering refers to recommendations made based on other people who listen to a certain song and what else they listen to. If two people listen to the same five songs, there’s a good chance they’ll both like this sixth song. It’s all math, and sometimes there are anomalies that will delight you.\n\n“Some of the serendipity that you get is sort of error turned into virtue,” Glenn McDonald, a former data alchemist at Spotify and creator of Every Noise at Once, told me. “So you’re surprised, and sometimes those surprises are pleasant.”\n\nIt’s not just that Spotify’s recommendations tend to be pleasant because it has a lot of data about me. It’s that Spotify has the listening history of 675 million people, whose interests may overlap with mine in countless different ways. Over the years, I’ve developed a set of habits that help me hone those recommendations — things like making playlists, rejecting recommendations I don’t like, exploring artists’ catalogs, and maybe most importantly, digging through other people’s playlists.\n\nThis is what I call lean-forward listening. While it’s easy enough to click on Discover Weekly every Monday, lean back and listen to the whole thing like a radio show, and then move on to the next playlist, the more effort you put into curating your experience, the better the algorithms will work next time. At the very least, you’ll find your way onto a playlist that algorithms didn’t create.\n\nHow to resist algorithmic rule\n\nLike them or not, algorithmic recommendations aren’t going anywhere. Companies like Spotify like them because — when they work — algorithms keep people hooked on their products. Companies like Amazon like them because algorithmic recommendations enable them to steer people’s behavior. The right product recommendation could lead someone to buy something they didn’t otherwise plan on buying. (We’ve all done it.)\n\nYou can probably learn to live with it when you’re talking about music on Spotify or burrito restaurants on DoorDash. “The stakes are a little bit higher when it comes to recommending things like products on Amazon, and even higher when it comes to recommending things like content on Facebook,” said Meredith Broussard, a data journalism professor at New York University. “Because, as we all know, disinformation and misinformation are very, very popular, but not good.”\n\nThe role algorithms, which are designed to boost engagement, play in spreading misinformation is a book-length topic. For now, I’ll just reiterate that you don’t have to lean back and let Facebook, Google, or X flood you with algorithmically generated information. You can learn more about how these platforms use algorithms and steer them to your advantage.\n\nIf you’re sick of the algorithm on X feeding you right-wing propaganda, try Bluesky, which lets you pick different algorithms for your feed. And if Netflix or any other streaming service has gotten stale, try nuking your view history and starting over. Spotify offers a list of details about how it recommends content and how you can make tweaks. And Amazon has a tool that’s designed to improve your recommendations. (I have tried all of these things, including the Amazon tool, which is very tedious but still possibly helpful.)\n\nThings get a little tougher on big platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, whose algorithms tend toward the black box end of the spectrum. Still, knowing how algorithms work and playing an active role in making them work better for you can improve your experience on almost any platform. Algorithms are only in charge if you let them be.\n\nIn some cases, you might like it when the algorithm’s in charge. This is how I generally feel on Spotify, although I’m constantly correcting it and guiding it. This is also how I generally feel on Amazon, where I try to buy only the basics. I quit Instagram a while ago when I decided the algorithm was in charge a little too much. If I get bored one day, I might try it again.",

Each narrates a section of the novel, the two extroverts in first person and the introverts in third person, as one by one they consider the men in their lives who have loved them and betrayed them.\n\nThey’re thinking about their body counts, says one character toward the end of the novel.

All were betrayed by men who at their worst behaved like animals and at their best were simply not enough to build a life around. Instead, as the novel goes on, they find they’ve built their lives around each other.\n\nDream Count is not a perfect novel, but it offers you the kind of fully textured polyphonic female friendship that only Adichie can render so beautifully and precisely. As we make our way through the end of Women’s History Month, here are three other recent books that offer us portraits of women in complicated, visceral detail.\n\nOn the shelf\n\nThree Days in June by Anne Tyler\n\nThree Days in June is a slim novel of enormous warmth and sweetness, featuring one of the prickly, closed-off women Anne Tyler writes so well. Gail, a 61-year-old assistant headmistress at a private girl’s school, finds herself getting pushed out of her job with the explanation that she lacks people skills. Gail is outraged: No one, she tells us, had ever said such a thing about her before, or at least “Not in so many words.”\n\nBut Gail’s ex-boss has a point. Gail nitpicks grammar, clothes, the way other people chew their food. She cuts her own hair so she doesn’t have to make small talk with the stylist. She doesn’t particularly enjoy most people and isn’t particularly good at dealing with them.\n\nNever mind: Gail doesn’t have the time to spend too long mourning her lost job. Her daughter is getting married the next day, and Gail’s ex-husband and his cat show up on her doorstep looking for lodging for the wedding. Before long, so does the bride, who suspects the groom of infidelity. Sour, crotchety Gail has to keep things together, which she does with mingled affection and annoyance for everyone around her. The results will melt your heart.\n\nNo Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek\n\nHaley Mlotek began dating her future husband when she was 16 years old, she tells us in this tender, shivery, shadowy memoir-cum-cultural history. They stayed together, surprised as anyone else that things seemed to keep working out for them, for 12 years, and eventually got married for immigration purposes. A year after their wedding, they divorced.\n\nMlotek never tells us directly what led to her divorce, or of what the end looked like. Instead, she circles around abstractions of events, while her descriptions of how it all felt land with shocking emotional intensity. “I could tell you about our last night,” she writes of the end of the marriage, “but mostly I think about how the night passed no matter what we did to hold still.”\n\nMlotek seeds details of her own divorce through a larger cultural history of the divorce plot. Feverishly, she explores memoirs, novels, movies, looking at how the divorce plot mirrors and subverts three centuries of marriage plots. The bibliography Mlotek builds can feel generic in comparison to the specificity of her own experiences, but occasionally she hits gold — as with her long analysis of The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd, a 1970s documentary about a couple who filmed their wedding, wedding night, and subsequent divorce, and then watch and discuss the whole thing on public access television.\n\n“I have looked for guidance everywhere but real life,” Mlotek tells us. “I want you to ask if I’ve read Anna Karenina. I do not want you to ask what I would do for love.” She’s nonetheless at her most compelling when she’s implying the answer to the second question.\n\nWoodworking by Emily St. James\n\nIf you’ve been reading Vox for a while, you might recognize Emily St. James’s name. She’s an institution here. She founded Vox’s culture section (and hired yours truly) and, as our critic-at-large, wrote some of the most insightful cultural criticism you’re likely to find anywhere. Now, she’s written her first novel, Woodworking. I am obviously biased (all the more so because the book contains a character named Constance; Emily tells me there is no relation), but I think you’ll love it.\n\nIn the 1980s, “woodworking” was trans slang for going deep, deep stealth: transitioning, getting bottom surgery, and cutting off contact with anyone who ever knew you pre-transition, so that no one could ever say you were anything but cis. You simply fade into the woodwork.\n\nIn this snappy, propulsive novel, woodworking remains far, far out of reach for Erica, one of the book’s two narrators. She’s a 35-year-old English teacher in small-town South Dakota in 2016, and she has only recently allowed herself to realize that she is trans. Erica is also more than half convinced that it’s too late for her to do anything about it. She has already gone through puberty, and already built a whole life as a man. If she transitions, Erica tells herself, she will lose her job and her life, and she will never even be able to pass, let alone woodwork, so what’s the point?\n\nWoodworking remains an aspiration for teenage Abigail, our second narrator and the only other trans person Erica knows of in Mitchell, South Dakota. Having already fled her anti-trans parents, Abigail is biding her time until she can afford to pay for bottom surgery, cut off her beloved sister, move to a city, and woodwork.\n\nWhen Abigail realizes that her dorky English teacher is trans and closeted, she is disgusted to find that she’s the only one in a position to guide said teacher through those early, fumbling days of transitioning. She buys Erica nail polish, shows her how to put it on, and convinces her to wear the polish to school. Erica wonders if she is a lesbian because she’s still attracted to her ex-wife; Abigail assures her that she is the most lesbian.\n\nSt. James writes with a breezy charm, especially in dialogue, but the playfulness of her voice belies the darkness running under this novel. Abigail tells her story in a defensive first person that occasionally lifts right out of her body; Erica, meanwhile, has dissociated into the third person as she tells her story, redacting her dead name with a hazy gray bar. These characters are living during the election of 2016, and they can tell that right-wing animus against them is mounting. They don’t know just how dark things will get eight years later.\n\nOff the shelf",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent for Vox, where she covers American family life, work, and education. Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump’s biggest targets in his second term has been the Education Department, a federal agency established in 1979 that oversees the enforcement of federal law in schools. He’s called the department “a big con job,” and expressed his hope that Linda McMahon, confirmed on March 3 to head the agency, will “put herself out of a job.” On March 20, he finally signed a long-expected executive order directing McMahon to dismantle the department.\n\nTrump cannot legally close the Education Department without cooperation from Congress. (During her confirmation hearing, McMahon agreed that congressional action would be necessary, and said some programs would continue.) But the administration has already started making massive changes. In early March, the department announced the layoffs of more than 1,300 workers, bringing the agency to about half the size it was when Trump took office, according to the New York Times. The department’s Office of Civil Rights, which enforces federal disability law and anti-discrimination protections in schools, faced especially stark cuts. McMahon said in a Fox News interview on March 11 that the layoffs were part of Trump’s plan for the department: “His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education.”\n\nIn an email to the department just after her confirmation, McMahon called on staffers to “join us in this historic final mission,” which she described as “a last chance to restore the culture of liberty and excellence that made American education great.”\n\nThe Education Department’s critics misrepresent it as a tool for the federal government to exert control over schools. It’s actually an agency tasked with supporting the nation’s most underserved students while also overseeing the massive and complex ecosystem of federal student loans — and disrupting those functions could affect students and families across the country.\n\nWhat the Education Department does\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what the Education Department doesn’t do. It does not set K-12 curricula or tell schools what to teach. That’s up to states and individual districts. So when Trump says he wants to get rid of the Education Department in order to send education “back to the states,” it’s somewhat misleading, because state and local governments are already in charge of what kids learn in schools.\n\nWhat the department does do is “implement all of the federal laws and policies that focus on schools,” said Dominique Baker, a professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware. At the K-12 level, a lot of that work involves supporting vulnerable and underserved students, said Kenneth Wong, a professor of education policy at Brown University.\n\nUnder a program known as Title I, the department sends federal money to schools with a high percentage of low-income students to help them hire additional teachers or otherwise bolster core subject areas like reading, Wong said. The federal government makes up about 14 percent of school budgets overall, according to the Associated Press, but low-income schools receive additional funding.\n\nThe department also sends money to states under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), helping schools provide small class sizes and other supports for students with disabilities and learning differences that state governments wouldn’t be able to afford on their own.\n\nWhile these programs are important to many elementary, middle, and high schools around the country, the Education Department plays an even bigger role with colleges and universities, Baker said. It makes sure the application for federal financial aid, the FAFSA, is available to students, that the information students enter is sent to colleges, and that the money is actually disbursed.\n\nThe department also helps make sure that for-profit colleges “aren’t scamming students,” Baker said, by controlling which institutions get access to federal student aid.\n\nTwo other key functions to know about: The Education Department serves as a “watchdog for student civil rights” at K-12 schools and colleges, said Blair Wriston, senior manager for government affairs at EdTrust, an education equity nonprofit. If students with disabilities aren’t getting the support they need to access their legal right to an education — supports that can range from wheelchair ramps to occupational therapy to a one-on-one aide — their families can file a complaint with the department’s Office of Civil Rights. Students and families can also file with the office if they believe they’ve experienced racial discrimination at school.\n\nAnd through the Institute of Education Sciences, the department conducts research on education around the country, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests, probably the best source of nationwide data on students’ reading and math skills. “The vast majority of any statistics that we know about schooling comes from data that’s collected by the federal government,” Baker said.\n\nWhat the Trump administration is doing\n\nTrump cannot fully eliminate the Education Department without help from Congress, and while legislation to do so has been introduced, it’s unlikely to pass the closely divided House and Senate. The administration has discussed moving some parts of the department to other agencies — Project 2025, a blueprint for much of the Trump administration’s actions thus far, calls for converting Title I funds into grants to the states, and moving the Office of Civil Rights to the Department of Justice.\n\nUntil the executive order on March 20, the administration’s approach has mostly been to shrink the department through layoffs and other cuts. In February, DOGE terminated dozens of contracts at the Institute of Education Sciences. Though the cuts reportedly didn’t affect the NAEP tests, much of the work of the Institute “has ground to a standstill,” Baker said.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 2,000 department employees have left or been terminated since Trump took office, including 1,315 in the mass layoffs on March 11, 63 probationary workers laid off in February, and 572 who accepted voluntary buyouts, according to the New York Times. The department had about 4,133 staffers when Trump took office; it now has fewer than 2,200.\n\nEven prior to the executive order, the Trump administration and DOGE were “actively dismantling the department,” Wriston said.\n\nHow gutting the Education Department hurts students\n\nThat dismantling is having an effect on students. As soon as Trump was inaugurated, the department’s processing of disability rights complaints ground to a halt, families told the Associated Press. That left students — including a 12-year-old boy with autism and epilepsy who’s been unwillingly assigned to remote schooling — without recourse and, in some cases, losing precious weeks of learning. The agency resumed processing disability cases in mid-February, but cases involving race and gender discrimination remain on hold, according to USA Today.\n\nInstead, the department has focused on trans athletes and all-gender bathrooms. The agency also sent a letter to school leaders saying they could face investigation if they take steps to diversify their teaching staff or recruit students of color for selective programs, according to Chalkbeat.\n\nLayoffs at the Office of Civil Rights could further hamper the department’s ability to handle disability and other discrimination cases. The office already had a backlog of such cases under the Biden administration, the Times reported.\n\nMeanwhile, cuts at the Institute of Education Sciences include programs addressing young children’s literacy and improving the transition out of high school for students with disabilities, Wriston said. Dismantling the Institute is especially ironic at a time of nationwide concern over declining NAEP scores, he said. “We’re going to gut the agency completely that’s doing the real work here of gathering the research and evidence to help inform our practices,” he said.\n\nWithout the data the institute collects, it will also be more difficult for taxpayers to see the impact that cuts by the federal government might have on kids’ education, Baker said.\n\nAt the college level, meanwhile, experts fear a breakdown in the basic systems that allow students to apply for, use, and repay their student loans. Without a functioning Education Department, it’s not clear how students’ financial information will be collected and sent to universities for financial aid decisions, or who will certify borrowers’ income for income-based repayment plans, Baker said. The department already struggled with the rollout of a new FAFSA last year, and given canceled contracts and other changes under the new administration, “I don’t know why anyone would expect smooth sailing next year,” Baker said.\n\nGutting the research and oversight functions of the department could also make it easier for colleges to lie to students about their graduation rates and the success of their graduates, experts say.\n\nOver the long term, parceling out programs like Title I and IDEA to other departments — each with their own functions and priorities — could weaken those programs’ ability to serve the high-needs students they were created to support, Wong said. The Education Department is (or was) full of experts who have spent their careers serving students, and other departments simply won’t have the same expertise. And, of course, those other departments are also on the chopping block in the DOGE era, Wriston pointed out.\n\nAs Trump and DOGE move forward with their plans, advocates and voters can respond by “elevating the stories and the perspectives of impacted communities, of families and students and educators who are being impacted by this,” Wriston said. “Those perspectives are critical right now.”\n\nWhile students and families are the most directly impacted by changes at the Education Department, those changes have also inspired a broader concern. Some of the programs terminated by DOGE are congressionally mandated, and if the president or Musk can simply stop them, “that means that Congress no longer actually functions,” Baker said.\n\n“There are no longer checks and balances for the executive branch,” Baker said. “A significant part of this goes beyond education and speaks to a constitutional crisis that shapes the future of our country.”\n\nUpdate, March 20, 4:40 pm ET: This story was originally published on March 4 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to reflect Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department.",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

He's a senior fellow and director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThanks for being with us.\n\nAnd you wrote in a column recently that you think, in principle, downsizing the Education Department makes sense. Let's start there. Why do you think an overhaul is called for?\n\nRick Hess, Director of Education Policy Studies, American Enterprise Institute: Sure.\n\nThere's a lot of confusion about what the department is. The best description is that it's a megabank with a small policy shop attached. The biggest thing the department does is manage about a $1.5 trillion portfolio in student loans. That's a disproportionate share of the work force.\n\nIn K-12, the two big programs are Title I for schools serving children of poverty and IDEA for children with special needs. Combined, those two programs are about $35 billion a year, which is about 3 cents on the dollar of what we spend in K-12 education.\n\nSo, look, we have got a lot of adults who aren't educators creating a lot of paperwork, costing a lot of money in salary and benefits in ways that frequently frustrate the ability of schools or colleges to serve kids. I think you can dramatically downsize that department, shrink the work force, reduce the red tape in ways that are good for learning and good for America's schools and colleges.",

I was one of the managers of our family-owned Sunset Restaurant in Glen Burnie, Maryland.\n\nOur family bought the business back in 1960. I started working there in 1989, and I was there for 32 years. Sunset Restaurant was a family-style restaurant that anyone could bring their folks in, young, old.\n\nWe had heard all this stuff going on in the news about the COVID stuff. And then the day before St. Patrick's Day, we were told, shut it down; 90 percent of our employees, we had to lay off. And after that, we had to rewrite the wheel on doing carryouts and food.\n\nAfter we opened back up, we were at 50 percent. We were losing $10,000 a month. So we brought the accountants in, and the accountants sat down with us and said: \"Guys, I'd close it up if I was you.\"\n\nIt was like someone just knocked me upside the head, knowing that something that I had always had my heart and soul into, all I had known was the Sunset all my life. As a child growing up, everything was that building. It was a lump in my throat.\n\nI think things were locked down too much, too fast, too soon without research. Now that I know what's going on, hindsight, money morning quarterback, it shows you that there's a lot of conspiracy going on with the governments. It shows that you can't always trust these guys.\n\nJanuary of '20, my father passed. And if he was still alive during this — all this COVID, it would have killed him. He really would have gotten very, very mad for the government to come in and shut you down for something that we really don't know, we don't understand. And you're stuck holding the bag.\n\nI blame the federal government. I blame Fauci. I blame all the bureaucrats at the National Institution of Health. Knowing what I know now, my opinion, knowing that I'm not a doctor, treat it like the normal flu. These guys are telling us to do this and to do that, stand six foot apart. Wear a mask.\n\nIt was all a bunch of hoo-ha. All things happen for a reason. It probably worked out better for my family. The guy that was selling us our insurance for the building came to me and said, hey, what are you going to do afterwards? You want to try selling insurance? Sure.\n\nSales are sales. I have been in sales for 40-plus years. So I wanted to try that. I will try that. And I have been doing that since. I'm not making a ton of money, but I'm making money. My life is easier. My life is more relaxed. I'm off every night and I'm off every weekend.\n\nI went out on Saturday and was playing golf with family members up here, and we were driving the tee. And I said: \"So, this is what it's like to be off on a Saturday.\" Never got to do it.\n\nI do not like going down to Glen Burnie, Maryland, anymore. It's kind of like bad blood. I just don't want to go back. It hurts. It hurts.",

A recently departed Social Security official who saw the DOGE team sweep into the agency said she is deeply worried about sensitive information being exposed.\n\nWATCH: Trump administration’s Social Security changes could limit access to benefits for millions\n\nThe Trump administration says DOGE has a 10-person team of federal employees at the Social Security Administration, seven of whom have been granted read-only access to agency systems or personally identifiable information.\n\nThe administration has said DOGE is targeting waste and fraud in the federal government.\n\nHollander, though, found that the ends may not justify the means.\n\n“The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion,” she wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government argued the DOGE access doesn’t deviate significantly from normal practices inside the agency, where employees are routinely allowed to search its databases. But attorneys for the plaintiffs called the access unprecedented.\n\nDOGE has gotten at least some access to other government databases, including at the Treasury Department and IRS.\n\nAt SSA, DOGE staffers swept into the agency days after Trump’s inauguration and pressed for a software engineer to quickly get access to data systems that are normally carefully restricted even within the government, a former official said in court documents.\n\nThe team appeared to be searching for fraud based on inaccuracies and misunderstandings, according to Tiffany Flick, the former acting chief of staff to the acting commissioner.\n\nHollander, who is based in Baltimore and was nominated by President Barack Obama, is the latest judge to consider a DOGE related case. The team has drawn nearly two dozen lawsuits, some of which have shed light on staffing and operations that have largely been kept under wraps.\n\nSeveral judges have raised questions about DOGE’s sweeping cost-cutting efforts, but they have not always agreed that the risks are imminent enough to block the team from government systems.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lea Skene in Baltimore contributed reporting.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Two purported mobsters were convicted Thursday of plotting to assassinate Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad at her home in New York City in a murder-for-hire scheme that prosecutors said was financed by Iran’s government.\n\nThe verdict was returned at a federal court in New York, ending a two-week trial that featured dramatic testimony from a hired gunman and Alinejad, an author, activist and contributor to Voice of America.\n\nWATCH: Activists in Iran describe the threats and oppression they face for protesting\n\nAlinejad, who was not in court, told The Associated Press she cried when she learned of the verdict.\n\n“I am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,” she said. “Right now I am bombarded with emotions. I have cried. I have laughed. I have even danced.”\n\nAlinejad called the verdict “a powerful gift from the American government” to the people of Iran because it shows that justice is beginning to be served.\n\nProsecutors said the convicted men, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, were crime bosses in the Russian mob. Their lawyers argued that they were innocent and trial evidence was flawed.\n\nAlinejad, 48, was targeted by Iran for her online campaigns encouraging women there to record videos of themselves exposing their hair in violation of edicts requiring they cover it in public.\n\nIran offered $500,000 for a July 2022 killing of Alinejad after efforts to harass, smear and intimidate her failed, prosecutors said.\n\nAmerican officials have accused Iran of backing several assassination plots in the United States, including against President Donald Trump when he was campaigning last year. Tehran has denied being behind any such plots.\n\nAlinejad testified last week that she came to the United States in 2009 after she was banned from covering Iran’s disputed presidential election and the newspaper where she worked was shut down.\n\nEstablishing herself in New York City, she built an online audience of millions and launched her “My Stealthy Freedom” campaign, telling Iranian women to send photos and videos exposing of them showing their hair when the morality police were not around.\n\nSoon, she said, she had inspired women to take to the streets in Iran on Wednesdays to peacefully protest, leading the government to arrest hundreds of them. The crackdown only caused her following to grow, however.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that by 2022, the Iranian government had enlisted organized crime figures including Amirov and Omarov to kill Alinejad.\n\nKhalid Mehdiyev, a former member of the Russian mob who lived Yonkers and worked at a pizzeria, testified that he was hired as the hitman. Like Amirov and Omarov, he is from Azerbaijan, which shares a border and cultural ties with Iran.\n\nMehdiyev, who cooperated with prosecutors after pleading guilty to multiple crimes, said he bought an AK-47 to kill Alinejad but the plan was foiled when his car was stopped by police and the gun was found in the back seat in July 2022. A doorbell camera at Alinejad’s home recorded Mehdiyev standing on her front porch.\n\nProsecutors have kept the investigation open. In October they announced charges against a senior Iranian military official and three others, none of whom are in custody.\n\nIn a separate case, U.S. prosecutors in 2022 charged a man in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with plotting to kill former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nIranian officials vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.\n\nAlinejad said she has had to move nearly two dozen times since the assassination plot was discovered, at times feeling guilty that so many of her followers in Iran lack a safety net.\n\nThat, she said, only “makes me more determined to give voice to voiceless people.”",

        "content": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s defense minister said Friday he has ordered ground forces to advance deeper into the Gaza Strip, vowing to hold more land until Hamas releases the remaining hostages it holds.\n\nAfter retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza’s north from south, Israeli troops moved Thursday toward the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah.\n\nREAD MORE: Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least 85 Palestinians\n\nThe military said it had resumed enforcing a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was delivered a setback in his attempt to fire the country’s domestic security chief. Hours after Netanyahu’s Cabinet unanimously approved the firing of Ronen Bar, the Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to his dismissal until an appeal can be heard.\n\nThe court said it was delaying the firing until an appeal could be heard no later than April 8. Netanyahu’s office had said Bar’s dismissal was effective April 10, but that it could come earlier if a replacement was found.\n\nIsrael’s attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.\n\nA Shin Bet report into Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that prompted the war acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said policies by Netanyahu’s government created the conditions for the attack.\n\nIn his comments about Gaza on Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said operations there would continue “with increasing intensity until the hostages are released by Hamas.”\n\n“The more Hamas continues its refusal to release the kidnapped, the more territory it will lose to Israel,” Katz said.\n\nThe decision to sack Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nIt also could set the stage for a crisis over the country’s division of powers. Israel’s attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.\n\nCritics say the move is a power grab by the prime minister against an independent-minded civil servant, and tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated in support of Bar, including outside Netanyahu’s residence on Friday.\n\nIn addition to its report on the Oct. 7 attack, Netanyahu is also upset that Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and the Gulf state of Qatar. His office said Bar’s dismissal would take effect on April 10 or before then if a replacement is found.\n\nNearly 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel on Tuesday shattered a truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.\n\nIsrael had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, has said it would escalate military operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive — and gives up control of the territory.\n\nThe ceasefire agreed to in mid-January was a three-phase plan meant to lead to a long-term cessation of hostilities, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas in its surprise attack on Israel.\n\nIn the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza.\n\nThe ceasefire was supposed to continue as long as talks on the second phase continued but Netanyahu balked at entering substantive negotiations.\n\nInstead, he tried to force Hamas to accept a new ceasefire plan put forth by U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nThat plan would have required Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.\n\nHamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the original ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe militant group has said it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.\n\nHamas said in a statement Friday that the firing of Shin Bet’s head shows a “deepening crisis of distrust” within Israel’s leadership, and claimed that Netanyahu “engineered sham negotiations to stall and buy time without any genuine intention of reaching tangible outcomes.”\n\nNetanyahu said he had ordered the resumed strikes on Gaza because of Hamas’ rejection of the new proposal.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reiterated its support for Israel this week, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “The president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.”\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nThe war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population and has caused vast destruction across the territory.\n\nRising reported from Bangkok; Mednick reported from Tel Aviv.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist has been released by the Taliban in a deal with the Trump administration that Qatari negotiators helped broker, the State Department said Thursday.\n\nGeorge Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, is the third American detainee to be released by the Taliban since January. He was seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services in December 2022 and was designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained the following year.\n\nREAD MORE: Taliban says 2 Americans held in Afghanistan freed in prisoner exchange\n\nIn a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Glezmann was on his way back to the United States to be reunited with his wife, Aleksandra, and praised Qatar for “steadfast commitment and diplomatic efforts” that he said were “instrumental in securing George’s release.”\n\n“George’s release is a positive and constructive step,” Rubio said. “It is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. President Trump will continue his tireless work to free ALL Americans unjustly detained around the world.”\n\nGlezmann was being accompanied back to the U.S., through Qatar’s capital, Doha, by Adam Boehler, who has been handling hostage issues for President Donald Trump’s administration. The Taliban disclosed earlier Thursday that Boehler had met with a delegation that included Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.\n\nGlezmann, 66, was in Afghanistan as a tourist at the time of his abduction and has visited more than 100 countries as part of his passion for exploring different cultures, according to a profile on the website of the Foley Foundation, an organization that advocates for the release of Americans detained by foreign countries.\n\nThe release of Glezmann is part of what the Taliban has previously described as the “normalization” of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Most countries still don’t recognize the Taliban’s rule.\n\nGlezmann’s release follows a separate deal, arranged in January in the final days of the Biden administration and also mediated by the Qataris, that secured the releases of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty.\n\nThe Taliban’s Foreign Ministry in Kabul said at the time that those two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two life terms in 2008 after being convicted under U.S. narco-terrorism laws for securing heroin and opium that he knew was bound for the U.S.\n\nUnlike in that arrangement, the U.S. did not give up any prisoner to secure Glezmann’s release, which was done as a goodwill gesture, according to an official briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\nOn Thursday, Afghanistan’s Foreign Ministry confirmed Glezmann’s release on “humanitarian grounds.” In a statement, it said the “Islamic Emirate again reaffirms its longstanding position that dialogue, understanding and diplomacy provide effective avenues for resolving all issues.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden contemplated before he left office an earlier proposal that would have involved the release of Glezmann and other Americans for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nBut Biden told families during a call in January that he would not support trading Rahim unless the Taliban released Mahmood Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and vanished in 2022.\n\nThe FBI and Habibi’s family have said they believe Habibi was taken by Taliban forces, but the Taliban has denied holding him. Representatives for Habibi on Thursday cited what they said was “overwhelming evidence” that he was arrested by the Taliban after his home was searched by people identifying themselves as part of the Taliban’s security service.\n\n“We are confident that the Trump Administration will hold firm that my brother needs to be released for relations with the U.S. to move forward,” one of Habibi’s brothers, Ahmad, said in a statement. “We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him. My brother is an innocent man who has been held away from his wife, young daughter, and elderly parents for 953 days.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Victoria Eastwood in Cairo and Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.",

The remedy uses an adhesive that’s not been found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement,” the NHTSA said, and includes additional reinforcements.\n\nTesla will replace the panel free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 19, 2025.\n\nThe recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025. The NHTSA order says that Tesla became aware of the problem early this year.\n\nVideos posted on social media showing people ripping the panels off of Cybertrucks with their hands have gone viral in recent days.\n\nThe Cybertruck, which Tesla began delivering to buyers in late 2023, has been recalled eight times in the past 15 months for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix acceleration pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim. Other recalls were related to windshield wipers and the display screen.\n\nIt’s the latest setback for the Elon Musk-owned electric automaker, which has come under attack since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that’s slashing government spending.\n\nWhile no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nREAD MORE: As Musk takes prominent role in Trump White House, violent attacks on Tesla dealerships spike\n\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\nEven before the attacks ramped up in recent weeks, Tesla has been struggling, facing increased competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China.\n\nThough largely unaffected by Thursday’s recall announcement, Tesla shares have plummeted 42 percent in 2025, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.\n\nWith regard to Thursday’s recall, Cybertruck owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236, or go to nhtsa.gov.",

        "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — During a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, the U.S. leader apparently suggested Volodymyr Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine’s power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, according to a U.S. statement.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump suggests to Zelenskyy that U.S. take ownership of Ukrainian power plants for security\n\nBriefing the media later, Zelenskyy said the discussion with Trump had focused specifically on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, ZNPP, in southern Ukraine.\n\nWhile the facility remains connected to Ukraine’s energy grid without producing electricity, it has been under Russian control since the early days of the war, making it unclear what future U.S. involvement could look like.\n\nWho controls the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant?\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is one of the world’s 10 largest and Europe’s biggest. Located in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces occupied it shortly after Moscow’s February 2022 invasion.\n\nWhile Russia declared the region annexed in fall 2022, its largest city, Zaporizhzhia, remains under Ukrainian control.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of stationing troops and weapons at the plant and using it as a launchpad for attacks across the Dnipro River. Russia denies this, accusing Ukraine of shelling the facility.\n\nHow many nuclear power plants does Ukraine have?\n\nBesides Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine operates three active nuclear power plants, which generate the majority of the country’s electricity following sustained Russian attacks on thermal and hydroelectric plants.\n\nThese facilities are located in southern, western and northwestern Ukraine, away from frontline areas.\n\nWhat did Trump and Zelenskyy discuss and are there negotiations over Zaporizhzhia’s fate?\n\nDuring their call on Wednesday, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine’s power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\n\n“American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,” Trump suggested, according to the statement.\n\nZelenskyy later told journalists their conversation focused on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and the following day, made it clear that “the issue of ownership” of the other three plants was never discussed.\n\n“All nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine,” he said.\n\nZelenskyy said that when they discussed Zaporizhzhia, the U.S. leader had inquired about the facility’s future. “Trump asked my thoughts on the plant,” Zelenskyy said. “I told him that if it is not Ukrainian, it will not operate. It is illegal.”\n\nEven though ZNPP is a state-owned plant, Zelenskyy acknowledged that if the U.S. were to claim it from Russian control, invest in it and modernize it, Ukraine might consider it. “That is a separate question, an open one,” he said.\n\nWhat is the current state of Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear plant?\n\nSince falling under Russian control, the plant’s conditions have deteriorated. While its six reactors have been shut down for years, they still require power and qualified staff to maintain cooling systems and safety features.\n\nEnergoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, said that after Russian forces took over, Ukrainian personnel were forced to sign contracts with Russian authorities and take Russian citizenship. Those who refused faced abduction or threats, forcing thousands to flee, leaving the facility understaffed and harder to manage.\n\nThe collapse of a dam in June 2023 further jeopardized the plant’s cooling systems, which relied on water from the reservoir. In response, plant administrators dug wells, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nREAD MORE: UN watchdog says the status of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is ‘extremely serious’\n\nZelenskyy said extensive repairs would be needed before the plant could operate again, estimating the process could take at least two years.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly warned the war could cause a radiation leak. While the plant no longer produces electricity, it still holds large amounts of nuclear fuel, requiring constant cooling.\n\nRegular blackouts caused by the fighting have disrupted the facility, though power has been quickly restored each time.\n\nIAEA experts permanently stationed there still face restricted access, with Russian authorities blocking some inspection requests, according to IAEA head Rafael Grossi.\n\nIs any kind of deal imminent?\n\nZelenskyy said the discussions with Trump on restoring Zaporizhzhia were a positive step, but cautioned that no one would work at the plant if Russian forces remained stationed nearby.\n\nControl over the plant is likely to remain a legal and logistical challenge, intertwined with a highly divisive issue for both warring sides: control over the land itself. Russian troops hold the area, while Ukrainian forces are separated from it by the Dnipro River and more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) of terrain.\n\n“Simply handing over the plant while everything within a meter of it remains occupied or armed by Russia — no one will work under such conditions,” Zelenskyy said after the call with Trump. “It’s impossible.”\n\nHe said there would be no way to operate securely in such a scenario. “That would mean that the plant could start operating tomorrow, only to be blown up by the Russians the following day.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president Monday, promising a “revolution of common sense” and taking charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.\n\nWatch all of the Inauguration Day events live in the player above.\n\nTrump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, will act swiftly after the ceremony, with executive orders already prepared for his signature to clamp down on border crossings, increase fossil fuel development and end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government.\n\nWatch our PBS News special coverage below.\n\n\n\nWATCH: President-elect Trump speaks to supporters at rally on eve of his inauguration\n\nDeclaring that government faces a “crisis of trust,” Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration “our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\n\nThe jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages.\n\nThe lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts.\n\nREAD MORE: Pipeline executive compares Dakota protesters to terrorists\n\nGreenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury’s verdict, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser said the organization’s work “is never going to stop.”\n\nThe independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles.\n\nHere are some things to know:\n\nHow was Greenpeace founded?\n\nEnvironmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971.\n\nThe network’s first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to “bear witness,” which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website.\n\nThe U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace’s first major victory.\n\nWhere did the name Greenpeace come from?\n\nDuring initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group’s meetings when someone held up two fingers and said “peace!” according to Greenpeace’s website.\n\nDarnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: “Let’s make it a Green Peace.”\n\nThe name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group’s first fundraiser.\n\nWhat does Greenpeace do today?\n\nGreenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website.\n\nIts work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France’s atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada’s coastal rainforest.\n\nGreenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges.\n\nIt was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years.\n\nWho supports Greenpeace?\n\nGreenpeace is an independent network that does not take money from governments, corporations or political parties, according to its website. Its funding comes from individual contributions, along with foundation grants.\n\nIn 2023, Greenpeace USA had about $40 million in revenue and support, and about $38 million in expenses, according to its online financial statement.\n\nIts website says it does not consider anyone a permanent friend or enemy.\n\n“If your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims,” its website states. “Reverse course, and we will be back.”",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — An FBI agent who publicly accused the agency of a pro-Trump bias has been arrested and charged with disclosing confidential records after authorities say he included sensitive material about investigations and informants into a draft of his memoir.\n\nJohnathan Buma, who claimed in 2023 that the FBI went after President Joe Biden’s son Hunter while stifling his own investigation of President Donald Trump’s ally Rudy Giuliani, was arrested Monday evening at Kennedy Airport in New York as he was about to board a flight out of the country, authorities said.\n\nWATCH: Trump picks loyalist Bongino to be second-in-command at FBI\n\nIn the draft of his book, Buma described himself as “the most significant whistleblower in FBI history.”\n\nFederal prosecutors in California, where Buma had worked as a counterintelligence and counterproliferation agent, charged him on Tuesday with a single count of disclosure of confidential information. The charge is punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nBuma submitted a letter of resignation Sunday, according to an affidavit prepared by an FBI agent involved in the investigation. The probe into Buma’s conduct began well before Trump took office for his second term. The FBI searched Buma’s home in November 2023, when Biden was in office.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with Buma’s lawyer.\n\nAfter filing a whistleblower complaint and testifying before Congress, the court affidavit said Buma went to his FBI office in Orange County, California, in October 2023 and printed copies of about 130 confidential files. The files included summaries of information provided by confidential informants, the identity of an informant and screenshots of text messages he exchanged with an informant, the affidavit said.\n\nSome of that information also appeared in a draft of Buma’s book, the affidavit said.\n\nAfter emailing his bosses that he was taking an unpaid leave of absence, Buma posted excerpts of the draft on social media and emailed copies to various people, some of whom were helping him negotiate a publishing deal, according to the affidavit. Among other things, the book contained information about an FBI investigation into a foreign country’s weapons of mass destruction program, the affidavit said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Education Department, advancing a campaign promise to take apart an agency that’s been a longtime target of conservatives.\n\nWatch Trump’s remarks in the player above.\n\nTrump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Republicans said they will introduce a bill to achieve that.\n\nWATCH: Trump’s vision for dismantling the Department of Education\n\nThe department, however, is not set to close completely. The White House said the department will retain certain critical functions.\n\nTrump said his administration will close the department beyond its “core necessities,” preserving its responsibilities for Title I funding for low-income schools, Pell grants and money for children with disabilities. The White House said earlier it would also continue to manage federal student loans.\n\nThe president blamed the department for America’s lagging academic performance and said states will do a better job.\n\n“It’s doing us no good,” he said at a White House ceremony.\n\nWATCH: McMahon says Trump would involve Congress in plan to close Education Department\n\nAlready, Trump’s Republican administration has been gutting the agency. Its workforce is being slashed in half, and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress.\n\nAdvocates for public schools said eliminating the department would leave children behind in an American education system that is fundamentally unequal.\n\n“This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said.\n\nDemocrats said the order will be fought in the courts and in Congress, and they urged Republicans to join them in opposition.\n\nTrump’s order is “dangerous and illegal” and will disproportionately hurt low-income students, students of color and those with disabilities, said Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe department “was founded in part to guarantee the enforcement of students’ civil rights,” Scott said. “Champions of public school segregation objected, and campaigned for a return to ‘states’ rights.’”\n\nREAD MORE: What does the Education Department do? A guide to the agency Trump wants to gut\n\nSupporters of Trump’s vision for education welcomed the order.\n\n“No more bloated bureaucracy dictating what kids learn or stifling innovation with red tape,” Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, said on social media. “States, communities, and parents can take the reins — tailoring education to what actually works for their kids.”\n\nThe White House has not spelled out formally which department functions could be handed off to other departments or eliminated altogether.\n\nThe department sends billions of dollars a year to schools and oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.\n\nCurrently, much of the agency’s work revolves around managing money — both its extensive student loan portfolio and a range of aid programs for colleges and school districts, like school meals and support for homeless students. The agency also is key in overseeing civil rights enforcement.\n\nStates and districts already control local schools, including curriculum, but some conservatives have pushed to cut strings attached to federal money and provide it to states as “block grants” to be used at their discretion. Block granting has raised questions about vital funding sources including Title I, the largest source of federal money to America’s K-12 schools. Families of children with disabilities have despaired over what could come of the federal department’s work protecting their rights.\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14 percent. The money often supports supplemental programs for vulnerable students, such as the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students or Title I for low-income schools.\n\nREAD MORE: 1,300 Education Department employees will be laid off\n\nColleges and universities are more reliant on money from Washington, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.\n\nRepublicans have talked about closing the Education Department for decades, saying it wastes taxpayer money and inserts the federal government into decisions that should fall to states and schools. The idea has gained popularity recently as conservative parents’ groups demand more authority over their children’s schooling.\n\nIn his platform, Trump promised to close the department “and send it back to the states, where it belongs.” Trump has cast the department as a hotbed of “radicals, zealots and Marxists” who overextend their reach through guidance and regulation.\n\nREAD MORE: What does the education secretary do?\n\nEven as Trump moves to dismantle the department, he has leaned on it to promote elements of his agenda. He has used investigative powers of the Office for Civil Rights and the threat of withdrawing federal education money to target schools and colleges that run afoul of his orders on transgender athletes participating in women’s sports, pro-Palestinian activism and diversity programs.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, dismissed Trump’s claim that he’s returning education to the states. She said he is actually “trying to exert ever more control over local schools and dictate what they can and cannot teach.”\n\nEven some of Trump’s allies have questioned his power to close the agency without action from Congress, and there are doubts about its political popularity. The House considered an amendment to close the agency in 2023, but 60 Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sought to dramatically reduce the agency’s budget and asked Congress to bundle all K-12 funding into block grants that give states more flexibility in how they spend federal money. That move was rejected, with pushback from some Republicans.\n\nLeavitt is one of three administration officials named in a lawsuit by The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

        "content": "The good folks at the Brennan Center for Justice have delivered a helpful primer on the Alien Enemies Act, that dusty, tattered old fig leaf being used by the administration to cover itself for its new mass deportation project. You will be shocked, I’m sure, to learn that the administration is misusing this Revolution-era relic to serve the president’s own mad purposes.\n\nAs the Supreme Court and past presidents have acknowledged, the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority enacted and implemented under the war power. When the Fifth Congress passed the law and the Wilson administration defended it in court during World War I, they did so on the understanding that noncitizens with connections to a foreign belligerent could be “treated as prisoners of war” under the “rules of war under the law of nations.” In the Constitution and other late-1700s statutes, the term invasion is used literally, typically to refer to large-scale attacks. The term predatory incursion is also used literally in writings of that period to refer to slightly smaller attacks like the 1781 Raid on Richmond led by American defector Benedict Arnold.\n\nToday, some anti-immigration politicians and groups urge a non-literal reading of invasion and predatory incursion so that the Alien Enemies Act can be invoked in response to unlawful migration and cross-border narcotics trafficking. These politicians and groups view the Alien Enemies Act as a turbocharged deportation authority. But their proposed reading of the law is at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice, all of which confirm that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority. Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse.\n\nThe problem is that there is enough leaky precedent regarding the use of this law for the administration to use for its own purposes. (For example, President Truman used it to extend wartime detentions and deportations until 1951.) Moreover, as the Brennan report makes clear, there is a yawning loophole through which the courts can dive if they choose to do so.\n\nThe courts should strike down any attempted peacetime use of the Alien Enemies Act, but the political question doctrine may prevent them from doing so. This doctrine cautions the courts against addressing issues that fall within Congress and the president’s constitutional duties and that lack judicially manageable standards for resolution. The courts have used the political question doctrine to avoid resolving claims that touch on matters of war and peace, as well as other sensitive foreign policy matters.\n\nNevertheless, this was a law that was an offense against the Constitution almost from birth. It was part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, President John Adams’s lasting gift to future American autocrats that Thomas Jefferson deemed to be part of the “reign of witches.” In fact, the Alien Enemies Act is the only one of those noxious statutes still on the books, as the Brennan Center said in an earlier report, because it was the only one of those acts without a “sunset” clause. Attempts to repeal it have failed, repeatedly. So like the Espionage Act and other laws enacted to respond to temporary (or imaginary) threats, it sits in our laws like a sleeping virus awaiting another outbreak, like this one.",

They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

His explanations were ... unconventional. From :\n\nHe issued a muffled call for vaccinations in the affected community, but said the choice was a personal one. He suggested that measles vaccine injuries were more common than known, contrary to extensive research. He asserted that natural immunity to measles, gained through infection, somehow also protected against cancer and heart disease, a claim not supported by research. He cheered on questionable treatments like cod liver oil, and said that local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics.\n\nCod-liver oil? Is this guy possessed by the restless spirit of my grandmother? Why not Father John’s Medicine? Or Carter’s Little Liver Pills? Or even one of those old cough remedies that advertised the benefits of heroin. Wait, forget I said that.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Kennedy appeared frustrated that a vaccine-preventable illness rather than chronic disease had drawn national attention during his first weeks as secretary. “We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country—we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” The suggestion that vaccines cause autism has been discredited by dozens of scientific studies.\n\n\n\nAsked whether he opposed so-called measles parties—events that parents hold to purposely spread measles from a sick child to healthy children—Mr. Kennedy said he would “never advise someone to get sick.” But he also praised the benefits of natural immunity, protection gained after becoming infected with a virus, claiming that it lasted longer than vaccine-induced immunity and may later protect against cancers and cardiac disease.\n\nThe secretary suggested that we all consult “frontline doctors,” who, he said, were getting great results from various unconventional nostrums “on the ground.” On the ground in Gaines County, Texas, epicenter of the outbreak, however, the frontline doctors seem to be asking him not to help quite so much.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s focus on unverified treatments has frustrated some doctors in Gaines County, who have been trying to explain to patients that there is no antiviral for measles and that they have little control over which patients suffer serious symptoms. “We already are dealing with people that think measles is not a big deal,” said Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, who has been caring for patients with measles for several weeks. “Now they’re going to think they can get this miracle treatment and that they definitely don’t need to get vaccinated. It’s 100 percent going to make it harder.”\n\nAnd, in the Beyond, Hippocrates gets out of the business.",

Every one of his buildings was a gilded palace of sins against good taste. Years back, there was some talk about his buying the New England Patriots, and I distinctly remember writing a column for the Boston Herald in which I speculated that he was likely to build a waterfall into what was then Sullivan Stadium and probably add a white grand piano to one end zone.

At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "It may be the distraction everybody says it is. It may be a shot across the bow from a corrupt president against investigators who might choose to inconvenience him. It could be both of those. But the release Tuesday of nearly 70,000 pages of heretofore classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy is an early Easter basket full of very interesting accounts of the covert doings of the CIA in the 1960s. And whatever the motives behind their release may be, it is all information that we should have had years ago. The good people at the National Security Archive have sorted through much of the massive information dump and filtered out some very tasty nuggets. For example:\n\nThere is a “family jewels” memo to William Colby dated June 1, 1973, at the height of the revelations regarding the CIA’s history of international dirty tricks. This one begins with a genuinely hilarious spasm of bureaucratic linguistic gymnastics.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone’s files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA’s charter.\n\nA special kind of motivation like, say, telling the country what was being done in its name. Like, say, burglarizing a foreign embassy in Washington.\n\nAs a result of a developing relationship with Philippe de Vosjoli, the SDECE representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by Anatole Golitson, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from the French Consulate.\n\nAlthough certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection against foreign installation in this country.\n\n“Which assumes a new significance today”? Oh, please, do go on.\n\nFinally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone’s dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.\n\nHoly Borgias, Batman. My eyebrows are on the ceiling.\n\nThere’s also a 40-page document detailing CIA meddling in elections all over the globe, as well as with a rising revolutionary movement in Yemen.\n\nAnd there’s an oblique mention that’s going to ring all kinds of bells among Oliver Stone fans.\n\nAlso in the afternoon, the Deputy Director (Plans) read to the Panel a paper on Operation Mongoose which the Director had used earlier in the day for briefing the President. This paper was used on the instruction of the Director. The Panel asked questions about agency activity in Cuba, all of which were answered with the exception of one having to do with the role of the Attorney General. This query was raised by Mr. [Gordon] Gray who recognized and gracefully accepted the fact that he not answered directly.\n\nMr. Gray, who had been the National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration, thus gets a gold star for being incurious.\n\nAgain, there’s very likely nothing in here that will tell us much about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But there’s a great deal to be said for setting the scene, and the American intelligence community was a cynical, occasionally criminal, gang. The more we know about that, the better, and the more evidence we have that JFK had the right idea in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs came a cropper. A thousand pieces, and scattered to the winds.\n\n",

        "content": "This may turn out to mean nothing. We’ve had too many experiences with Chief Justice John Roberts in performance as a tower of Jell-O to count any chickens. But there does seem to be a general brawl shaping up between the executive and judicial branches. The president went out of his way to pick a fight on Wednesday by calling for the impeachment of federal district judge James Boasberg, who ordered a two-week pause in the administration’s human-trafficking operation. The president took to his social-media site to explain his reasoning in the sane and lucid manner to which we’ve become accustomed.\n\nThis Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\nLincolnesque, I tells ya.\n\nFor some reason, this spasm set off the Bat Signal in Roberts’s brain, so he did something he almost never has done. He politely told the president to pound sand. From Politico:\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said Tuesday in a rare and brief statement issued just hours after Trump publicly joined demands by his supporters to remove judges he called “crooked.”\n\nBoy, the chief really threw the handbill at him there.\n\nI’m not sure this even qualifies as “pushback.” That will come, if it ever does, when these multiple abuses of office come before Roberts and his colleagues and when, after that, the president ignores a Supreme Court ruling that goes against him. Until then, I guess, we take what we can get. You will notice that nowhere in this post do I use the word institutionalist. Fool me once, chief...",

Caldwell, commander of the Army Corps’ Sacramento district, wrote that the water that poured out of Lake Kaweah and Success Lake “could not be delivered to Southern California directly.” To do so would have required several steps of coordination with state and federal agencies to transport the water to a rarely used connection point, and it quickly became clear that was impossible in such little time, according to the memo.\n\nThe release was done to satisfy Trump’s executive order, Caldwell wrote. And the colonel had also been asked to send photos of the water to Washington, according to an official familiar with the request who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump posted a photo of water flowing from Lake Kaweah on X the next day.\n\nThere is something so ridiculous and clumsy about this scheme—and it says so much about the childish irresponsibility of the administration—that it’s easy to lose sight of what a destructive episode this likely will turn out to be. Two reservoirs vital to the Central Valley’s growing season have been prematurely drained.\n\n... the episode, a week and a half into Trump’s second term, drew criticism from farmers and officials from both parties in the Central Valley. It also angered many California water officials, who charge that the Trump administration squandered local water supplies in a part of the state where every drop counts, to score quick political points.\n\n“This was completely unprecedented,” said one water official in California who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe concerns about the federal government’s approach. Even though the Los Angeles fires were declared contained soon after the release began, Trump celebrated what he called the “beautiful water flow that I just opened in California ... I only wish they listened to me six years ago,” Trump wrote on X on Jan. 31. “There would have been no fire!”\n\nThat’s pretty much where we all are these days—drowning on the wrong side of the mountains to do any good.",

        "content": "They’ve done everything except hang a sign at every port of entry reading, CLOSED: UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. From The Washington Post:\n\nCanadians are skipping trips to Disney World and music festivals. Europeans are eschewing U.S. national parks, and Chinese travelers are vacationing in Australia instead. International travel to the United States is expected to slide by 5 percent this year, contributing to a $64 billion shortfall for the travel industry, according to Tourism Economics. The research firm had originally forecast a 9 percent increase in foreign travel, but revised its estimate late last month to reflect “polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric.”\n\nThis moment isn’t without precedent. Sacks notes that international tourism slowed sharply during the first Trump presidency, amounting to roughly $20 billion in unrealized revenue, even before covid-related disruptions. Back then, it was tourists from Mexico, China and the Middle East who were pulling back, deterred by the administration’s travel bans, tariffs and tough talk on immigration. This time, Canada—the top source of international travel to the United States—is poised to lead the way. Trump has for weeks said he wants to make the country a “51st state.” In response, Canada’s former prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged Canadians not to vacation in the United States.\n\nPeople don’t want to come here any more. Come April, here in Boston, the administration may have a worse effect on international participation in the Boston Marathon than the pandemic did. In three years, Los Angeles is due to host the Olympics and the Paralympics, and it’s hard to imagine we’ll have regained the trust of the world by then.\n\nAnd then there are all the other reasons people have to come to this country that, in its previous generosity, it shared with the world. No more Japanese people on the Freedom Trail up here. No more Brits visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia to show they don’t hold any grudges. No more Brazilians, or Costa Ricans, or, God help us, Venezuelans staring awestruck into the Grand Canyon. And, what the hell, the government doesn’t care about national parks anymore anyway.\n\nBertha Lopez, who is from Mexico and lives near Toronto, used to cross the U.S. border every few weeks to buy staples like butter and cheese. This year, she’s stopped all of that — and vows not to set foot in the United States for at least a few years. She recently canceled a trip to Arizona to visit a longtime friend whose husband is ill; instead, she’s buying her friend a ticket to visit her in Canada this summer. “All of this talk of making Canada the 51st state has been upsetting. It’s just incredibly offensive,” the 54-year-old said. “So I’m doing what I can: No more Tide. No more Coca-Cola. No more Disney. And barring a funeral or someone in the hospital, I am not going to the United States.”\n\nForgive us, world, for we knew damn well what we were doing.",

For the moment, however, let’s not ask for the moon here. It’s time to press hard on the grunts carrying those orders out. They’re all complicit in illegal acts. They’re all arguably involved in a conspiracy to obstruct justice because of their involvement in defying legitimate orders of the federal courts. Arrest the ICE agents. Arrest the guards. Hell, arrest the pilots who flew the prison planes to El Salvador; arrest whoever slapped the cuffs on Mahmoud Khalil and whoever it was who hustled him off into the night. Arrest enough of them and, maybe, there will be fewer people willing to hide beneath the smoke screens of the administration and its clownish legal teams, by which I definitely include the entire Department of Justice. Let them all argue that they were “just following orders,” but let them do it in court, in public, while wearing ankle irons. Maybe if we lock enough of them up, temporarily, we can instigate a wildcat job action in defense of our battered republic.\n\nDo I believe any of this is legal? I have no idea, but I’m operating on the administration’s own approach to law enforcement, which can be accurately defined as “What the hell, give it a try anyway.” That seems to be working pretty well for them. Let’s feed them their own oysters for a while.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, can we see if White House frontwoman Karoline-with-a-K Leavitt is one of those aliens from V who can unhinge her lower jaw and eat a live rat whole? The woman is the living embodiment of Hamlet’s conclusion that “one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.” On Monday, she was asked about the White House’s using an app meant to help migrants as an encouragement to self-deport, and she referred to how the White House disseminated a video of Salvadoran soldiers and police officers brutalizing the subjects of the administration’s human-trafficking program. This is what she said:\n\n“I would have to check in with the Department of Homeland Security, but it’s a great question,” Leavitt said when asked if any migrants have self-deported, “and we’re very proud to repurpose this app, which the Biden administration abused to facilitate the mass illegal entry of illegal immigrants into our country. It was like a fast pass at Disneyland. That’s not happening under this administration. We are encouraging illegal immigrants to actively self-deport to maybe save themselves from being in one of these fun videos.”\n\n“Fun videos.”\n\nSmile and smile...",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Yes, folks. He’s nutty as the Christmas fruitcake. From The New York Times:\n\nInstead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News. He has repeated the idea in other interviews on the channel.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your latest dispatch from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd he’s not alone.\n\nMr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion. “There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.\n\nImmunologists are aghast.\n\n“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.\n\nShe has a gift for understatement.\n\nSince January 2022, there have been more than 1,600 outbreaks reported on farms and backyard flocks, occurring in every state. More than 166 million birds have been affected. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus, called H5N1, to evolve into a more virulent form. Geneticists have been tracking its mutations closely; so far, the virus has not developed the ability to spread among people. But if H5N1 were to be allowed to run through a flock of five million birds, “that’s literally five million chances for that virus to replicate or to mutate,” Dr. Hansen said.\n\nEvidently, Mr. Secretary thinks that he’s Walter Reed in Cuba, except using chickens and not human volunteers. The super-immune chickens will Tell Us Something.\n\nMr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said. “The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.” Public health regulations would forbid the very few birds that might survive an infection from being sold. In any event, those birds might only be protected against the current version of H5N1, not others that emerge as the virus continues to evolve. “The biology and the immunology doesn’t work that way,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with how we factory-raise our food, especially the animate foodstuffs. But it can only be solved through vigorous government regulation—which, as we know, gives President Musk the vapors, so much so that he's already screwed the pooch on this very thing, forcing the Department of Agriculture to bail out both him and the president he theoretically serves. So, for the moment, there ain't nobody here but us chickens.",

Exodus, 23:1–2\n\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment To This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what's goin' down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin' gets done and where Momma's in the kitchen, and she ain't got no shoes.\n\nIt was a target-rich environment out there this week, and we begin with the winner of this week's FAFO Medal—Minnesota Republican state senator Justin Eichorn. He achieved some fame in wingnut circles by proposing that the state's legislature declare \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" a legitimate form of mental illness. Chuffed by his newfound eminence among the goobers, Eichorn apparently decided to make a phone call. From the AP:\n\nGOP Sen. Justin Eichorn, 40, of Grand Rapids, was arrested in Bloomington on Monday in an undercover operation targeting commercial sex involving juveniles. Investigators had placed multiple ads online offering sex for money, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Court documents indicate Eichorn started sending messages in response to the ads March 11. “I saw your post and (sic) chance you are still available tonight?” one asked, according to an FBI affidavit, while a later message asked, “What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nEichorn exchanged messages with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl over several days, asking about pricing for various sex acts and requesting a picture, the affidavit said. They arranged a meet-up on Monday, where he arrived to find police ready to arrest him. Officers seized two cellphones, a condom, and $129 in cash, it said.\n\nPoor guy. Seems like all he wanted was to FA and all that happened was that he FO in a big way. What's left for the guy? \"FI\" and \"FUM,\" I guess.\n\nWe move along to the Commonwealth (God save it!), where the Boston Globe's Spotlight unit locked onto some serious police misconduct in the area of confidential informants in the city of New Bedford.\n\nWithin the department, Jorge Santos was a rising star. Barely 30, he was part of a specialized squad—the marine unit—tasked with overseeing a stretch of the city’s busy waterfront. Brash and aggressive, he won raves for his work ethic from supervisors, his impressive arrest totals recounted in the local media. In policing’s vernacular, he was a worker, the kind of hard-charging officer who delivered the stats that made bosses look good.\n\nAmong many in the department’s rank-and-file, however, Santos had a far different reputation. He’d long been known as a loose cannon, a reckless officer who cut corners and maybe more. A colleague in the marine unit had warned police higher-ups that Santos was a liability. Officer Mark Raposo told supervisors he would no longer back up Santos on calls because he didn’t want to put himself in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a bizarre scene aboard a fishing boat in which a New Bedford police officer, responding to a disturbance call on the boat, found himself in the middle of a scrum involving the boat's crew and another member of the New Bedford P.D.\n\nNow, Raposo was getting radioed by dispatch and ordered to sort out what exactly was happening aboard the Little Tootie.\n\nScreaming. Fighting. Shouts about drugs and money. And in the middle of the scrum stood his colleague, Santos, mumbling about a “confidential informant...\n\nRaposo stood there, befuddled. What was his colleague—off-duty, armed, alone, and without a warrant or any paperwork—doing here in the middle of the night, tussling with some out-of-town fishermen? This wasn’t some clandestine police operation, Raposo thought. It was a robbery, a “drug rip,” in Raposo’s words. The perpetrator was a fellow cop. And the supposed confidential informant behind it? Probably a fabrication, Raposo figured.\n\nOh, lovely. Overuse of confidential informants has resulted in serious abuse of the concept of confidential informants. (According to Spotlight's examination of what records they could squeeze out of the state's various police departments, nine out of every 10 drug busts in the Commonwealth—God save it!—depended vitally on the use of CI's. The other installments in the Spotlight series describe how the rise of New Bedford's current police chief was fueled by his making busts based on what he said was information from CI's, and an account by a former CI about his terrifying life in Kafkaland in a Massachusetts prison.\n\n“‘Confidential informant’ is really a misnomer, because they’re not providing just confidential information,” said Lance Block, a Florida-based attorney who has helped craft legislation aimed at establishing protections for informants. “I call them ‘civilian operatives’ ... because they’re doing what police officers do.” He questions the whole premise. “We don’t use civilians to direct traffic at a football game, and yet we’re going to use civilians to go undercover and potentially put their life at risk?” he adds. “It just makes no sense.”\n\nWe hop on our pirogue and choogle on down to LOO-si-yana where Governor Greg Landry is letting his bon temps rouler in the state's death chambers. From Bolts:\n\n\n\nSince taking office as governor in January 2024, Landry has signed a flurry of bills functionally abolishing parole going forward, granting police greater immunity, and moving all 17-year-olds into the adult criminal system, even those accused of minor crimes. But the symbolic heart of Landry’s “tough on crime” agenda has been his drive to resume state-sponsored killings. In 2018, Landry had criticized then-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, for not doing enough to jumpstart executions. Once governor, he did not mince words: “Capital punishment is lawful, and we intend to fulfill our legal duty to resume it,” he told legislators at the start of a special legislative session on crime that he called as one of his first official acts as governor.\n\nThe session was a blitzkrieg: Over the nine days it met, the Republican-controlled legislature reauthorized execution by electrocution and legalized nitrogen hypoxia. It also passed a “secrecy statute” that shields execution procedures from scrutiny, rendering them easier to carry out and harder to challenge. In February, Landry announced that the state had formalized a protocol for nitrogen killings. Three executions were quickly scheduled back to back in March. Then, nearly as quickly, one was taken off the calendar after it became clear that the prisoner in question hadn’t exhausted his appeals. Another execution scheduled for this month didn’t happen after the 81-year-old who was slated to be killed died of natural causes.\n\nThe piece centers on one Death Row inmate named Chris Duncan, and alleges that he may have been framed by a couple of doctors who claimed to specialize in \"forensic odontology\"—i.e. bite marks—but whose work had been steadily discredited by other specialists in that field. (A video emerged that seemed to show one of these doctors using a mold of Duncan's teeth to inflict the bite marks on the corpse of the victim, a young girl.) This occurred as bite mark evidence itself was losing its credibility in court.\n\nIt wasn’t just Hayne and West, though: Bite mark analysis itself was being debunked. As of last year, [Journalist Radley] Balko told me, “every single scientific body to evaluate the merit of bite mark analysis has said there’s no scientific merit to it whatsoever.” During a 2012 deposition, even West changed his tune, saying, “I no longer believe in bite mark analysis. I don’t think it should be used in court,” though he would later continue to defend the practice in media interviews. Today, it routinely gets dismissed as junk science. “This bite mark stuff—it’s, I think the legal term is total bullshit,” Stafford Smith said.\n\nDuncan's effort to secure a new trial is still hanging fire. All that's changed is that Landry is now governor and he's dedicated himself to limiting the appeals process that kept Duncan alive long enough to expose the two forensic \"experts\" as quacks. Bad enough that so many politicians are so determined to kill people, but there's no reason to be quite so gleeful about it.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Outdoor Cafe Specialist Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of a state legislature grown exhausted by an excess of democracy. From Tulsa Public Radio:\n\nSenate Bill 1027 would limit the number of initiative petition signatures that could come from high-population areas and would require anyone collecting signatures to be an Oklahoma registered voter. The measure is headed to the state House after the full Senate approved it on Tuesday with a party-line vote of 36-8. The bill would require that no more than 10% of signatures on an initiative petition could come from a county where 400,000 or more people reside. That would affect only residents of Tulsa and Oklahoma counties by capping the total share of signatures from those two counties at 20%.\n\nNaturally, you don't want signatures collected where the most people live because math is hard. That those two counties happen to be the state's most heavily Democratic ones is purely coincidental, I am sure,\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "title": "Amy Coney Barrett Recusing Herself from a Case on Public Funding for Religious Schools Is Mighty Interesting",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Something interesting is happening in the chambers of the Supreme Court. The Nine Wise Souls are preparing to hear the case of Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board v. Drummond and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond. At issue is a decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that denied public funding for a Catholic virtual charter school on the grounds that all the state’s charter schools must by law be public schools and that funding religious charter schools is unconstitutional. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal in the last week of April. At the time, Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to participate in that decision. She did so without explanation.\n\nBarrett, who handed Donald Trump a conservative 6–3 supermajority when she was confirmed to the court, won’t be on the bench to hear it. She recused herself, leaving no explanation for sitting out what could be the most significant legal decision to affect schools in decades. Observers believe the cause is her friendship with Garnett, who was an early legal adviser to the school. Nicole and her husband Richard Garnett, also a Notre Dame law professor, are both faculty fellows with the university’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which represents St Isidore. In a deep irony, the longtime friendship between the two women, forged in Catholic faith and a conservative approach to jurisprudence, now threatens to tip the scales away from a cause Garnett has spent her career defending.\n\nSimply put, with Barrett’s recusal, it is now possible that the Court will split, 4–4, in which case the decision of the Oklahoma supremes would stand and the funding would be denied. This would come as an immense shock to the conservative Catholic legal community centered these days at Notre Dame.\n\nAt Notre Dame, Garnett and Barrett overlapped as faculty members for roughly 17 years. “She became a lifelong friend,” Garnett said. “She lived around the corner from us and we raised our kids together.” And when Trump introduced the mother of seven to the nation, Garnett was seated in the Rose Garden along with senators, White House officials and other dignitaries.\n\nGiven their intersecting interests, it’s very likely that school vouchers—a top conservative priority to provide students with public money to spend at non-public schools—came up in conversation. Until 2017, Barrett served as a trustee at Trinity School at Greenlawn, a private classical Christian academy in South Bend, Indiana, that participates in the state’s voucher program. Garnett, meanwhile, was honing legal arguments in favor of expanding such programs. Before joining the faculty at Notre Dame, she worked as a staff attorney for the Institute for Justice, a right-leaning law firm that has led efforts to open school choice programs to religious schools.\n\nWhen one recalls Justice Clarence Thomas’s arrogant refusal to recuse himself from hearing cases involving the January 6 insurrectionists despite his wife’s involvement in some of the surrounding events, Barrett’s decision to recuse herself here looks like high principle. It will look even more like that if one of the four remaining conservatives on the court jumps ship and creates the 4–4 deadlock. Madam Justice Barrett is becoming interesting.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Just Shredded His Own Credibility",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Chuck Schumer is done like dinner. His announcement on Thursday that he is surrendering to the House’s stopgap vivisection of what vital programs still have survived this administration’s bloodletting shreds what’s left of his credibility as a leader in the Senate and as a national leader in the Democratic party. It doesn’t matter whether he can muster enough votes to stay minority leader—and given what he did on Thursday, he’s likely to be the leader of a Democratic Senate minority for a long time—it no longer matters. As the months go on, and as the president and his ketamine-fueled button man continue their assault on the federal government, now with the complicity of both houses of Congress, Schumer is going to look increasingly silly and irrelevant. Absent an outright mutiny on the Senate floor, that complicity will gain his party ... nothing.\n\nSchumer certainly orchestrated his surrender well—a speech to the Senate, a press conference, and an op-ed in The New York Times. He never can say he wasn’t allowed to make his case. From Politico:\n\nHis points were two-fold: First, a shutdown would play into Trump and Musk’s hands, he argued, allowing them to continue with their slash-and-burn campaign overdrive. His second argument was more political—and in keeping with his long history as a leading strategist counseling his party to pay heed to the concerns of America’s middle class above all else. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift,” Schumer said. “It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\n\n“Right now, Donald Trump owns the chaos in the government. He owns the chaos in the stock market,” he added. “In a shutdown, we would be busy fighting with Republicans over which agencies to reopen, which to keep closed, instead of debating the damage Donald Trump’s agenda is causing the American people.”\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to point out that, for all practical purposes, the administration is shutting down the government anyway, and that by walking away from the fight and giving away what little leverage he has, Schumer has foreclosed any real political opportunity that might have presented itself by making the president “own” the chaos in government. Quite simply, Schumer now “owns” a part of the chaos going forward. The only question is how many Democrats want to partner with him in this new acquisition.\n\nA substantial portion of the Democratic caucus in the House feels hosed. They unanimously lined up against the plan—unafraid of the perils that so spooked Schumer about a shutdown. I think the Democratic members of the House recognized the obvious—that there is no palpable political advantage to be gained in helping the current administration. And if the most recent Quinnipiac poll is to be believed, 53 percent of respondents already blamed the Republicans for any shutdown before Schumer hit the silk. This is because those people looked at what the Republicans already were doing.\n\nMoreover, Schumer’s unilateral surrender completely ignores the fact that the administration is being rendered into sticks and splinters every time it finds itself in front of a federal court. Most recently, we had federal district judge William Alsup’s almost unprecedented ass-kicking in which he angrily ruled that thousands of laid-off federal workers be offered their old jobs back forthwith. From Politico:\n\nAlsup issued his ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions. He lashed out at the Justice Department over its handling of the case, saying he believes that Trump administration lawyers were hiding the facts about who directed the mass firings. “You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross examination would reveal the truth,” the judge said to a DOJ attorney during a hearing Thursday. “I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth. … I’m tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. ... It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” Alsup said.\n\nAnother federal district judge, this one in Maryland, ruled the same way on the same day. From The Washington Post:\n\n[James] Bredar, the judge, had signaled at a recent hearing he was likely to agree, noting to a Justice Department attorney that the case was not about whether the government can terminate people, but if those terminations were conducted legally. At one point, Bredar quoted the Silicon Valley mantra embraced by DOGE head Musk: “Move fast and break things.”\n\n\"Move fast? Fine,” Bredar said. “Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.”\n\nSchumer’s capitulation takes a lot of the political power out of how staunchly the federal courts have stood against the onslaught of the MAGA crew. Sooner or later, the administration is going to act in obvious contempt of court and, possibly, that will go up to the Supreme Court, which would have the opportunity to revisit its horrendous presidential-immunity decision from last July. This is only one of the righteous fights on which Chuck Schumer now has taken a pass. It’s time for someone to buy him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and shuffle him off the stage. He is not a wartime consigliere.\n\nRelated Story EPA Chief Lee Zeldin Is on a Mission to Let the Polluters Pollute\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Another rough couple of days for the administration in the nation’s courts. On Tuesday, an appeals court upheld common sense, always a losing issue for this bunch. This comes after a judge in another court told the DOGE and Pony Show to, well, pony up, because he said so, that’s why.\n\nOne of the most audacious acts of this administration is the president’s delusion that he can simply sign away the 14th Amendment’s plain guarantee of birthright citizenship with a stroke of his mighty pen. (Why do they laugh at his mighty pen?) However, Judge David Barron of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was having none of it. He points out that the administration’s crack legal team didn’t even address this fundamental issue in its brief.\n\nThe Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with 8 U.S.C. § 1401. Nor does the Government contest that, for more than a century, persons in the two categories that the Executive Order seeks to prevent from being recognized as United States citizens have been so recognized. Instead, the Government contends that it can make the requisite showing for a stay of the preliminary injunction even without developing an argument to us that the Executive Order is lawful and even though the enforcement of the Executive Order would dramatically break with the Executive Branch’s longstanding legal position and thereby disrupt longstanding governmental practices.\n\nMeanwhile, another judge, District Judge Christopher Cooper, has told DOGE to open its books so we can all know what the hell is going on. From Politico:\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said the vast and “unprecedented” authority of DOGE, formally known as the U.S. Digital Service, combined with its “unusual secrecy” warrant the urgent release of its internal documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ... “The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Cooper wrote in a 37-page opinion.\n\n“The rapid pace of [DOGE’s] actions, in turn, requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities,” Cooper wrote. “That is especially so given the secrecy with which DOGE has operated.” Cooper leaned heavily on news reports suggesting that Musk’s operation had led to the firing of tens of thousands of government employees, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government-wide deferred resignation program and widespread access to sensitive government databases for relative outsiders.\n\nThis is how, in all legal propriety, you call something a rogue agency and tell it to stand and deliver the reasons why it should continue to operate as one.\n\n“Congress needs the requested information in a timely fashion to use it effectively. The electorate also requires the expeditious production and publication of this information,” Cooper said. “Voters may seek to influence congressional representatives to take action responsive to USDS at any point along the road. And ‘[t]he dissemination of information’ sought by CREW would contribute ‘to an informed electorate capable of developing knowledgeable opinions and sharing those knowledgeable opinions with their elected leaders.’ ”\n\nIt’s becoming quite plain that the president’s hail of executive orders is little more than a rain of shadows. Most of them are so deeply unserious that the only people taking them as anything more than empty gestures are the members of the president’s cult in Congress and some of the more credulous members of the media. Once again, the real crunch will come when he runs out of appeals and tries to ignore the final judgments of the courts. That will be the true reckoning.",

Here’s how we test products and why you should trust us.\n\n(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nBy now, a number of people have shared the video of Rep. Bill Keating’s standing up for Rep. Sarah McBride against her being deliberately misgendered by dumbass Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas). In fact, Keating’s righteous blast at Self was so loud that it almost obscured McBride’s neat little thrust of the shiv when she responded to Self as “Madam Chair.” Sweet.\n\nAnyway, up here, Keating’s response to Self’s nasty introduction of McBride came as something of a surprise. In a congressional delegation containing a number of high-profile members, Bill Keating is something of a backbencher, even though he’s been in Congress since 2011, representing a district that includes Cape Cod and the south coast of Massachusetts. He’s always been a stalwart on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ communities. But the iron in his spine that he demonstrated in Congress the other day comes as no surprise to those of us who remember his noble but failed attempt to overthrow William Bulger as president of the state senate in 1994. This roughly coincided with Bulger’s serial-killer brother Whitey’s decision to go on the lam for 16 years. Still, not many people crossed either Bulger and walked away. Keith Self was no problem at all.\n\nOn Thursday, my friend John Feinstein passed away unexpectedly at the age of 69. During my days as a daily sports columnist—and, before that, as a daily sports reporter specializing in college basketball in the winter and tennis in the summer—John was a fairly consistent presence in my life in the traveling sportswriting circus that follows the major events of the calendar. A Final Four or a US Open in Flushing Meadows without John was unthinkable—though I have to admit that two weeks at the Open with John’s constant (and bad) imitation of Ivan Lendl could be a trial. In 1986, of course, he published , an account of a year spent with Bob Knight’s Indiana Hoosiers that, through the dint of his dogged reporting, was the first look into the fact that IU’s basketball team was being run by a sociopath (although, ultimately, the book pulled that punch). No matter, the book has now sold over 8 million copies, and it broke the best-seller lists for sports books of all kinds. After that, John turned out one book after another, like clockwork, every spring. There were two giants of Father’s Day book sales. One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was John Feinstein.\n\nHe could be impossible. He was as dogmatic as anyone I ever met. He knew what he knew, and he thought he knew what you knew, and he would not be shaken in either belief. He had his favorites, and he was also unshakable in his support of them. (The most heated argument we ever had was over his support of the late Jim Valvano, whom John adored despite his disdain for most coaches who bent the rules as badly as Valvano did.) But dammit, he also had a heart as big as the Ritz, and that made all the difference, and how can you not love a guy who responded to Knight’s calling him both a “whore” and a “pimp” by saying he wished Knight would make up his mind so he’d know how to dress?\n\nThe great Dave McKenna has written a proper obituary over at Defector. We ran in different circles the past few years, and we’d fallen out of touch. Apparently, his last few years had been tinged with more than a little melancholy. I will miss knowing that he’s out there in the world, which is a much quieter place these days, and there are too many empty chairs at the table. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Stomp Off, Let’s Go” (Fat Babies): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1955, is the arrival of Barbara Porritt, the millionth migrant to land in Australia. She shares the video with a Dutch family of 16. Considering how many “migrants” arrived in Australia against their will, the sunniness of this arrival is a nice historical antidote. History is so cool.\n\nIn advance of Himself’s Day on Monday, Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, stopped by the White House this week and got a good close-up look at what we’ve done to ourselves nowadays. He was greeted by a presidential “episode” that must have made him wonder if all those decades of emigration had been worth it after all. From the AP:\n\nAsked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country’s tax policies. “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,” Trump said.\n\nMartin affected the look of a man who suddenly had found himself involved in a carny sideshow as the president went a-wandering in his mind.\n\nAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S. “By the way, I love these socks. What’s with these socks? I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks,” Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room. Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin’s visit. When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let [Rosie] O’Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening. “I like that question,” the president said, adding that Martin was “better off not knowing” about O’Donnell.\n\n(The “reporter” who lobbed this hunk of insane banality into the dialogue was Brian Glenn of the Real America’s Voice, a wing-nut marionette who was the guy who criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit when he met with the president and who also is famously the current main squeeze of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Here’s Tiger Beat on the Potomac taking Glenn’s bullshit seriously.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nThe Donggung palace complex in present-day South Korea was once an elaborate lakeside retreat with at least 26 buildings used for hosting festivals and banquets. Now, archaeologists have also discovered several innovative “flush” toilets at the 1,300-year-old site, including one that likely drained into a nearby waterway. During recent excavations at the complex, researchers found a small two-room building with a hole in the middle of a cut granite slab, according to a statement from the Korean Heritage Service. On either side of the hole, they found wide stepping stones.\n\nExperts think waste from the toilet funneled into an underground holding chamber, similar to those used in outhouses or portable toilets. A servant likely poured water into the hole to flush the waste down a drain and into the chamber. Inside the palace, researchers also found a flush toilet that “directly discharges human waste into the river through a drain,” Kim Gyeong Yeol, an archaeologist with the Korean Heritage Service who led the recent excavations, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus. The interior toilet was probably reserved for use by the crown prince and his court ladies.\n\nI would point out that this is pretty much the same system to which the Supreme Court gave its blessing not that long ago. Plus ça change, plus ça ick.\n\nHey ABC News, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nThe large rock was excavated from the Callide Basin in central Queensland and gifted to the Moura State High School, where it sat unnoticed for two decades, according to the University of Queensland. When paleontologists were asked by the school to examine a cluster of three-toed track marks on the boulder, they found it contains one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, according to a paper published Monday in Historical Biology.\n\nThe rock contains 66 footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs, Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The footprints were likely imprinted onto the boulder as the dinosaurs passed across a patch of wet, white clay, possibly walking along or crossing a waterway during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, Romilio said. “It’s an unprecedented snapshot of dinosaur abundance, movement and behavior from a time when no fossilized dinosaur bones have been found in Australia,” Romilio said.\n\nIn addition to being the name of my next prog-rock band, Dinosaur Abundance appeals to me as a concept. Maybe they were all having a dance back in the day. In any case, they gathered then to make us happy now.\n\n\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "title": "Trump’s Call to Annex Canada as a State Should Have Invoked the 25th Amendment",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What has become plain this week is that the entire administration has committed itself to the president’s pipe dream of annexing Canada as the 51st state. It wasn’t just the president’s bizarre appearance with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, in which the president took a short stroll around the Izonkosphere.\n\n“Canada only works as a state. … This would be the most incredible country visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S., just a straight artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many, many decades ago, and makes no sense.”\n\nIt is necessary at this point to mention that the so-called “artificial line” is usually referred to as a “border.” The president seems to grasp the concept when referring to the “artificial line” separating the United States and Mexico. Strange, that. The president went on.\n\n“It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state. I love [O, Canada]. I think it’s great. Keep it, but it will be for the state, one of our greatest states, maybe our greatest state.”\n\nWonderful. He’s going to let them keep their national anthem, one of the world’s most stirring, but only as a state song, like “On the Banks of the Wabash,” “Georgia on My Mind,” or “On, Wisconsin.” I suppose he’ll let them keep their hockey teams, too.\n\nThe whole episode should have brought about an instantaneous Cabinet meeting at which the 25th Amendment was invoked. The president was clearly irrational. Instead, there was Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick seconding the motion. From the Hill:\n\n“The best way, the president has said it, the best way to actually merge the economies of Canada and the United States is for Canada to become our 51st state. If they want to merge it, that’s how you make it the 51st state,” Lutnick said on Fox Business Network’s Varney & Co.\n\nIt really is a cult, you know.\n\nOn the Bluesky app, journalist and author Garrett Epps shrewdly pointed out that in Fletcher Knebel’s Night of Camp David, one of the first manifestations of President Mark Hollenbach’s mental illness was his secret desire to merge the United States and Canada—as well as all of Scandanavia—into a single entity called “Aspen.” In fact, the book was reissued during the first Trump administration, and it was referenced on TV by both Rachel Maddow and Bob Woodward. Now, though, with the president’s grand design seeming to parallel the grandiose foreign-policy proposal of the fictional President Hollenbach, the book has taken on an even greater salience.\n\n(By the way, the hero of the book is a young, ambitious first-term senator named James McVeagh with whom the crazy president shares his notions in the aforementioned night at Camp David. Maybe you can see J. Divan Vance in that role, but I can’t.)\n\nIn the novel, the crazy president sounds almost rational in explaining the irrational.\n\n“Canada is the wealthiest nation on earth.” Hollenbach’s words raced after each other. …“The mineral riches under her soil are incredible in their immensity. Even with modern demands, they are well-nigh inexhaustible. Believe me, Jim, Canada will be the seat of power in the next century and, properly exploited and conserved, her riches can go for a thousand years. ...\n\n.. But the merger of know-how, power, and character, the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia, the new nation under one parliament and one president could keep the peace for centuries. The president of the union should be the man who dreamed the dreams of giants. ...\n\n… “I only exclude Europe at the start,” said Hollenbach, and his face quickly lighted again. “Right now, Europe has nothing to give us. But once we have built the fortress of Aspen, I predict the nations of Europe will pound at the door to get in. And, if they don’t, we’ll have the power to force them into the new nation. … There are other kinds of pressure, trade duties and barriers, financial measures, economic sanctions, if you will. But, never fear, Jim. England, France, Germany, and the Low Countries, too, can be brought to heel.\n\nWhen Knebel wrote his classic Seven Days in May, about an attempted military junta in Washington, he was drawing on inside knowledge about the turmoil in the Kennedy administration between the president, the Joint Chiefs, and the intelligence community—turmoil that would do a lot to feed suspicions after the president’s murder in 1963. JFK was a big fan of the book, so much that he allowed director John Frankenheimer to photograph the White House so he could make the sets for his film adaptation.\n\nIn the case of Night of Camp David, Knebel was able to draw on American attempts to absorb Canada that dated back to the founding of the nation. In fact, Article XI of the original Articles of Confederation read as follows:\n\nCanada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union.\n\nThe American Revolution helped the new country break off those parts of British North America in and around the Great Lakes. We tried to seize the entire country in the War of 1812, but we failed, and we got Washington burned in the bargain. Through the years up to the American Civil War, there were annexation groups on both sides of the border.\n\nIn 1860, Secretary of State William Seward came close to annexing the territory from Washington state all the way up to Alaska, which at the time was owned by Russia. For a while, it looked like Great Britain might actually swing for the deal. But,when Seward bought Alaska in 1868, the people in the region began to feel uncomfortable with the U.S. closing in from both the north and south, so popular opinion shifted. Then, of course, there were the Fenians.\n\nThe Fenian Brotherhood was a product of one of the periodic risings in Ireland against British rule. It was the American wing of what was called in Ireland the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The American Fenians were a substantial force. They had money—upwards of $500,000—and weapons and an army made up of veterans of the American Civil War. (They were led by John O’Mahony, who’d fought with the 69th New York, part of the famed Irish Brigade.) After the war, the Fenians launched a series of raids into Canada. They came in two bursts—one in 1866 and another in 1870–71. They occurred all over Canada, from Manitoba to the Maritimes. None of them succeeded, and one of them, a raid around the Minnesota–Manitoba border, never even made it into Canada. The only real result was to strengthen Canadian nationalism; the raids were pivotal in the eventual development of the Canadian confederation in 1867, an arrangement that the current U.S. president believes would make a helluva 51st state. In the debate over forming the confederation, Sir John MacDonald said:\n\nIf we do not take advantage of the time, if we show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it may never return, and we shall hereafter bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed to embrace the happy opportunity now offered of founding a great nation under the fostering care of Great Britain, and our Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria.\n\nOne of MacDonald’s primary concerns while forming the confederation was American meddling, especially in the rebellious western parts of Canada. He wrote to his minister of finance:\n\nI cannot understand the desire of the Colonial Office, or of the Company, to saddle the responsibility of the government on Canada just now. It would so completely throw the game into the hands of the insurgents and the Yankee wirepullers, who are to some extent influencing and directing the movement from St. Paul that we cannot foresee the consequences.\n\nYou always have to watch out for those Yankee wirepullers. Can’t trust them worth a damn.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Subscribe here.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "From Politico:\n\nTo fulfill conservative demands to cut non-defense funding, Republican leaders are seeking to zero out funding for a slew of programs—much of which had previous been subject to earmarks personally requested by lawmakers. The bill, for instance, does not renew $40 million in fiscal 2024 funding for more than 70 programs that help children and families. Most had been requested by Democratic senators, but not all: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith previously secured $250,000 for a group that works to prevent child abuse in her home state of Mississippi and GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski requested more than $5 million to help fund homeless shelters and prevent child abuse in Alaska.\n\nAlso forgone are $890 million in grants for health care facilities and equipment. Again, the fiscal 2024 funding had been distributed on a bipartisan basis: GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Roger Wicker of Mississippi were among those who requested funding for clinics and hospitals in their states. Bipartisan emergency preparedness and disaster mitigation projects funded through $293 million of earmarked FEMA dollars are also not renewed, as well as $116 million in Small Business Administration funding and $107 million in workforce development projects. Clean water projects, law enforcement grants and tribal assistance are also targeted in the bill.\n\nThis is the “stopgap” bill that Speaker Moses plans to pass in the House on Tuesday, whereupon he reportedly intends to adjourn the House, dumping this extraordinary lump of toxic cruelty in the Senate’s lap. With a Friday deadline for a government shutdown, this allegedly would put pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. If enough Democrats don’t cross party lines to vote for the bill and the government does shut down, they could get blamed for it. But Speaker Moses needs eight Senate Democrats for this strategy to work—Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul already has come out against the bill. (Senator Aqua Buddha has his reasons, but I think paramount among them is his unquenchable desire to be a pain in the ass.)\n\nI don’t think Schumer can lose eight members of his caucus over this bill, but given the mixed signals from all parts of the Democratic Party these days, I’m not sure anything can be taken for granted. What I do know is that this bill should have been smothered in its cradle by any legislator with a soul. Targeting clean-water projects? Man, fck these people.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Our friends, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists, have taken their act to sea these days, tracking some serious Russian maritime mischief in and around the Mediterranean—specifically, running guns to Libya, and ferrying various types of contraband to various other places, on ships of dubious provenance.\n\nThe documents show how commercial vessels—known as a ghost fleet—employed a range of tricks to avoid detection as they shipped Russian equipment to Libya. They also highlight growing European concerns about Russia’s influence in the country, which officials believed was part of a broader strategy by Moscow to project power in the Mediterranean and several African countries.\n\nAfter Isik posted the photographs, Interpol prepared a report on the Barbaros that found the vessel had manipulated its Automatic Identification System (AIS), the device that transmits information about a ship’s location, in an attempt to conceal its position. The report also found the ship had changed its name three times and had registered itself under the flag of a different country at least 10 times since 2013. The report assessed that the ship “may be carrying firearms destined for Libya” and recommended that authorities closely monitor it.\n\nThree name changes? Ten different flags? There are protected witnesses with less complicated CVs.\n\nRussia’s ghost fleet has enriched Moscow by helping it evade Western sanctions on its oil sales, according to the United States and European Union. Whether carrying oil or arms, these vessels often manipulate their AIS to avoid detection. In dozens of reports produced in 2024, European authorities tracked how vessels turned off their AIS when passing near the Syrian port of Tartus, where Russia maintains a naval base. Sometimes, these ships also spoofed their AIS data to appear in a different place than where they actually were. In another case, according to a report included in the leaked documents, a vessel suspected of shipping arms from Syria to Libya manipulated its location to appear offshore the Lebanese capital of Beirut—but mistakenly transmitted its location as on dry land at the airport, rather than the maritime port.\n\nThe Russians were a lot less clever when they were a bunch of broke Communists.\n\nTheir economy is a den of thieves. Their military is in shambles. They are ruled by a strongman who doesn't even pretend to be anything but a kleptocrat any more, and who seems perpetually to be one step ahead of a panicked flight to Bimini. Yet, despite all that, they still have the wherewithal to run an operation like this, and to sublet an American administration... twice.\n\nAccording to a leaked briefing document, the head of the EU naval mission was advised in June that the number of Russian flights to Libya in the first half of 2024 matched the total for all of 2023, and that the mission had observed “a formalization of the Russian presence” over the past year. The document also described an increase of Russian military shipments to the country. “A Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean is a fact and we see regular navy visits to [Libya],” the briefing document stated. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company that had been operating in Libya since at least 2018, were supplanted in 2024 by the Africa Corps, a unit under the direct control of Russia’s military, the leaked documents reported.\n\nThe Africa Corps. Tobruk. This all seems familiar somehow.\n\nLibya represents “an immediate security issue for Europe” because of Russia’s presence there and the African nation’s role as a migration route, according to the internal summary following the meeting with the German envoy. “It’s a testament to Western strategic negligence,” said El Gomati, the Sadeq Institute director. “Russia has been constructing a military node that is not only capable of destabilizing Libya but also threatens European security 400 miles from NATO’s shores.”\n\n\"Negligence\" is doing a lot of work at having a kind meaning in that sentence.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "content": "Goddamn, even this? From NPR:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms, and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump’s executive order on gender identity.\n\nSeveral federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes. A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, “FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26—Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.”\n\n“Equal Opportunity will not be considered...”\n\nGive my regards to 1954 and remember me to Orval Faubus. And the eye of Sauron descends on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, eventually, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nTo be clear, all businesses—those that have government contracts and those that do not—still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.\n\nFor now.\n\nOn this issue, especially, I do not want to hear anything from the anti-Trump Republicans. Almost from the time Lyndon Johnson handed Dr. King the pen with which h’d signed the CRA in 1964, the Republican Party determined to derive political benefits from attaching itself to the angry remnants of American apartheid. Almost to a person, our new allies made their careers within that context and, as best as I can recall, none of them raised a moral or political objection to the largely successful rollback of the achievements of the civil-rights movement. That is the singular moral failure at the heart of modern American conservatism.\n\n(LBJ saw it coming. And what he said to Bill Moyers is the gentler American equivalent of what Michael Collins said after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921: “I have signed my own death warrant.” They were both right.)\n\nElsewhere in the backward march of history, remember the great story of the Navajo Code Talkers, the Native soldiers who used their tribal language as an unbreakable code during World War II in the Pacific? (Made a pretty good movie, too, with Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach.) Well, apparently, it’s time to forget them again. From the Military Times:\n\nMany links that previously took viewers to informational articles about the Native American service members who used their native language as an indecipherable code to help win World War I and II were no longer accessible as of Tuesday afternoon. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department was working to rectify the situation.\n\nShut up. You got caught.\n\n“The department is restoring content about the Navajo Code Talkers,” the spokesperson said. “It had previously been removed during the auto-removal process.”\n\nSomebody had to program the auto-removal process, which means a decision was made to delete the Navajo material, probably along with the records of minority Medal of Honor winners. And we all have to admit now that LBJ pretty much low-balled that prediction.\n\n",

        "content": "Lee Zeldin, the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t kidding around. He’s spoilin’ for some despoilin’, and he doesn’t care who knows it. From :\n\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.” Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nBecause, as we know, there is no public cost to environmentally inflicted disease or industrial pollution.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nGive Zeldin credit. He may have decided that his job is to help Republican donors poison the whole damn country, but he has by God learned his lines well.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.” Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the average American corporation doesn’t have the social conscience God gave the Gaboon viper. Now that attitude has a friendly administration. Zeldin’s brief is to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from doing anything substantive to protect the environment. Here is what passes for optimism.\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nFirst of all, Zeldin and the administration couldn’t care less about what is said in the “process” of public comment, and they will pull their environmental and economic justifications for the despoilin’ out of the collected works of Professor Otto Yerass. And nobody will be there to stop them. And not for nothing, as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse points out, Zeldin probably lied during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nNot that anyone who matters cares. Rivers will die now, choked to death by Fox News talking points.\n\n",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

But let us take a look at how the charm offensive was going this weekend.\n\nOur own Logan Airport apparently has been turned into an immigration black site, complete with enhanced interrogation. Dozens of stories have emerged of the human costs on the ongoing DOGE and Pony Show—graduate schools rescinding acceptances because federal funding for programs has been cut, Social Security recipients being denied benefits because somebody somewhere declared them dead, pediatric brain-cancer patients being abandoned mid-treatment, court orders now being routinely ignored to the point where tin-pot Central American presidents are mocking them. The president is now threatening to ignore the lawful pardons granted by former president Biden, basing this latest power grab on a theory even more laughable than the one he used to justify his reverse human trafficking to El Salvador. Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army scrubs its website records of Black and Hispanic and other minority military members, including the 442nd Infantry, the famous Nisei unit in World War II that was recruited from Japanese Americans out of the detention camps where they were being held.

        "title": "Shall We See How the President’s Brilliant Trade War Strategies Are Affecting the Folks?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where they sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss bank.\n\nLet’s take a brief look around the country to see how the president’s brilliant trade-war strategies are affecting the Folks. From CNBC:\n\nCaleb Ragland, a soybean farmer in Magnolia, Ky., voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Now, however, he has to navigate a tariff minefield at a time when the sector is already facing major headwinds. … As pressures mount in the industry as a result of tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration—as well as retaliatory levies from other countries—he’s worried about the longevity of his business. “My sons potentially could be the 10th generation if they’re able to farm,” Ragland, who is also the president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC. “And when you have policies that are completely out of our control—that they manipulate our prices 20%, 30%, and on the flip side, our costs go up–we won’t be able to stay in business.” This isn’t the first time farmers have had to deal with new tariffs. Back in Trump’s first term, the trade war with China in 2018—a time when Ragland said the agricultural economy was “in a much better place than it is right now”—cost the U.S. agriculture industry more than $27 billion, and soybeans made up virtually 71% of annualized losses.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Ragland works in an market that got brained by the president’s trade policies in 2018, the last time the president was in office. And yet he voted for him twice since then. I have given up trying to understand this way of thinking. If you can’t rely on simple self-interest as an explanation for voting patterns, then political science might as well be alchemy or necromancy.\n\nIf the trade war has a front line, it probably runs through places like Point Roberts in Washington State. From Global News:\n\nPoint Roberts is a community of about 1,100 people and it is located just south of Tsawwassen. However, it relies on British Columbia for much of its commerce. “Half of us here are dual citizens, including me—Canadian and American, half of us,” Point Roberts resident Brian Calder and former president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce told Global News. “So there’s 500 of us here that have very strong ties to Canada. And I get that they’re upset and angry that their sovereignty is being threatened for no good reason whatsoever. And the animosity and the apprehension, the anger is very, very detrimental to Point Roberts. They stay away.”\n\n“It’s absolutely devastating for Point Roberts businesses, those that are left because we lost half our businesses in the COVID 20 months lockdown, they couldn’t carry themselves through that long period of time,” Calder said. “And of those left, now, they’re just barely hanging on.”\n\nNone of this, of course, is necessary. It is all so much gratuitous negligence. This is the first international conflict playing out completely in the deteriorating mind of an American president. Which doesn’t mean there are no casualties.\n\nCalder said Point Roberts residents consider British Columbians and Canadians brothers and sisters, not just neighbors. “We didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we in this mess? It’s absolutely stupid and it’s not productive and it’s not necessary or needed. And no one wins.” Calder said tensions are high on both sides of the border but some residents have expressed that they are facing hostility when they cross into Canada, which is part of the reason for the bumper sticker. \"We’ve had people actually try and push people over in traffic,” he said. “We’ve had people confronted down at the drug store in Tsawwassen. ‘What are you doing here? Get back to your own (country)’. We don’t have a drug store.”\n\nWe move along to Utah, which was a pioneer in adopting mail-in voting and which remained a reliably conservative state anyway. Now, however, out of what appears to be pure spite, the state legislature seems determined to blow up that proud history. From Bolts:\n\nLannie Chapman, the county clerk who runs this office and serves as the top elections official in Utah’s most populous county, eyed the artifact and considered how different, and difficult, her work would be if the state ever went back to voting the way it did when the old booth was in use. “No, thank you,” she said at the prospect, laughing. “It’s fun for a photo op, but that’s about it.”\n\nThe hypothetical may be a bit too close for comfort. A few miles up the road from Chapman’s Salt Lake City office, at the Utah State Capitol, lawmakers have just put the finishing touches on a major voting-system overhaul: House Bill 300, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature March 6, would end universal vote-by-mail in Utah. It’s a landmark reform that would close an era in which Utah occupied a unique place in the national patchwork of election rules: Since 2019, it’s been the only reliably red state in the country to automatically mail a ballot to every registered voter. HB 300 would instead require any Utah voter to proactively request a mail ballot. It would also impose additional restrictions on how they must return these ballots, for instance by ending the grace period for when they must be delivered to election offices by postal workers. “We are known for safe, secure, and convenient access, and this is going to make everything a lot more difficult,” Chapman said. “It’s not fair to our voters.”\n\nThis is simply conservative fanaticism run amok. Voting officials in Utah from both parties swear by the current vote-by-mail system, and the people seem to like it a great deal. But as Bolts learned, the people carrying the water for these changes are doing so for people far from the Beehive State.\n\nBolts put the question to state Representative Jefferson Burton, the Republican lawmaker who championed the bill. Burton conceded that the audit found no widespread fraud in Utah, and that vote-by-mail has increased turnout. But he cited an “Election Integrity Scorecard” by the Heritage Foundation, the influential national conservative think tank that published Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term. The scorecard ranks Utah 33rd among all states and the District of Columbia, docking Utah significantly for its policies on voter ID and absentee balloting. Burton said he expects that HB 300 will vault Utah into the list’s top 10, and made clear that he tailored his bill to that aim. “They [Heritage] think it should be a conscious decision for a voter to opt in to vote by mail,” he said. The lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action, has endorsed Burton’s bill.\n\nVivisecting a successful election system in Utah in order to gain brownie points with a right-wing intellectual chop shop in Washington is quite cultlike.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Cod-Soaker Friedman of the Algarve brings us a tale of bad chemistry. From News4 in Oklahoma City:\n\nLane Garrett and his family bought their land along the banks of the Cimarron River 16 years ago. “It’s real quiet out here,” Garrett said. “There’s lots of wildlife out here—turkey, quail, deer. There’s a river right over there.” The property sits at the very edge of Logan County, far from the noise and pollution of city life. “Very few people get to look out their kitchen window and see a river,” Garrett said.\n\nSounds idyllic. What could go wrong in paradise?\n\nThat’s why he and his family were frustrated when, in June 2024, they learned a pipeline would be running through their land. Phillips 66 went through the courts to condemn part of the family’s land, securing an easement to build the oil pipeline.\n\nOh, that could go wrong.\n\nConstruction began in January. “They bored underneath the river, and then it came up there on that north bank,” Garrett said. But with the work came a mess. “Just trash, you know, pop cans, chip cans,” Garrett said. “Cigarette butts, things like that.” Then, his brother, William, smelled something near the crew’s boring machine. “I was like, What? What is that? I know that smell, and I know it’s not good. What is that?” William Garrett said. “And then finally looked down and just a pool of hydraulic fluid.” Hydraulic fluid—and a lot of it—was seeping into their pasture. “I would say a good 20 feet to the north, you’d find it on the mud, little drops of where hydraulic fluid had just been sprayed in kind of a west-out direction,” Lane Garrett said.\n\nAfter first denying the whole thing, Phillips 66, the extraction beast that owned the pipeline, assured the Garretts that the hydraulic fluid had been cleaned up. They made a big show of doing so, even though the Garretts thought all the company was doing was “pushing dirt around.” When the cleanup was finally done, Garrett drilled a borehole into the area that allegedly had been cleaned. You can probably guess what they found.\n\n“You can see all that goopiness, all that hydraulic fluid,” William Garrett said. Sure enough, it was all still there—and thanks to recent rains—now heavily soaked into the groundwater all over their pasture, just yards away from the Cimarron River. Land—that the Garretts rely on. “I cut hay, bale hay, and then feed it, you know, to my neighbor’s cattle,” Lane Garrett said. It was supposed to be his family’s quiet paradise, away from the pollution.\n\n“It’s land that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into,” Lane Garrett said. But now, he says it’s land—he just can’t trust. “Now, rather than having chemicals just sitting on top of my pasture, now I’ve got a ball of chemicals, you know, five, six feet down underground in there, and that’s all going to kill everything above it,” Garrett said. “I just—I wanted all that stuff cleaned up. You know, I wish that, you know, the guys on the site, that they would have just been upfront, said, hey, look, there was an accident. This is what happened.”\n\nPipelines leak, and the companies that own them lie. That’s all ye know and all ye need to know.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "America is a great country because every foul-tempered has-been hack can grow up to be president. From Politico:\n\n“I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,” Rahm I. Emanuel, operative-turned-politician-turned-diplomat told me before adding his stock line since returning from serving as ambassador to Japan. “I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me.”\n\nI’m telling you, Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s Jonathan Martin is positively aglow at the thought of this boorish triangulator back in the spotlight. In the immortal words of the late Mr. Zappa—“Oooh, gooey, dripping, steaming!”\n\nSince coming home in January from his stint in Tokyo—a job he repurposed to be American envoy to all of Asia—Emanuel has been as visible as any other Democrat. Never mind that he currently holds no office and hasn’t been on a ballot for a decade. Name the political podcast and Emanuel has likely been on it or will be shortly. He immediately snagged a CNN contract and regular Washington Post column, no small accomplishment for a former official at a moment of retrenchment for news organizations. He’s also hitting the lecture circuit, appearing for paid and gratis gigs before audiences such as the Realtors and the Chicago Economic Club. Emanuel is pointedly avoiding Ivy League campuses and later this month will make his first stop on a service academy tour when he speaks at West Point. Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy.\n\nI cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base. He is now recasting himself as the man with all the grown-up concerns. He’s following the recent trail blazed by Gavin Newsom, except that, unlike Newsom, Emanuel isn’t directly attacking a segment of the trans community. He’s asking the Democrats to blow past the issue entirely, and it’s making Jonathan Martin positively giddy.\n\n“I am done with the discussion of locker rooms, I am done with the discussion of bathrooms and we better start having a conversation about the classroom,” Emanuel said, drawing applause as he alluded to a new study showing more than two-thirds of eighth graders can’t read at grade level. He kept coming back to the study and eventually and explicitly tied the policy to the politics, in Rahm’ian fashion.\n\nOoooh, he has his own adjective now. Do go on.\n\nShortly after his trip to Washington, Emanuel dashed out to Los Angeles to appear on Bill Maher’s show, where he went even further for a less sober audience. “In seventh grade, if I had known I could’ve said the word ‘they’ and gotten in the girls’ bathroom, I would’ve done it,” he said. “We literally are a superpower, we’re facing off against China with 1.4 billion people and two-thirds of our children can’t read eighth grade level.”\n\nThere it all was, in two appearances. Emanuel’s gift for finding a towering issue hidden in plain view; his tactical skills for grasping the political benefits it could confer, delivered with a snappy sound bite to elevate statistics off the page; linking domestic policy to geopolitics and sending a message about another, more controversial topic; and not merely urging Democrats to move on from trans youth issues, but using them as a vehicle to shift the conversation to ground he, and most in his party, would prefer to fight on. Gavin, are you listening?\n\nChristmighty, get a room, will you?\n\nFor the record, Emanuel's history with public education is...how you say?...spotty. As mayor of Chicago, he went to war with the city's teachers and their unions. In 2012, 26,000 members walked out in protest of stalled negotiations on a new contract. The strike went on for seven days despite Emanuel's failed attempt to get a court to order the teachers back to work, and the teachers cleaned his clock. The strike was so successful that it is credited with a revival of unionism in America generally, and with breaking the bipartisan consensus on education \"reform,\" particularly in the area of standardized testing, which has lost a great deal of its allure.\n\nIn fact, Emanuel's tenure as mayor of Chicago unquestionably will be the focus of all the oppo should he actually run for president, and the most fruitful area of research will be Emanuel's relationship to the renegade Chicago Police Department. (How renegade? The Guardian revealed that the CPD was running what essentially was a black site in an old warehouse.) It was his pattern to deflect and stonewall on police accountability until cornered by the weight of public outcry and/or the power of a federal investigation. At which point, Emanuel would make a great show of getting \"out in front\" of the issue. The classic case was the police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald in 2014. From Bloomberg:\n\nBy the time of the 2015 deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Sandra Bland in Texas—both of whom died under questionable circumstances while in police custody—the BLM cause was ascendant. And nowhere did a collision between BLM and the police seem more inevitable at that point than in Chicago, where evidence of decades of police corruption and brutality concerning Black and Latino civilians was surfacing, and it was beyond refutation.\n\n\n\nThis was the political climate that greeted Emanuel as he started his second term as mayor in mid-2015, and he could have gotten in front of the policing issue before a clash happened. Instead, just months into that term, he antagonized both sides. At an October 2015 White House gathering of law enforcement officials, Emanuel said Chicago police officers had gone “fetal”—that they were shrinking back in their public safety duties because of social media-driven backlash to police brutality, or out of fear they’d get caught on live-streaming services doing something shady. In that one statement, he scapegoated police reform activists and infantilized the police force.\n\nThis, I guess, is what Politico would call Emanuel’s tactical skills for grasping political benefits.\n\nI guess that’s what Politico would call Rahm’ian fashion. And then I, for one, will throw up.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Ordinarily, I stay away from the continuing forensic analysis of What the Fck Happened? The election was four months ago. The consequences are drowning us, and it’s hard enough keeping up with the fresh hell unleashed every day to go back and discuss how we all got here. However, in The New York Times on Tuesday, pollster named David Shor, and eventually they came around to a conclusion to which Shor had come from his polling. It is one of the most depressing pieces of dialogue I’ve read in a while.\n\nKLEIN: One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. This is something I was told by top Biden strategists. I don’t see democracy on here or Jan. 6 and the stability of the system. Did you test those, as well?\n\nSHOR: We did. But we did a survey where we just asked people: What’s more important right now—preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives? It was 78 to 18: delivering change that improves people’s lives. One of the hardest things about being a political consultant over the last eight years is that every day Trump does terrible things—things that I think are objectively awful and scary and that [expletive] me off. Things he says, like: I’m going to prosecute my enemies. Then we do a bunch of tests, and voters really don’t want to hear about it from us. I think Trump would do better if he didn’t say those things, for sure. But voters want politicians to talk about concrete ways that they are going to improve people’s lives.\n\nAll my life, it was a given that the more democratic a system was, the better off the people would be. Hell, that was the stated reason for almost all our military and intelligence misadventures of the past 80 years. Both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson proposed economic aid for Vietnam even as they deepened American military involvement in the hopes of stimulating some sort of democratic government in Indochina. (See also: The Quiet American.) It was the stated reason for the grandiose Middle East fantasies of the PNAC crowd during the aughts. When was it that the country stopped believing that? When did we decide, en masse, that democracy and “improving people’s lives” contradicted each other? Personally, I trace it back to Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural address, which supercharged the conservative dogma that “government” was somehow an alien entity and not the creation of a commonwealth in which we all had a stake and to which we had an obligation.\n\nRegulars here at the shebeen know that I am fond of Daniel Webster’s caution against simplifying government.\n\nNothing is more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many qualified rights.\n\nThe stake we all have in a political commonwealth, and to which we have obligations, can be found in those words. In the chat between Klein and Shor can be found the death of that commonwealth. Everything else is a symptom.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nSometimes, and more often these days, the headline says it all. From Reuters:\n\nNASA terminates chief scientist role...\n\nWhy should NASA, of all places, have the luxury of a chief scientist? Is that waste or fraud or abuse?\n\nNASA’s acting administrator Janet Petro told employees by email on Monday the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Office of Science, Policy, and Strategy, and the diversity, equity and inclusion branch within the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity would be closed. The email was seen by Reuters.\n\nMany of NASA’s 18,000 employees have been anxious over the Trump administration efforts to trim back the federal bureaucracy, which have been spearheaded by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, has contracts worth roughly $15 billion with NASA, according to federal contracting data.\n\nActually, were I seeking to eliminate waste in the NASA budget, I might examine the $15 billion parceled out to a company that’s been regularly raining debris all over the Caribbean, but that’s just me.\n\nPetro said in the email that NASA had been actively working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to implement Trump’s January executive order directing government agencies to reduce and reorganize their workforce. NASA’s policy, diversity and science offices are the latest space-focused units in the U.S. to be affected by Trump and Musk’s government efficiency agenda.\n\nIt is important—and very sad—to note that the current chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, is a prominent climatologist who has contributed to several United Nations reports on the climate crisis, and last month Calvin and several other delegates were denied permission to attend a climate conference in China. And this reminds us that the administration is laying off 1,100 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But this administration has wished the climate crisis out into the Phantom Zone, so I’m sure none of this will matter.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "title": "Gucci Westman Just Launched a Powder for People Who Don’t Like Powder",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Gucci Westman is always one to play with color, but not in the ways you’d expect: a flick of brown liner to accentuate the eyes, a fresh pastel across the lids, a pop of pink or red to the lips. No matter how the Westman Atelier founder chooses to awaken the visage, you can expect skin to always look like skin—more radiant, smooth, and hydrated, without ever feeling overdone via featherweight touches and innovative formulas. It’s a philosophy bolstered by her latest launch, the Powder Duos—six blush and contour palettes, available today.\n\n“This concept of playing with a few color combinations ties back to my approach as a makeup artist,” Westman tells Vogue, drawing on two colors instead of one to create dimension and makeup that looks virtually undetectable. “I’ve always loved using complementary colors on the cheek and found the subtle contrast interesting. When you play with a few shades, it feels more real, less monochromatic, as if you’re breathing life into skin. The colors in these duos do just that. The deeper shade adds dimension, the lighter shade adds a pop of color.”\n\nAnd so if you’re wondering how these differ from her already-beloved blush and contour sticks, they actually work together to add dimension to any look by playing with various textures, shades, and formula types. “Powders add impact when they’re layered with cream formulas, and they give longevity whether used alone or in combination,” she says, nodding to her love of powders as much as their cream counterparts. “It has the most luxurious texture and the most premium payoff. The color never streaks, so application feels like a dream.”\n\nThink of the new duos as a master class in powder makeup done right. A finely milled powder, the formula deposits color onto the cheeks with a “whisper-like,” natural-skin finish, as the brand describes it—enriched with plant-derived squalane, volcanic rock, and special-effects pigments. “It’s fine and fluffy, and because of skin-care ingredients like phytosqualane, it gives a beautiful supple finish to the skin,” she says. “Volcanic rock absorbs excess oil and creates a supersoft matte finish without sitting on the skin’s surface.” And though it offers weightless wear, it delivers maximum color payoff. To use, swirl a fluffy brush (Westman Atelier’s Powder Brush is an excellent example of this) into the pigment, and be sure to dust off the excess powder. The formula is buildable, so you can add more blush to your desired pigment—and if the color feels too powerful, keep blending to diffuse.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

[laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]",

        "content": "It’s officially the first day of spring! While seeing those first glimpses of sun and feeling a degree of warmth on the skin is salvation for many, some of us are a little sad to be packing away our winter layers and strong outerwear pieces. I’m thinking of Jennifer Lawrence, who has crafted a chic, cold weather wardrobe that comprises Scandi brands for their heavy duty coats, The Row accessories, and classic flannels. Is J-Law ready for springtime dressing?\n\nHow could any of us have doubted Lawrence’s stealth-chic style gliding comfortably into (slightly) warmer temperatures. The Oscar-winning actor was spotted in New York City alongside husband Cooke Maroney, shedding her usual array of coats in favor of a fuzzy, cobalt blue sweater from The Row, which she layered over a simple t-shirt and paired with indigo blue trousers and adidas sneakers. She also wore her trusty, orange-lensed Port Tanger sunglasses, and seems to have picked up a new vintage bag: A Fendi Selleria, a leather doctor’s style bag with white stitching and a top handle. We know Lawrence loves a statement bag moment, though this one is one of her more muted picks.",

However, when I heard Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis would be reprising their mother-daughter roles in a Freaky Friday reboot inventively titled…Freakier Friday, I knew immediately just how seated I would be for said film.\n\nWhile Freakier Friday isn’t out in theaters until August 8, we’ve officially been blessed with a trailer as of this Friday (shrewd release date on Disney’s part, IMO).

        "content": "Transcript\n\nI can't be a Bon Jovi without good Italian food.\n\n[gentle elegant music]\n\nHi, everyone, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand I am with Vogue today\n\nto serve not only a look, but actually a meal.\n\nI'm wearing a Dolce Archive.\n\nWho? Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella.

        "content": "Although their paths only briefly crossed at an event in college, Benjamin A. Coppel S. set his sights on a happy ending with Andrea Fernández. Twelve years after their first meeting, Benjamin asked her on a date over text, finishing his message with: “And then just maybe, we live happily ever after, sounds good?” Andrea replied, “Sounds like a plan.” While their first date took place in Los Angeles, where they currently reside, Benjamin headed to the Tamayo Museum in Seoul, where Andrea worked at the time, for their second meeting. From then on, their relationship has been filled with spontaneity, art, and far-flung journeys together.\n\nWhen it came time to plan their wedding, Andrea notes the couple wanted their celebration to feel deeply personal—and in a venue imbued with history, character, and meaning. “We envisioned a location that we could drive by years from now and tell our grandchildren, ‘We got married there,’\" the bride says. “When we asked ourselves what space could hold all that sentiment, my father’s childhood home in Chihuahua was the only answer. It’s a house filled with warmth, family traditions, and stories, and we knew it would make the perfect setting for a truly intimate and nostalgic celebration.”\n\nThe vision for the fall wedding day was clear. “We wanted the reception to feel like an elegant yet effortless gathering—as my grandmother would have organized it in the ’50s—that celebrated the home's beauty while adding a refined, contemporary touch,” says Andrea. “Our planners, Jerónimo Gaxiola and his team, perfectly balanced nostalgia with modernity.”\n\nThis balance was also reflected in the look and feel of Andrea’s wedding dress. When daydreaming about what it could look like, Audrey Hepburn immediately came to mind. “I remember stumbling upon a photo of her in the Givenchy gown she wore to The Nun’s Story premiere, and at that moment, my search felt complete,” she shares. Finding this dream dress was turning into an impossible search until she came across bridal stylist Gabrielle Hurwitz. “I sent her an email explaining my struggle, and she kindly responded. I attached the Givenchy reference, and from our first Zoom meeting, she completely understood my vision,” explains Andrea. “Gabrielle presented three designers, but when I saw Emilia Wickstead’s work, I got the chills. It was an instant connection—I didn’t want to see the other options. She immediately arranged a meeting with Juulia from Emilia’s team, and the process began seamlessly.” Andrea would visit London three times for fittings of the sleeveless ivory silk gown with an elegant Watteau train. “My last visit turned into a mini celebration with my friends, toasting to my dream dress,” says the bride. To accessorize the look, she paired the dress with chic Jimmy Choo Mary Janes and Cartier earrings given to her as a gift from Benjamin. For his own wedding look, the groom kept it classic in a Tom Ford tuxedo.",

Slim trainers with gummy soles and classic designs, basically.\n\nBut, on a recent trip to L.A., I noticed a new cult sneaker edging its way into the street-style periphery. A retro one, still, but with a different, cleaner, slightly blockier silhouette. I’m talking about the Autry Medalist Low—an all-American trainer that’s become something of a sleeper hit in recent months.

They faded away in the late ’00s after founder Jim Autry’s death, before engineering a comeback around 2019, when the brand relaunched.

Especially—and Katie already knows this, as do the residents of L.A.—with a classic pair of blue jeans.",

        "title": "15 Calcium-Rich Foods for Stronger Bones and Health Over",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "You know to eat calcium-rich food for optimal bone health (whomst among us haven’t drank a glass of milk every night as a child just to grow a few inches taller?), but this vital nutrient does a lot to keep our bodies functioning properly. “Calcium is the most abundant and essential mineral for our bodies,” says Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of Ambulatory Nutrition Services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “It’s most notable for its role in bone and teeth health, but it also supports muscle and nerve function and is involved in blood clotting.”\n\nWhile calcium can be found in supplements and multivitamins, the best and easiest way to consume calcium is through foods. Dieras says to look at dairy products and vegetables as main sources of the nutrient. You’ll also find calcium in some of your favorite fish dishes and fortified foods. The most common ones that you can incorporate into your diet include the following:\n\nMilk\n\nOne can’t think of calcium without thinking of milk. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of whole milk contains 306 milligrams (mg) of the nutrient.\n\nYogurt\n\nAnother dairy product you can turn to for your calcium fix is yogurt. The USDA says that 100 grams (g) of plain yogurt contains 127 mg of the nutrient.\n\nCheese\n\nA love of cheese also has its health benefits. It is packed with calcium and according to the USDA, half a cup will get you 289 mg of calcium.\n\nCanned Sardines\n\nBut if dairy products are not an option for you, don’t worry; there are plenty of alternatives that are just as rich in calcium. Dieras lists sardines as a great source and in fact, according to the National Institute of Health (NIH), 100g of sardines can get you 382 mg of the nutrient.\n\nSalmon\n\nPacked with vitamins and nutrients (and really delicious if you love fish), salmon is one of the healthiest food options you can consider. According to the USDA, 3 ounces of salmon with bones contain 181 mg of calcium.\n\nKale\n\nVegetables often don’t get talked about enough when it comes to high calcium content, but they’re a great non-dairy option. One cup of kale, for example, has 177 mg of calcium, according to the USDA.\n\nBroccoli\n\nDieras says another easy vegetable to incorporate into your diet for calcium is broccoli. According to the USDA, 100 g of the vegetable contains 46 mg of the nutrient.\n\nBok Choy\n\nThis leafy green typically found in many delicious Asian dishes is packed with calcium. The USDA says one cup will get you 185 mg of nutrient.\n\nSpinach\n\nThere are very few downsides to eating spinach (unless you’re allergic, of course). Packed with so many vitamins and nutrients, it also contains 245 mg of calcium in one cup when cooked.\n\nTofu\n\nYou can reach almost half your needed daily intake of calcium with tofu. According to the USDA, ½ a cup contains 434 mg of the nutrient.\n\nFruit Juices\n\nDieras says that fortified fruit juices are an excellent source of calcium. According to the USDA, one cup of grapefruit juice contains 350 mg and one cup of orange juice contains 349 mg of the nutrient.\n\nCereals\n\nDieras also lists cereals as another source of calcium. The USDA says that 100 g of oats and whole grains can contain 51 mg of the nutrient.\n\nAlmonds\n\nIf you love nuts, almonds have one of the richest sources of calcium. According to the USDA, one cup has 385 mg of the nutrient.\n\nEdamame\n\nNext time you’re out for sushi, consider getting edamame. Another great source of calcium, 100 g contains 63 mg of calcium.\n\nBeans\n\nNo matter which type you go for, most beans are generally good sources of calcium. 100 mg of black beans, for example, contain 191 mg of calcium. 100 g of white beans contain 236 mg of the nutrient and even 100 g of chickpeas contain 111 mg of calcium.\n\nWhat does calcium do for you?\n\nCalcium has loads of benefits. Most commonly known, calcium is needed for building and strengthening our bones. Dieras says that it is also used in muscle movement and hormone release. It also plays a huge role in sending signals to our nerves throughout the body and brain and helps the movement of blood.\n\nHow much calcium do you need?\n\nWith calcium, having too much or too little of the nutrient can be a bad thing. According to the NIH, adults from the ages of 19 to 50 should aim to consume about 1,000 mg of calcium daily. This pretty much stays the same for adult men between the ages of 51 to 70, but adult females in the same age range will need to increase their intake to 1,200 mg.\n\nSigns that you aren’t getting enough calcium include hypocalcemia, tingling or numbness of your fingers, toes, or lips, muscle cramps, spasms, irregular heartbeat, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, fatigue, bone pain, and brittle nails and hair. And while you can easily increase calcium with supplements, Diera says that a balance is required, and too much of the nutrient can lead to increased risk of prostate cancer and heart disease. It is always best to go to a doctor to be properly diagnosed and get proper treatment for a calcium deficit, she says.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "When looking to the recent runways for inspiration, not every spring fashion trend is easy to steal. Alaïa’s barely-there bra tops may be hard to wear to the office, for example. And Jonathan Anderson’s hoop dresses might take up one too many seats on your morning subway commute. But, color is quick to incorporate. Fashion designers often offer an It shade, or two, each season. For spring, they’re serving a generous slab of butter yellow.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Butter Yellow Pieces:\n\nLike other straight-from-the-plate color trends (who can forget avocado green and mocha mousse?), butter yellow is a deliciously chic proposition that was likely not inspired by the world of food. For spring, we saw it on runways at Chanel, Loewe, Tod’s, Miu Miu, and the aforementioned Alaïa. The easy-to-wear color offers a soft twist on your typical neutral, like khaki or cream, adding interest to your look while avoiding the blunt brightness of a primary hue like, say, red or green.\n\nHowever you take it, butter yellow is the perfect shade for spring—smoothly bridging the gap between elegant minimalism and sunny exuberance. It’s a color that brings a pop of energy, while still feeling subtle and luxe. And, it’s a hue that’s seamless to mix with the staples you already own. It pairs especially well with neutrals like ivory, tan, and black. If you want to style it alongside other trending hues, we love it paired with chocolate brown, wispy pink, and icy blue.\n\nFor all of our favorite ways to wear it, check out our styling guide below.\n\nRoom Temperature, Only!\n\nFor cooler mornings but balmier afternoons, it’s all about easy layers you can add (or remove). Balance butter yellow shorts and a matching button-down shirt by adding a light trench coat, khaki socks, and brown boat shoes.\n\nPython-Infused\n\nA butter yellow maxi dress from Tove pairs well with minimalist extras for evening—try a cord necklace, clutch, and Khaite’s python print sandals for a punchy finish.\n\nCacio e Pepe\n\nButter yellow and black is a deliciously satisfying combination. We love Zara’s high-neck jacket paired with a black flared skirt for a soft touch.\n\nI Can’t Believe It’s Not…\n\nAnother all-butter ensemble, this time silk pants and a blouse, pairs unexpectedly well with burgundy ballet flats.\n\nGabriela Coll Garments No.250 crossed fabric bag $550 SSENSE Nothing Written Simon cotton field denim jacket $515 SSENSE\n\nBrowned Butter\n\nTake a cue from the Tod’s runway and pair butter yellow with baby blue. Ivory trousers and a dark brown coat keep the look from feeling too cute.\n\nLemon Meringue\n\nTry Alaïa’s butter yellow balloon trousers with a barely-pink tee. Heavier accessories in black anchor the look.\n\nA Splash of Vanilla\n\nPair Jil Sander’s twisted knit top with a butter yellow maxi and contrasting silver and black accessories.\n\nCream-Filled\n\nNike sneakers, ruffle socks, and a black cardigan toughen up the mood of Proenza Schouler’s butter yellow dress.\n\nShop more butter yellow:",

        "content": "Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco have been out and about promoting their just-dropped new album, I Said I Love You First. While it’s their first collaborative album after a spate of solo tracks together, they’ve both valiantly stayed true to their own individual style on every public appearance. Who said couples have to dress alike? Not this one.\n\nGomez has also been spending considerate time with her stylist Erin Walsh crafting an elevated, elegant look in powder-blue Prada, anticipatory bridal whites, and glittering Armani Prive. Blanco, on the other hand, favors off-beat denim, pastel linen shirts over tank tops, and wacky prints—with a serious collection of cowboy boots.\n\nThe singer-slash-beauty-mogul-slash-actor and the superstar producer, who announced their engagement back in December, appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last night (March 20). And this time, Gomez expanded her more retro aesthetic, opting for a vintage Mugler ‘Vampire’ dress. The strapless black knee-length dress features a pointed bustier and puffed sleeves with a peplum. The sculpted silhouette goes all the way back to 1981 in the Thierry Mugler archives, and features the classic Mugler eyelash detailing on the bust. Gomez paired it with sheer tights and red-bottomed, Louboutin black pumps. She wore her long bob sleek and curled in, and painted her nails a fiery Louboutin red.\n\nBeside her, Blanco looked his usual laidback self, in a lilac shirt, white tank, embellished blue denim, and black boots, accessorizing with layers of gold.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Worried you’re not getting enough protein? For years, I didn’t. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I thought that if I ate too much protein and worked out, I would become bulky—like those muscle men who slam weights around in the gym. It also didn’t help that I grew up in the 2000s, when cereal and granola bars were considered “health food.” Hungry in the middle of the morning? Just have some Special K!\n\nIt’s no wonder I had a bad relationship with food—I ate little more for breakfast than a bowl of fruit. I had cravings all the time, felt exhausted, and experienced mental lapses. And, for the record, my muscles were basically non-existent.\n\nOf course, I’m not alone—many people don’t consume enough protein. In fact, many people do not even include it in the first meal of the day. “For example, in Spain, we eat pan con tomate—bread with tomato—for breakfast and do not add protein,” notes nutrition expert Mariana Sánchez Díaz.\n\nThese days, however, we are getting wise to the fact that getting adequate protein is not just necessary—it is vital for women as we age. It’s also especially important to get it in the morning: Studies show that eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast can prevent fatigue and cravings between meals. “Eggs, Greek yogurt, or rich protein sources such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna help control appetite throughout the day while supporting a faster metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving cognitive function,” explains nutritionist and biologist Anastasiia Kaliga of the holistic wellness app Luvly.\n\nAt the very least, experts say 10% of our daily calories should come from protein. To figure that out in grams, just multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36—the result is the minimum amount of protein in grams you should aim for each day.\n\nSigns you’re not getting enough protein\n\nWhen I finally realized that I wasn’t getting enough protein for my body to function properly, it was because my menstrual cycle became irregular. (Turns out protein is important for hormones, too.)\n\nMissing periods, experts say, is just one sign you may not be getting enough protein. Other symptoms? Swelling in the hands and feet, getting sick frequently, feeling depressed, or having wounds that are slow to heal. Below, nutritionists share a few more signs of not getting enough protein.\n\nFatigue\n\n“In extreme cases, you can be tired and lack energy,” explains nutritionist Mariana Pérez-Trejo Soltwedel. “After all, consuming balanced meals—including protein—is key to keeping the immune system functioning and for regulating your hormones.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "“What is feminine beauty today?” Miuccia Prada asked backstage at Prada, reflecting on a collection that exposed the clichés of femininity and then confidently exploded them. Doubling down on the subject at Miu Miu, she wondered, “do we need femininity in this difficult moment to lift us up?” As a designer, Prada has always taken an accurate temperature of the times, but her idea—that femininity is a sort of accessory that one can put on, take off, and reconfigure, be it with bullet bras, one-size-too-big slip dresses, or retro brooches—was particularly resonant this fall 2025 season.\n\nFemininity was the common denominator in this season’s jewelry, whether it was wholly embraced or tinged with irony. Take the oversized brooches we saw everywhere from Miu Miu to Tom Ford and Tory Burch. Unlike the jewelry of the past few seasons, which exuded a more bohemian spirit, the finishing touches this time around signaled a dressy put-togetherness. Ladylike details in the form of pavé pendants at Luar and teardrop crystals and pears at Givenchy and Erdem continued to consider the classically feminine by both depicting it as is or reimagining it with a sense of play. See also the supersized pearl necklaces at both Vaquera and Chanel, which bookended the Paris collections. Gold got its moment in the sun this season, too, with designers moving away from the silver tones that have dominated the runways since the minimalism of the Phoebe Philo era found new momentum with the arrival of “quiet luxury.”\n\nThe season’s curveball came by way of satiric Duchampian Readymade jewelry fashioned with screwdrivers (Coach), lightbulbs (Moschino), and even shoelaces (Dries Van Noten).\n\nWould You Like to Super Size Your Meal Today?\n\nExtra-large staples with a sense of play.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWelcome to Vanity Fair Oscar Party live. This is the hottest party of the year and the\n\none place where anything can happen. Hello everybody. I'm Tan France and I'm so excited to be back\n\nhere live at Vanity Fair's legendary Oscar bash, here in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe stars are pouring in to celebrate Hollywood's most iconic night as a designer. You know, I'm all about the fashion, and we\n\nalready have had the most amazing looks. There have been so many incredible ones. There's already, uh, Kelly Rowland on the red\n\ncarpet. Looks incredible. We've had Sarah Paulson, who gave us the most\n\nincredible moment. Selma Blair looked magical. Old Hollywood.\n\nUm. Oh, gosh. Who do we have here?\n\nLooking like a vision in gold. But let's kick things off. Let's really get things going with the\n\nwonderful Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine. Hi, Ben.\n\nGood to see you. Hi, Christine. Good to see you.\n\nHi. You lot. How are you?\n\nI'm so. well, I would love to really focus on you and I promise I'm going to come back.\n\nBut your wife, Christine, you look like a knockout.\n\nThank you so much. Do you get a temp check from Ben before you head out of the house?\n\nI do, you do? I feel like he's my biggest fan. Oh, I know.\n\nI mean, this is. Yeah. This was very special, though.\n\nWould you tell her if you were like, honey, I don't know. No, no no, no, I'd say that's the\n\nright answer. That is the right answer. That is the right answer.\n\nNow, can I gush real quick about severance? Oh. Thank you.\n\nNo thank you. I was obsessed with season one. I saw Adam last year, and I'm sure you get\n\nthis reaction a lot at the end of the season. One, I literally stood up from my sofa and held the TV because I couldn't believe that\n\nthat's the way you ended it. Um, the installation you did for the launch of season two was wild.\n\nGrand central station? Yes. Yeah.\n\nUm, can you tell me what the response has been from the audience for season two? It's been so exciting because we were off the\n\nair for three years, as you know. Yeah. And we had a really strong sort of almost\n\nlike a cult audience. I think for the first season, people who were so into it.\n\nBut it wasn't, I don't think, huge numbers. And then the second season, we were offered three years and we came back and somehow a\n\nlot of people discovered us, and we're really happy about that.\n\nI don't know if you know this, Ben, I think. Have you been to England much? Do you know what a tenner is?\n\nWhen I say a tenner, it means 10 pounds. Okay. You might owe me a tenner or 20.\n\nBecause I am the reason that so many people tuned in for season two. I have told everyone I know.\n\nThank you everyone, and I've said it a thousand times over. It's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. I loved it so much. Thank you everybody who works on the show.\n\nWe have such an amazing team of people making the show so incredible, incredible, um, I did this might be a little controversial, but I'm\n\ngoing to go here. You're one for clapping back on social.\n\nMhm. Um. Oh yeah.\n\nUh, which is really surprising. Yeah. Was it just a night I find it fun.\n\nWas it just one night thing, or are you just like, you just want to comment on what you're seeing?\n\nIt depends. It just depends what mood I'm in. By the way, you're moving your hand.\n\nI'm like, you've got an opinion. I want to hear it. No, no.\n\nDo you tell him not to? I always say do not engage. Yeah, but sometimes you feel like engaging\n\nand you give it a shot. I get, but to be honest, it's hard not to engage.\n\nYeah. Okay, on that note, go engage with everyone behind me.\n\nEnjoy your night. You both look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nLovely. Lovely to see you. Amazing.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay.\n\nWhen it comes to pop culture, no one has their finger on the pulse. Quite like Hannah Berner and Paige Desorbo,\n\naka the Giggly Squad, who are here to chat with the stars the only way they can. Hello, ladies.\n\nWhat's going on? Hello, tan. No, the giggly squad is here.\n\nWe are so scared right now. It's a lot of yelling, but the best people watching I've ever seen.\n\nAnd let's not make her wait anymore. Amy Poehler, can you come in away from us, Amy?\n\nGet right in the middle. Tom. Get in here!\n\nOkay. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nThank you. Thank you. So, since when are women in comedy just so\n\nbeautiful? Since 2025. Since 2025.\n\nSomething happened in the planets. No. Women have always been beautiful and funny.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prepare for a night like this? Ooh.\n\nLike a salmon. Salmon like facial or something. Like a mucin situation?\n\nYeah. I wish I don't do. I don't think I do enough.\n\nEvery time I like, I, you know, I ate a croissant today, which is like, I don't do enough.\n\nYou wrapped yourself in velvet, and I love that. Thank you very much.\n\nI gorgeous. I had the trifecta tonight, which never happens where I liked how.\n\nI'm just going to say I like how I look, which never happens. You can say that Timothée Chalamet say I want\n\nto be one of the greatest. You're the greatest of how you look like the Michael Jordan of this party.\n\nYes. Um, and, um, and I liked how it looked. I had fun with my date, and my feet don't\n\nhurt though. That's it. It's only going downhill from here, Amy.\n\nWhen you go in there, what are you at a party like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nI cannot wait to leave. Yeah, yeah, I get that. I cannot wait to get in there so I can do a\n\nlap and then leave. I heard they have the best food, like at this party.\n\nI saw an In-N-Out truck. Fantastic. Yeah.\n\nNow, Amy, you've had some of the most viral moments in the world. Do you feel pressure?\n\nThe whole world, at least. America. Do you feel pressure to, like, outdo your\n\nviral moments, or have you just settled with the greatness that you already have? Thank you so much for saying that.\n\nI do think award shows are kind of funny, and they should be silly and people take them very seriously.\n\nAnd I, you know, it's a big night for a lot of people. I understand they work really hard, but I do\n\nlike it when people goof around. They work hard. But I think when people goof around, it's\n\nfun. So you're saying if you won an Oscar, you wouldn't cry?\n\nI mean, I feel like I feel like I would just disassociate so much. I'm not sure I would cry, but is that the\n\nprice that like you should want? I feel like you have to shed one tear. Even if it's a fake one.\n\nJust shed one. One just a single tear. When you're getting married, if the guy\n\ndoesn't cry. Immediate divorce, divorce I get. I have a lot of feelings about men that cry\n\nat weddings. It's very strange to me. We have time to talk about it.\n\nActually, when they saw we talk about it, they haven't told us to stop yet.\n\nNo. They said. They just said, wrap it up.\n\nThey said, wrap it up. Amy, you're the best. Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nYou look beautiful. We'll send it to Andy over there.\n\nHi, kids. Here's another star lighting up the red carpet.\n\nHe's right there in the screen. Hi, Andy. Look at him.\n\nOh, a corduroy look. He's right there. She's right there.\n\nWhere are you? Holy. Should we talk?\n\nDo you know what? This interview is over. It's these two chatting to each other.\n\nHi, Andy. Good to see you. How are you?\n\nHow are you? Very well. For those who don't know.\n\nLook, I would love to focus on Andy, but I discovered last year that he is married to an icon, Joanna Newsom.\n\nThat's right. I know she couldn't be with us here today. She's hiding away.\n\nShe is. She doesn't do interviews. That's okay.\n\nBut I would like to pretend that you're her tonight. Give me what you got.\n\nHow's life? How's it treating you? Um.\n\nYou've been to this party before. What's it like being married to Andy Samberg? Uh.\n\nOh, boy. I can't answer the last one. Uh, life is beautiful.\n\nOur life is full. Uh, there's music and love flowing out of our home.\n\nI did ask you off camera if she sings around the house and you said yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you request it, or is she just voluntarily volunteers it? I never have to request it.\n\nGood. Also, it wouldn't matter if I did. Okay, good.\n\nIt happens when? When she wants it to happen. Dream.\n\nAbsolute dream. Um, can you talk about SNL 50? Oh, yeah.\n\nTell me about it. Stressful. Exciting.\n\nCan you believe it's 50? It was stressful for me because I worked on it a lot up until it was happening, and then\n\nit was absolute joy and so much fun and being there and watching it live and seeing so many incredible stars from the history of the show\n\ninteracting and doing comedy together and Paul McCartney performing and Lil Wayne and Paul Simon and like, it was kind of like\n\nrelentlessly incredible. It was very overwhelming. It was one of the most exciting moments in TV\n\nI've seen in a really long time. And the fact that you got to be a part of it is just mind blowing.\n\nIt was cool. I met Bonnie Raitt. All right, we're gonna end there.\n\nYeah. We can't beat that. Thank you so much.\n\nI'll see you at the party. Yeah. It's untoppable.\n\nIt is what it is. Thank you. Tan.\n\nWe're joined by the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. Hi.\n\nNo. Our Lord and savior. Literally.\n\nI'll take it. Have you had any moments yet with any celebs? Like in the bathroom or anything fun in the\n\nline? Have you have you crossed paths with anyone or are you like, pretty cool because you've\n\ndone this for a long time. I mean, I feel like I've been coming here for for a good minute of everyone.\n\nNo, you're definitely not sick of everyone. I feel like the last carpet I did was literally a year ago here.\n\nWow. So, wait, when you were to be back when you were preggers, I was popping.\n\nOh my God. Should we have a baby or not? Great question, Hannah.\n\nGreat question. Yes. Okay, fine.\n\nAnd we'll do it. Yes. Well, Keke Palmer just popped one out.\n\nYou just popped one out. And you guys are, like, iconic in every way. Thank you.\n\nAre you. You do what you can. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Vanessa, also, we have to talk about your dress because it's stunning.\n\nI love a feather. I'm a big feather girl. I think they're so good.\n\nWhat's like your process when you're picking your Vanity Fair? Look, because it's different from other red\n\ncarpets. Yeah. I mean, like, I am that girl who genuinely\n\ntries on a dress, and the first one I try on is always the dress.\n\nIt's like a man. It's like a man. You gotta go with your instincts.\n\nIt's like a man. Yeah. It's dating.\n\nIf you don't know in the first 30s. It's not for you, honey. I have a controversial question.\n\nYes. Side part or middle part? I'm normally a middle part girl.\n\nI know. Tonight we're rocking. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm so jealous cause I can't pull off a look at that. You can pull off a side.\n\nYou totally can. Believe in yourself. Okay.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could either. But you just got to go for it.\n\nI'm making this interview about me, and I need to stop. I need to stop.\n\nSo are you. Is there any fashion look that you're kind of or trend that you're kind of over?\n\nI don't know. I mean, nothing really pops to mind.\n\nI mean, I feel like we saw a lot of, like, bigger is better moments. I mean, Cynthia's dress, that Louis Vuitton\n\nwas so iconic. I don't know how she sat. Yeah.\n\nNo, I don't know if she did. It was art. Yeah, it was art.\n\nIt was truly art. The girls are standing on business today. Yeah.\n\nVanessa, thank you so much for stopping by. We'll see you inside. Have fun and welcome back.\n\nYes. And shout out to your baby tan. Back to you.\n\nThank you. Gosh, I love it. Back to me.\n\nPeople are arriving on the carpet. Have you seen them all? They're looking incredible.\n\nWho we got? Serena Williams looking like a vision. VA VA voom has an incredible two.\n\nWho else we got on that red carpet? You know, I can barely see. I'm short sighted.\n\nHere we go. Okay, who have I got? Do you know what?\n\nNever mind. Now let's go to our fellow co-hosts, actor and filmmaker Francesca Scorsese, who's with\n\nSarah Paulson. Okay, so I'm here with Sarah Paulson. Welcome.\n\nThank you. You've worked with Ryan Murphy on so many twisted Tales.\n\nWhat is your favorite horror trope? My favorite horror trope.\n\nOh, God. You know, it's a hard question. The final girl.\n\nI always loved. The final girl. I've been the final girl a couple of times.\n\nThat's true. I'm looking forward to not being the final girl sometimes, but the final girl trope\n\nworks for me. Good. And you've done everything from horror to\n\ndrama. What genre would you like to explore that you haven't yet?\n\nOh, I'd like to do a big stinking comedy because nobody lets me do it.\n\nSince I'm wearing this dress, I feel like comedy will lend itself because, you know, go big or go home is my my motto.\n\nYeah, I love that. That's amazing. And what is the first thing that you plan to\n\ndo when you get into the party? Go straight to the bar. Amazing.\n\nAnd if anyone doesn't say that, they're a loser. Yeah, totally.\n\nI mean, I mean, for all the sober people out there. I don't mean that about you.\n\nI can just, you know, we live in a world now where I'm going to get 22 tweets about how no tweets.\n\nDoes anybody tweet anymore? Okay. I mean, yes, but blue sky, what are we doing\n\nthese days? I don't even really know. I don't even know what it's called.\n\nBlue sky. Blue sky. Sky.\n\nBlue sky. Or blue sky. I mean, I should go inside now, right?\n\nThank you so much. So much. Amazing.\n\nThank you. Kitty, Kitty.\n\nOver your shoulder.\n\nTurn to your right side.\n\nThey say.\n\nThat.\n\nLoving her. Short bang. Yep.\n\nMy face could never pull it off. I'm so jealous.\n\nLook, I mean, am I just meant to stand right next to both of you beautiful women? You guys.\n\nWe're joined by Sofia. Richie. Sofia.\n\nStunning. Thank you guys so much. You're so good.\n\nThank you. I feel like you are the trendiest girl on this carpet right now.\n\nBut you know what? I love you because I feel like you don't even want to be trendy.\n\nYou. You just do things, and then it goes into, like, you're not planning it.\n\nYeah. You know what? I'm really just waking up and living my life.\n\nBut I'm really glad that everyone's on board. No, you are the coolest one here, for sure. She put, like, conditioner on her hair cause\n\nshe was tired and everyone just copied her and was like. And now we put conditioner, coconut oil\n\nbecause my hair was greasy. Yeah. And it worked out.\n\nA lot of power comes. Great responsibility. What's the next trend?\n\nDo you think is going to be happening? Give us what are we going to do?\n\nGuys don't follow trends. That's the next trend. Don't follow a trend.\n\nSo iconic of you to say that was so iconic. Okay, I have a fashion question. Okay.\n\nYou come to a lot of these. You're always like the belle of the ball. You always get on the best dressed list.\n\nWhat's your process like? How do you know when you like a dress and when you don't?\n\nLike, what's your vibe when you're in a fitting? Like, I take a lot of photos in fittings.\n\nThat's a big part of my process. Um, other than that, it's. I have to feel comfortable.\n\nYeah. And I have to feel like a bad bee. Do you ever care what your husband thinks?\n\nOh, 100%. 100%. We've never.\n\nPaige is never asked a man anything. 100%. My husband has good taste.\n\nMy husband has really good taste. I mean, he wears glasses. He's smart so he can see better.\n\nTinted glasses. Always trust a man with tinted glasses. We love you guys.\n\nWe love both of you and your baby. Thank you. Sophia.\n\nCongratulations. Thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me on.\n\nBack to tan. Thank you. Los Angeles is the heart of Hollywood, but\n\nthe recent wildfires have deeply impacted this city. Matt Bomer is here to share how the community\n\nis coming together to rebuild. Thank you. Tan.\n\nI am here with Courtney Bailey, who oversees fundraising for Mptf, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which is a wonderful\n\norganization close to my heart because they're committed to helping everyone in our industry in times of need.\n\nThe recent devastation caused by the LA wildfires demonstrates how critical Mptf is to members of our community who have lost\n\neverything and who are now trying to rebuild their livelihood.\n\nAnd it's not just actors, right, Courtney?

Oh my gosh, do we have a best dressed?\n\nOkay, I don't want to give any early predictions, but who do you like? No, I'm gonna say I loved Kim Kardashian.\n\nI was just about to say it, but I didn't want to be too obvious. She looked incredible.\n\nShe was giving cloud a ethereal. She was honestly giving bed vibes and I loved it.\n\nI also thought that her friend Steph Shep looked amazing. Steph.\n\nGorgeous. Gorgeous. Iconic.\n\nShe's always chic and as you would say, tan. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nAbsolutely stunning. You know who else was stunning? Who?\n\nI'm jealous that you got to speak to Nicole. Oh, well, she's just elegant in every way.\n\nSofia. Sofia. I was gonna say I got her name wrong.\n\nSofia. I was gonna roll with it. I was like, I was like, you are such a ride\n\nor die. You're such a ride. Thank you so much.\n\nI You guys, you guys have got to stop you. Are you looking at the monitor? Look at Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI mean, okay, shades on a red carpet for Jeff.\n\nLook how he's posing. Oh, I love him so much, guy. Okay, you guys, how's your first time going?\n\nThis is your first night hosting this. Are you doing okay? Holding up?\n\nThere's so much adrenaline. We took two beta blockers, and we are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe can't feel a thing right now. Beta blocker.\n\nWe wouldn't feel it. Has there been anyone that you were desperate to talk to that just passed you?\n\nThis is. Well, Serena Williams. Where is she?\n\nOh, don't get me started. She's agile. She got away.\n\nDid she? She's the fastest woman on the planet. So I think I missed her, but I heard people\n\nyelling, so I'm really upset. But I'm a tennis nerd. So that was I was.\n\nI'm obsessed with everything she does. We also we missed Julia Fox, which I'm livid about.\n\nShe did look incredible. I do love that you made a sport reference though, Hannah, as if I might know what\n\nyou're talking about, so I'm gonna have to move on real quick. Francesca's on the red carpet with Leslie and\n\nChelsea. I feel like I'm so excited. You've given me a microphone.\n\nIt's all over. Your job is going to be gone. I know.\n\nHonestly, if I could go. Okay.\n\nI'm so excited to have you guys join me. This is the lovely Chelsea Handler and Leslie Bibb.\n\nThank you. So if the two of you were to team up for a comedy show, what would it be about?\n\nOh, it would have to be some sort of road trip, right?\n\nThink Thelma and Louise. We're on a train. Like a high end train like the Orient Express\n\nor meets Midnight Run. Something like that. Yeah, I think it's Thelma and Louise meets\n\nMidnight Run. And we wouldn't have to do much acting. It would just be improvizational and just\n\nwith, like, loose, loose outlines.\n\nYes, absolutely. This would be exactly what's happening. Her talking and me laughing.\n\nThat's amazing, I love it. And Leslie, The White Lotus is all about secrets and scandals.\n\nSo if this party had a twist ending, what would it be? If this party had a surprise ending.\n\nYeah, we all die.\n\nI mean, that would be very White Lotus. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBody. One body bag. Not one body bag.\n\nOne body bag. No one. You need Mike white.\n\nMike White I'm not a writer, but Mike white would tell you what's best. I love it.\n\nThank you both so, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nOh, VA VA VA voom. Gabrielle Union looks absolutely stunning. Gosh, I love a column dress.\n\nAnd she looks gorgeous in that. Um, who do we have next? Who's this vision?\n\nUm, do you know that dress? Couldn't be hotter. Oh, my God, it's Cyd Sydney Sweeney.\n\nHi, baby girl. Oh, she looks absolutely beautiful when she not looked gorgeous.\n\nI've got to say, Julia Garner might be on my best dressed list for the night.\n\nI'm assuming it's Gucci because she is their brand ambassador and looks Heavenly yaskin.\n\nAnd that girl knows how to pose. Gosh that's good. Love that.\n\nI love that she's giving us texture. Christina Ricci ah, we call her Nina. Hi, Nina.\n\nUm, Christina's looking beautiful.\n\nOh, wow. Oh, and here we have Ben. Gorgeous.\n\nBen. Um, okay. Shall we get back to it?\n\nFrancesca's on the carpet with our darling Dan and Clea.\n\nLet's hit it.\n\nSo I am joined by Dan Levy and Clea Duvall. Thank you so much for being here and for talking, for having us.\n\nUm, Dan, you've mastered the art of fashion both on and off screen. How do you stay true to your personal style?\n\nI don't know, I always feel like when you try something on and you feel your best in it, that's generally what you should be going\n\nwith. But often people can put you in some pretty easy stuff.\n\nYeah. Do you think it's fashion, but if you can't wear it, there's no point.\n\nIt's all the confidence of it. So anyway, sometimes the simpler way to go is always the best.\n\nIt's true, it's true. And is there a genre or role that you've always wanted to explore that you haven't\n\nyet? Um, I mean, I'm fascinated for this answer.\n\nI the genre I'm most excited about is one that I've actually been in as an actor, but as a director, I'd really like to do horror.\n\nLove that. I would love to do horror. I love horror.\n\nI don't think anyone would take me seriously in a horror, really. I would put you in a horror movie.\n\nHorror? Yeah. Okay, great.\n\nOkay, done. Thank you. A horror film.\n\nOkay. All right, so who asked who to this event? Do you guys have, like, a kind of promposal\n\nthing? I said, Cleo, will you come to the Vanity Fair party with me in rose petals?\n\nYeah, in front of Cleo's House. I burst into tears. Into tears.\n\nWow. And I said, of course. The rest is history for us.\n\nReally? God. That's amazing.\n\nThat's so lovely. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nThank you for. Thank you for joining me. And I hope you have the best.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nGosh, Mr. Stanfield, you have never looked more handsome. I love a Saint Laurent suit on a man.\n\nAnd I'm assuming this is his partner who is looking equally stunning. Wow.\n\nCould you imagine being a couple? That's hot. That is that hot?\n\nLike, where do you go from there? You wake up in the morning just knowing this is it.\n\nYou're perfect. Um, you guys, at some point soon, hopefully we're going to see Selena Gomez because she\n\njust rocked up and I see her in line and she's looking she's standing right behind us and we're trying to get out.\n\nI'm so jealous. I know I tried to pretend I was cool too. She looked incredible.\n\nI'm sweating just knowing she's near because I don't want her to know we're talking about her.\n\nNah. Do it. Do it.\n\nShe's wearing so many diamonds. I just burnt out my retina. And you know what?\n\nThe thing is? She's not. They're not on loan, I bet.\n\nLike she's Quincy. She can afford to keep those.\n\nYeah, those are hers. Those are just. Those are her.\n\nHer Saturday night diamonds. Not the regular. Like dishwashing diamonds.\n\nShe'll wear those in the kitchen, I'm sure. She's one of those guys. She also must be tired because she has been\n\non a press run. Do you know what? No.\n\nThat one's got so much energy. She's been doing this for years. She is trained.\n\nShe's a machine. True. I did watch her documentary.\n\nShe's been busy for a long time. Yeah. And she's not stopping anytime soon.\n\nOh, I love when men go for something fun. And they don't just do the traditional.\n\nIt's pirate chic. Pirate chic? Yeah.\n\nI love that you're calling it pirate chic. It is fully Saint Laurent. And you just referred to it as pirate chic.\n\nLOL. Saint Laurent loves a boat.\n\nSaint Laurent has been on a boat before. That's so funny. That's so funny.\n\nAll right. One of the best things about award season is getting to see a more candid, unfiltered side\n\nof Hollywood's biggest stars. Vanity Fair has been capturing such moments for some of our favorite nominees and winners\n\nall season long. They remain. They're still in the city.\n\nThe aspirations of the film really speak to me on many levels. One as an artist, as someone who wants to\n\nleave behind a body of work that is of some significance.\n\nEven distilling work in a film is similar to an architect erecting a building and creating something.\n\nThere's a foundation of work.\n\nSo joining me now is the host of this fabulous party, Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones.\n\nWelcome. Hi, Francesca. Hi.\n\nWhat is so special about tonight? Well, the Oscar party is always special. It is the end of a long season of hard work\n\nand campaigning on the part of the actors and directors and everyone who comes to the party.\n\nIt's it's such an incredible night of celebration, and it's literally the high point of many people's lives.\n\nIt's like the night that they win an Oscar, so that's great. But, you know, we're also conscious this year\n\nthat it's been a difficult start to the year for LA with the wildfires.\n\nWe are happy to be partnering with Baby to Baby and Mptf to provide help out with some wildfire relief for families and for industry\n\nprofessionals. So it feels good to be here to lift those causes up and also to celebrate some amazing\n\ntalent. That's amazing. And what does this party mean to you?\n\nI mean, well, I was thinking on the way over. This is my seventh Oscar party. Lucky seven.\n\nI know. So I think it's going to be a great night. And honestly, it's just so much fun and\n\neveryone comes in and has a wonderful time, so I'm looking forward to the same.\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much and enjoy. Thank you.\n\nAwesome. We are joined by Madison Beer, who I currently have beef with because we both have\n\nthe same good side. We're both going to talk to her like this. That's so crazy.\n\nBecause Hannah wouldn't let me stand on that side for my dress. It's a real fight.\n\nI actually need to stand like this, too. But the crazy thing is, Madison beer does not have a bad side.\n\nAnd you? You do? What are you talking about?\n\nNo. She does. No, I do.\n\nI really do. I do. She said no, you do.\n\nI Vanity Fair Vanity Fair almost fired me because of it.\n\nWait, you're you're singing. Career is blowing up. Your fashion has never been better.\n\nOh my God. What are the vibes right now? I don't know.\n\nAre you excited to be here and talking to us? Absolutely. I'm so honored that I'm here.\n\nThis is amazing. And I feel like you're so nice of you. Sorry.\n\nYou've done. No, she's really nice. She's not looking over here.\n\nSorry. I'm like. You're so nice.\n\nOh my God. I love you guys.\n\nShould we just go in and have a cocktail? I feel like we just want.\n\nOh, wait. So when you're at a party, who are you like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nAre you socializing? Are you just observing? No.\n\nI'm terrified. You're terrified the whole time. But I'm trying to be more confident just in\n\ngeneral. Even if it's, like, fake it till you make it, you know?\n\nYeah. This is how we got here. Trying really hard.\n\nYeah, we lied on our resume when we got here. It's just been fake it till you make it. Yeah.\n\nYeah, I think I'm just trying to be more confident, but internally, I'm like, who am I?\n\nWell, what's your trick when you're not feeling confident, what's your go to thing to do?\n\nPretend. Yeah, you have to pretend. And that's why you deserve an Oscar one day.\n\nIf there's someone that you look up to that you feel like always embodies, like, confidence and stuff, think about them.\n\nThat's what I do. Honestly, I'll think about someone that I'm like, I know this person is always eating.\n\nThey're always confident I love, and I just, like, honestly pretend that I'm them if I'm feeling insecure.\n\nOkay, we have to talk before you go. We have to talk about your dress. Yes.\n\nUB sass. Thank you. It's giving old Hollywood.\n\nI love the black and white. Yeah. No, she's a tall drink of water.\n\nShe's so gorgeous. And I love the high pony. Thank you.\n\nHow do you pick your hairstyle for, like, to match the dress? I never wear my hair up.\n\nEver. Neither do I. Are we twins?\n\nWe look the same. I hate my ears. We do look the same.\n\nWe're twins. Wait. Someone told me I had elf ears when I was\n\ngrowing up. Someone was like. You should get your ears pinned back.\n\nAnd it ruined my life. So here we are. That's so crazy.\n\nI love my ears. No, no, she loves. And you can hear me so well right now.\n\nYou know what I mean? No, absolutely I do. I can hear them across the street.\n\nNo, but nothing gets past you. I honestly just, like, I don't know, I just feel like I try to look at an outfit.\n\nI honestly did this fitting with my hair up, and I was like, I kind of like it, and I hate that I like it.\n\nSo hopefully I don't hate all the photos that come out. No, you crushed it.\n\nYou're absolutely. We look up to you. You killed all the time to think about you.\n\nWhen we want to be confident, when we get inside. Yes.\n\nWe love you. Back to him.\n\nI'm thinking. No thank you. Thank you for doing this.\n\nYou okay? I don't get this. I could.\n\nI'm sorry. You caught me gossiping. I know we were.\n\nWe were gossiping. Emma's my girl, I love you. You know I love you so much.\n\nSo much. This is all the conversation is gonna be. I love you so much.\n\nWe're just gonna gush, but I'm gonna be professional and say this. Okay.\n\nYou look incredible. Thank you so much. Now, I do need you to know.\n\nI knew as soon as she walked off, I was like Jean-Paul Gaultier, right? Yeah.\n\nObviously, it's Jean-Paul Gaultier. Bye, Ludovic. Unbelievable.\n\nI, like, saw this collection, and I was like, if I don't wear that, I'm gonna be sad. I'm gonna be heartbroken with the hat.\n\nLike, it's all so tough, baby. Thank you. It's so tough.\n\nIt's the best you've ever looked. Wait. Stop!\n\nIs it? Thank you. I know she always looks good.\n\nAnd I need you to know I said it off camera, too. And if I don't like someone's.\n\nLook, I don't say it. I love that about you. I'll find a way to come up with something\n\nelse. I love that. It's the best you've ever looked.\n\nI love the short on you. And it's not easy to pull off for most people.\n\nThank you for giving me 80s. I love that. Well, I just like to be honest.\n\nThe reason why I did it and the reason why I chopped it all off was because, honestly. Well, I wanted a change.\n\nI was kind of sick of, like, long hair. I've had it my whole life. But also, it's so much easier to have short\n\nhair. I wake up. Sure is.\n\nAnd my hair is just done. I love that we are almost twinning.\n\nI'm going to go. I'm going to go for your blond soon, I'm sure.\n\nLet's do it I would love I would love so much. Good.\n\nOkay. We were talking about this before you guys joined us.\n\nChamberlain. Coffee? Yes.\n\nYou launched a store? Yes. Wait.\n\nWhat are we calling it? A cafe. Cafe?\n\nA cafe? A cafe that went nuts. It's been truly like an incredible\n\nblessing. Is this the first of many? It's the first of many, hopefully.\n\nBut I always am like. Oh, God. Now, did I jinx it or something?\n\nBut I would love to give me an exclusive. Where's the next one? Opening?\n\nI actually don't know. You know, I would give you the exclusive, but.\n\nAll right, all right. But we're, like, almost house hunting. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's like. Which is so fun. Yeah, we're shopping for the next place, but\n\nit's like you want the aura of the space to be, right? And that takes time.\n\nI'm telling you, this one's going to rule the world one day. She's the baddest around, all right?\n\nRight. If you don't rule the world first, I can't gush anymore.\n\nYou got to go. She's gonna go to the party. I'm gonna see you in the party.\n\nI love you. I love you. I love this girl.\n\nI love you. That's it, that's it. We're out.\n\nI'm going home. I'll see you all later. No.\n\nI'm joking. Well, come join us. Come join us.\n\nLook at this switcheroo. Don't worry about it. Hello, Alan.\n\nHow are you, sir? Good to see you. Very well.\n\nThanks. You're so dapper. You look so dapper.\n\nSo I met you at a party earlier on this year or last year with Corinna.\n\nUm. And you were wearing a gorgeous white suit. And I asked her was that man styled himself\n\nbecause he looks incredible. And you do stuff that most people don't do. Can you tell me about how you get ready for\n\nan event. Do you work with a status or do you just tell yourself?\n\nNo, I work with the stylist Erica Cloud, but do you push that stylist to push you harder because you don't dress like most men?\n\nI do push her to like. I push her to push me. Do you?\n\nYou care about fashion? I do care about fashion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's very much a, like a, like a big part of my life. And I have, like, whenever the cameras\n\nweren't rolling. Yeah. You know, and, um, living in Los Angeles and\n\nnow living in New York, you know, the style is the is the same, but it's different. It sure is.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Yeah, I think the I, you know, I've never\n\nworn sweatpants on a plane, I'll say that. You haven't? Gosh, I live in sweatpants on a plane.\n\nAbsolutely not. I think it's crazy when people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nOkay, wait. I think it's crazy that people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nAbsolutely crazy. I think it's so insane. I just wanna be comfortable.\n\nOkay, enough about fashion. Because I really want to talk about White Lotus.\n\nAnd I know I don't have you for long, right? Um, the the new season of White Lotus has gone nuts, like everyone is talking about it.\n\nDo you do you feel pressure going into White Lotus because it's such a massive show? Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think anybody would be lying if they didn't. If they didn't say that.\n\nYeah. You feel pressured. You don't want to disappoint Mike white first\n\nand foremost. And you don't want to disappoint the fans. Yeah.\n\nAnd you don't want to disappoint the people that you're working with. Right.\n\nYeah. But all of those concerns, like coming to your mind, even, like working with Quentin,\n\nyou know, like Tarantino a couple of times. You always have that kind of going into an experience.\n\nYeah. And then, you know, pretty quickly thereafter, you realize, oh, wait a minute,\n\nI'm a storyteller. That's what I do for a living. I'm going to tell this story as best I can.\n\nNot just the best you can. You're killing it. I'm loving.\n\nI'm such a massive fan. I'm loving the new season. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd you're so damn good on it. Thank you, I think. Terrifying.\n\nA complete A-hole. But I know that you're a lovely man in real life now.\n\nI promise. I promise you that. That by the end of it, we'll fall in love\n\nwith you when it's all said and done. This guy, Rick Hatchet, and the journey that he's on will say something very profound.\n\nAnd it will be visceral in ways that you could not expect. We love a tease that doesn't really give too\n\nmuch away. I'll take that for now. Thank you so much.\n\nWe'll see you in the party. Have fun tonight. Thank you mate.\n\nCheers, buddy. Cheers, buddy. And then we're going to swap.\n\nWe're gonna do a switcheroo again. Look at all these pictures. Thank you so much, mate.\n\nHello, my darling. How are you? Okay, everyone.\n\nCheryl, look at this vision. Um. We did it.\n\nI think I did this with you last year, and I was gagged. I was left gagged, and we had a lovely time.\n\nWell, because you're an angel sent down from heaven. Thank you very much.\n\nYou know, you have the best reputation in Hollywood. Thank you.\n\nUm, can you talk to me about what goes into planning for tonight? Because this is stunning.\n\nThank you. This is Valdrin Sahiti, and my stylist does such an excellent job.\n\nAnd, you know, I think about where we started three years ago to where we have arrived now. Classic simplicity.\n\nTimeless. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful.\n\nShe's so talented. And you look back in 20 years and say, yeah, I looked incredible.\n\nIt's timeless. Um, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. Yes.\n\nNow, when you get up on stage and you say something, it's always profound. As if I've gone to the most incredible\n\nchurch. Do you plan it in advance or. You just are so beautifully philosophical.\n\nAlways. You know something? I'm going to have to take the compliment and\n\nsay that that's just a part of my makeup. It's just a part of who I am as a human being.\n\nI truly, truly believe life is short, and if people don't acknowledge how short it is by spending their days, by being as good as they\n\ncan, as kind as they can, they are wasting their time on this earth.\n\nI could not agree more, and I don't want to take up any more of your time. So go enjoy that party because it's a good\n\none tonight. It's a real good one. The gorgeous Cheryl upstate.\n\nI've got nothing else to say. What's up man? We got Brooklyn, Queens, Albany in the\n\nbuilding. We're actually starting some kind of some kind of band or cult.\n\nJesse, congratulations. You've been on a crazy press tour. Yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. And, like, you've been killing it with Kieran.\n\nOh, thanks. How do you hype yourself up before an interview?\n\nEspecially if you have social anxiety like this one. Yeah.\n\nWe're nervous. If you've heard or seen me in any interviews, I don't hype myself up at all.\n\nI'm very, very low. Low wattage? Yeah.\n\nUnderpromise and overdeliver. That's it. Yeah, exactly.\n\nI'm obsessed with that. Yeah. Have you, like.\n\nDo you like this party? Like, what are you, like, at a party? Like, is this one that you're like, oh, I'm\n\ngoing to dance. Well, I am like, at a party is somebody who's doing a favor for my wife.\n\nYou're a good husband. Oh, it's like. Like your wife took you shopping and you're\n\nsitting and waiting for her. That's like the energy. Pretty much that.\n\nYes, it's pretty much that. And then she often will walk out with a bag. Yes.\n\nYeah, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that a lot. What a date night.\n\nThe Vanity Fair. Yeah. This should net me several things that I\n\ndon't have to go to in the next six months. Has anyone come up to you for a selfie? Who's really famous?\n\nOh, no. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.\n\nNot one person. I couldn't compute your question of like, wait, why?\n\nI don't understand. Oh, have they asked me for a weight? You mean because.\n\nOh, because you're awesome. Jessie. Yeah.\n\nNo no no, no, but I'm not. I think they could tell that I'm not the selfie.\n\nYou're not the kind of guy. Yeah, I think so. I think I give off energy of you'll ruin the\n\nselfie. Something fun. And we had our phones.\n\nWe would take a selfie with you. Then I would. Then you would be my answer.\n\nYeah, yeah, that makes that makes sense. And when you're coming together with a look, do you have opinions with your stylist?\n\nAre you like, this is the vibe I want to put out tonight or does your wife pick your outfits?\n\nUm, sorry. We're hearing a lot of questions.\n\nListen. I'm prepared. No, I they put this on me five minutes before\n\nI left. Yeah. And then, you know, I could take it off and\n\nnever have to wear it until somebody gets married or bar mitzvah in my family for the next several years.\n\nYeah. Do you ever complain about your feet like that?\n\nYour shoes hurt? No. I complain about my feet for other reasons.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, it's kind of more of a bunion issue. Maybe we'll get into that a little later.\n\nThanks. We'll discuss our bunions more in depth. Vanity Fair is telling us we can't discuss\n\nbunions. That's actually the one thing we weren't allowed to talk about tonight.\n\nAre you working on any new projects? How do you find inspiration for a new project?\n\nLook at me. Just asking the deepest question I could think of.\n\nYou know, we're on this purpose on this planet, Jesse. Listen, we all float around for it feels like\n\na second. Um, look, we're just feathers tonight. Makes it feel like gone with the wind.\n\nYes, yes, it's been amazing. Yeah, it's been amazing. And I think people are ready for this\n\ninterview. I think people are going to. I think just with everything that's going on\n\nin the world, I think people are going to be ready for this interview. I know that it's going to change the climate\n\nin some capacity. Yeah. If anything, Hannah's wearing extensions.\n\nI wear extensions really important. Yeah. Do you know what extensions are?\n\nOf course I know what extensions are. Where? Where I can't even get in a fight.\n\nJesse. I was just asking if you knew. I do, and they are seamless.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Would you ever bleach your hair blond.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, definitely. Just like on a movie part, I wouldn't like you wouldn't do it like on a Saturday.\n\nWell, even if you're going through a hard time, you might do it on a Saturday because, you know, usually shooting on Monday.\n\nRight? Okay. So you want to do all the hair dyeing on the\n\nweekend. You're smart with logistics okay. Honestly, he's handled everything we've\n\nthrown at him. And we are so impressed by you. Oh.\n\nThanks, Jesse. You're killing it. Go have fun at the party.\n\nYou've survived. Get away from us! You're so funny.\n\nYou survived. We love you. This was a nice back to you, tan.\n\nThat was great. You guys are great. Oh my God.\n\nJesse, um. Oh, my God, is that Cynthia? Please tell me that.\n\nCynthia. I see the nails. It's got to be Cynthia.\n\nOh, Lina. Love this couple so much. Wow, I love that.\n\nUm, Cynthia's giving us a third look of the night. Well done.\n\nCynthia. Sofia Carson, who said she watched my Netflix specials?\n\nSo obsessed. I love her. We ride at dawn.\n\nLook at this moment. A vision, a vision. You guys.\n\nYou guys look beautiful. How did you decide? Hair up or hair down?\n\nYeah, the hair up was easy because there was a lot. See?\n\nWe're all friends. Sorry. That's Hannah's best friend.\n\nHailey Bieber. We just said hi. Hayley, I'm right here.\n\nThat was crazy. Really cool. No!\n\nStop! It's because she's wearing extensions. I know, she's been acting different.\n\nI Halle Bailey it's the hair. It's the long hair. That's why I asked you.\n\nHair up. There was a lot happening here, so it was an easy decision to take it out.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prep for an event like this? No, I'm pretty boring.\n\nI actually had my first shot of tequila before a carpet. Ever.\n\nJust now. Oh my God. Just now.\n\nHow do you feel? I feel great. Okay, good, good.\n\nNo we're not. It's nice. It's like takes the edge off.\n\nWe're sober. If anyone's wondering, this is us sober. Oh my gosh.\n\nSo when you go to these events, do you have any advice for talking to super famous people?\n\nBecause we've not been doing a great job thus far. What have you guys been doing in your\n\napproach? I just we've just been asking silly questions.\n\nThat's nice though. Yeah. Who are you at a party?\n\nAre you a wallflower? Are you not? I like that.\n\nWe're asking her questions that we asked. We're asking her if our questions were good to other people.\n\nNo. You feel like a girl's girl. And so I feel comfortable.\n\nWe do feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. We do feel comfortable with your energy.\n\nUm, but, yeah, when you go into a party, do you have any advice for, like, looking cool? No, because I'm not cool.\n\nI've never been cool. I was a nerd in school, and I still am, so I just, like, approach them like a fan.\n\nBut I try to be, like, subtle about it. And I still say, like, I just admire you so much and I never know if it's the party to do\n\nit, but everyone seems to take it well. Now I have to ask, did you practice posing in your dress?\n\nYou did practice. What did you come up with? I show you.\n\nYes, yes. Show us please. Okay, so we're fluffing.\n\nWe're fluffing. Keep it down. Yes!\n\nIt's gorgeous. It's like a goddess. This is.\n\nTake note of this. This is important. Right on the hip bone.\n\nRight on the hip bone. It's giving angles. Yes, yes.\n\nOh, my. I'm blind. I'm blind.\n\nThis is crazy. Oh, sorry. Took your mic.\n\nYeah. What's your, like, day to day outfit when you're at home?\n\nThe closest thing to pajamas. Yes. Pajamas.\n\nThe closest thing like to comfy sweats. Oversize everything all the time. Girlhood is about balance.\n\nIt really is. Am I right? When you're right.\n\nWhen you're choosing an outfit. Do you ever choose for comfort? Or do you always go for style?\n\nI've ever chosen for comfort. So to be honest, I will say though, today I was between this dress and another dress that\n\nwas a little out of my comfort zone and this one felt the most me.\n\nYeah. So if that's comfort, then maybe this was the dress, but it's not.\n\nParticularly if you look good, you play good. Exactly. No, it's so true.\n\nIt's about how you feel. Yeah. Yeah, it really is.\n\nSofia, thank you so much for coming. We too nice to us. Such a pleasure.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nGet out of here. Get out of here! Go hang out with someone.\n\nCool. Oh my God! Yes, yes.\n\nUm, okay. I don't even know what to say right now, but my best friend is here.\n\nWe're freaking out. Haley bleeping Bieber is Haley.\n\nHow are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nIt's so nice to meet you. My best friend talks about you all the time. She said my best friend too.\n\nNo, Haley. It's it's. Where's Kendall?\n\nBecause I feel like she's coming. She's coming because that's my best friend you're trying to have, like.\n\nYeah, like a Charlie's Angels moment. You always say crush it on the red carpet. Like, truly, always the queen.\n\nThank you. When you're, like, in the fitting for your dress, for something like this.\n\nDo you know, in the first 30s or are you, like, someone that has to try it on, put it back on, take a picture.\n\nKind of more that because once I try something on, I start conceptualizing the whole thing.\n\nThe hair, the makeup, the whole. You give her a persona? The whole thing head to toe.\n\nBut tonight, I actually was really torn between two dresses. But I went with this one.\n\nIt's custom YSL gorgeous. I love it, I'm super happy.\n\nAnd your skin looks so good. Exactly. That's what I want to know.\n\nWhat road are we wearing right now? Um, well, all my skin prep is always road. And then I also have some of our blush on our\n\npeptide lip shape, a lip treatment. Call it out. Hale's.\n\nCall it out. My mom stole one of my lip treatments. So, mom, we'll discuss this later.\n\nIt's okay. I'll replace it for you. Thank you.\n\nI do, I'm like. Mom, I know someone. I'm good.\n\nSo, Hailey, you go to these parties a lot. Are you ever trying besides me? Are you trying to make any new friends in\n\nthere, or is it kind of. You stick with the group. I'm.\n\nI like to stick with my friends, but I am a social butterfly. I start to kind of just, like, run around and\n\nfly around and talk to people. She literally has an aura around her where you just want to befriend her.\n\nI can feel it. She can literally, literally the best. That's how I feel about you.\n\nAnd now you. Haley. We're the three best friends.\n\nHello. We want to know any posing advice. Because you every carpet you just like.\n\nYou look like you're seven feet tall. I always still get nervous about the way to pose, because, you know, I obviously wanted\n\nto look. Well, they're screaming at you, and it's very overwhelming.\n\nI need a beta blocker. It's very overwhelming. You feel like you're about to get robbed?\n\nYeah. It's crazy. Also, as a mother.\n\nNow on the red carpet. How has it changed your perspective on all these crazy events?\n\nLike having something to ground you? Well, you're just thinking about such different things now.\n\nI'm like, I'm going to go inside and be checking my, my, my baby monitor nonstop. So I have a different mindset.\n\nI have a furbo, so I know I check on my cat. She's a mother. She's a she's a mother.\n\nI'm a mother. To actually Haley as a trendsetter, any trends for that are coming up that you're\n\ninto in terms of fashion because we're just or any trends that you're like, I'm so over it.\n\nYou know, what's so annoying is I just answered that, like, I thought about this the other day and I'm like, people ask me this\n\nquestion a lot. I have to remember my answer and now I forget.\n\nI forget. I'm so annoying. You could literally punch us in the face and\n\nwe don't care. Like you don't have to say anything right now.\n\nYou are incredible. Keeping you. We're obsessed with you.\n\nI'm so happy to see you. Thank you for talking to us.\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for brunch. Get out of here. Get out of here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Lil NAS x, are you kidding me?\n\nOh my God. Guys. We're just.\n\nYay! I like how I'm here. Guys, they have my name with a Z on the\n\nteleprompter instead of an S right now. And we. And that person did just get fired.\n\nYou're fired. No, that person got fired. Get out!\n\nGet them. Literally out also. We've just been staring at ourselves in the\n\nmonitor the whole time, so work it. A vision in white. I'm obsessed.\n\nNo, no, I love it, I love it. I love a cropped blazer, honey. Yes!\n\nOh my God. And the shoe. And the shoes.\n\nCan you, like, lift your leg up? Because I feel like the people at home.\n\nThis is very in right now. I heard, I heard we, Mr. X, I have questions for you.\n\nWhen do you decide to go tiktoking or when do you stop? Because I feel like you.\n\nDo I stop? You know, you go, you disappear for like ten years.\n\nYou come back. Stop it. Right.\n\nHow do you decide? I randomly do it. I like to do it when I like.\n\nHave fun. I don't like to do it, like. Feel like it's an obligation.\n\nYeah. No, I don't like obligated TikTok. Like we.\n\nI wait for this content. I drool for your content, I can't wait. Um, okay.\n\nHow involved are you with putting together looks? Because they're always.\n\nSo you. Yeah. I'm, um.\n\nI'm pretty involved. I never get, like, too crazy. I don't like to step on, like, the stylish\n\ntoes. Yeah. You're not like, yelling.\n\nThey had this. They had this in black. And I was like, okay, can we get it white?\n\nI want to feel godly. Yeah. Can we get, like, on the arm, like my stencil\n\nfor my my next album. Yeah. Like dream boy.\n\nLike I'm getting it on. Yeah. Always be promoting.\n\nPeople don't talk about he lived. He leaves a lot of, um. What does Taylor Swift do?\n\nEaster eggs and stuff. Easter. Easter eggs.\n\nYes. Easter eggs. Shout out to Taylor, shout out Taytay, we\n\nlove you! I need to know, like when you go into a party like this, do you just stunt on everyone\n\nbecause you're a better dancer? Like, are you like, hey, watch this. No, I'm like trying to dance with everybody.\n\nI want to make everybody who looks like they're uncomfortable feel like I'm like. I'm like, yay!\n\nSee if I could dance like you. I'd be like, form a circle around me. I'm going to do something here, you know?\n\nWait, are you guys going to make out? Are you guys going to make out? We're going to do it.\n\nNo, no, not this time. We're streaming so we could. It's not on real time.\n\nNo, no. I'm scared. And also look, his nails look good too.\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yeah. They just came.\n\nThey just came like this. I didn't touch them little things. I used to play your songs all the time to\n\nprep for my stand up. You need to get back to doing it, baby. No, no.\n\nLike when when you're first song came out, you guys aren't going to make out okay. Now he's mad.\n\nNow I'm in a fight. I'm mad. It's okay.\n\nJust scream the next one, okay? I was like, what kind of sexual dungeon are you in right now?\n\nAnd I was like, Lil NAS X. Like, I'm just playing him having fun. No, we are obsessed with you.\n\nYeah. Has anyone, um, like, cool asked you for a selfie?\n\nI'd like to hear tonight. No, because I just got here and I wasn't at the Oscars.\n\nSadly. That's okay. Neither were we.\n\nThis is where the party is. That's cool. Yeah, that was cool.\n\nWhen are you gonna act? When am I going to act? Yeah.\n\nI've had so many opportunities. I keep getting scared. I'm going to do it next time, though.\n\nYeah, do it next time. Getting scared next time. Rooting you on.\n\nYeah. You got it. Euphoria season 18 I'm on you.\n\nImagine if you've been scared in the past. You wouldn't have been where you are today. Okay, I'm not going to.\n\nUm, Mel Robbins, you right now. Let's get back to tan. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you guys so much. Thank you so much. Hi, Lil NAS x.\n\nGosh, that man's handsome. Um. Wow.\n\nGorgeous. Everyone, check out Cynthia. She's always got a look.\n\nShe's one of the best dressed on every red carpet, if not the best.\n\nUm, and this is her third look of the night. She wore two looks at the Oscars, and now she's giving us this drama.\n\nLook at that pose, too. Magical. Magical.\n\nOkay, so we've compared, uh, last year's locks or her past Vanity Fair locks.\n\nIf you see the side of the screen on the right, you'll see what she's worn in the past and she's worn Louis Vuitton in 2024.\n\nIn 2022. Actually, this is the Louis Vuitton look that she wore in 2022.\n\nUm, and the one you just saw was the. Wow. I'm going to repeat that for you.\n\nThis one here is from 2022. And the one with the red backdrop is from 2024 that we saw last year.\n\nAnd she looked gorgeous. Um, and I'm going to throw back to the girls who are with.\n\nLet's see. I can't see I can't see who she's with. Let's see.\n\nShe's with Rachel outside. I will never forget you should. Girls here with Rachel.\n\nWe're literally forgot we were what we were doing as a job. We are here with Rachel Sennott, who's\n\neverywhere right now and is currently going viral for admitting that she's on beta blockers.\n\nAnd, you know, we're on beta blockers. We're strong believers in it. Yeah I didn't.\n\nAre people reacting like it's a big deal? I actually I don't look at the comments. I'm not allowed to.\n\nBut me neither. I think it's a chill, natural thing. Better than heroin.\n\nNatural thing. It truly is. Let me just say it's not something where you\n\nfeel like good, but you just don't feel bad. That's what it is. You don't feel I'm.\n\nI'm literally numb from the neck down. But you know, what I appreciate is we have so much pressure all the time, and people like\n\nto be like, oh, I'm just being me. No, you're like, it gets nerve wracking. And sometimes I pop a pill.\n\nYou can't just raw dog life. That's crazy. No, I'm not being me.\n\nI don't know who this is, but I'm being someone.\n\nI'm obsessed with this dress. You and your stylist, Jared Ellner, are crushing it.\n\nWhat do you tell him before an event to pull off these outfits? Do you have, like, a specific vibe where\n\nyou're like, this is what I want to give tonight? Yeah.\n\nSo, okay. Jared is a genius. Yeah, I would say I want to like Jared, and I\n\nwill mood board. Like, sometimes he'll come over to my house, and then we'll just pull a bunch of photos.\n\nLike, let's just Pinterest a quesadilla. Yeah. But I will say Jared has the vision.\n\nLike he always I'm like, you're amused. He shows me something, and sometimes I'll be like, I don't know.\n\nAnd then I put it on and I'm like, you're a genius. Also, Rachel is hysterical, but also, like,\n\niconically beautiful. You're known for your pout. Can you teach us how to do your iconic pout?\n\nLet's do it in the camera. Like, how do we pull it off? I would say so what?\n\nWhat side of your face do you like better? This. We've been over this.\n\nNo, we've been fighting about it. Okay, so do your favorite side of the face. Okay.\n\nChin down. A little kind of dead eyes. Dead.\n\nAnd then. Sorry, I can't talk because I'm doing it, so.\n\nOh, I feel like I feel like we got the energy of it, though.\n\nBlow out of the lips. I think we got it. I'm obsessed.\n\nAlso, as a comic, you're chatty. You're a yapper. So am I.\n\nTotally. Are you yapping to people in there, or are you playing it cool to everyone?\n\nAre you kidding me? I can't not yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're not yapping, you're not\n\nyapping. Are you alive? You're not living, you know.\n\nRachel Sennott, get out there. We love you. We can't wait to watch your new show coming\n\nout. I'm so excited. Thank you.\n\nThank you, guys for coming. Back to you. Thank you for shopping with us.\n\nAnd we have all been heartbroken by the devastating fires that have ravaged Los Angeles.\n\nFrancesca is with one local organization aiding in the recovery.\n\nI'm here with Nora and Kelly from the incredible organization Baby to Baby. We all know that the Oscars celebrate the\n\nbest performances. What is the best act of kindness that you've witnessed recently?\n\nWell, baby to baby. We've had so many people coming to volunteer to help the cause, coming to donate supplies,\n\nbut also providing, you know, funds and emergency essentials to baby to baby and the families and children we serve.\n\nPeople have been coming in to volunteer just in droves from across the country and here in LA, but also people who even lost their own\n\nhomes have been showing up for us to support the families affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fire.\n\nSo it's been really incredible to see. That's amazing. That's beautiful.\n\nVanity Fair is thrilled to be partnering with Baby to Baby this year, and you've all done so much for children and families here in LA.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your work so far?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so grateful to Vanity Fair for the resources for coming in and rolling up their\n\nsleeves. And helping baby to Baby provides emergency essentials to children and babies in\n\nparticular. And so already in the last eight weeks, we've distributed 12 million items, including\n\ndiapers, wipes, hygiene products, blankets, strollers, cribs, clothing and those are going to children and families and babies\n\nimpacted by both the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nWow. That's amazing. And now that the LA community is turning\n\ntoward rebuilding, What plans does baby to baby have for the future?\n\nWell, we know from our disaster response because we've been doing it for over ten years that families really need help for\n\nmonths and years to come. It's not just these eight weeks, I mean, and immediately, obviously, we were able to\n\ndistribute these emergency supplies to children and families.\n\nBut this will continue and our work will continue for a long time to come. It's a long road ahead for families,\n\nespecially who've lost their homes, their jobs, their livelihoods. So baby to baby will be here.\n\nAnd we can't thank Vanity Fair enough for the incredible support they've given.\n\nThank you Francesca. We are with the one and only Jeremy Pope. This is what my husband wants to do to me\n\nwhen I get too chatty. That's. You look incredible.\n\nWhat is the story of that? What is the story tonight? I'm feeling inspired.\n\nI'm feeling creative. I'm in my Dune era. We're celebrating Dune.\n\nNo, it's. It was a fun look that I love. It's Egan lab.\n\nI pulled it to myself, you are wearing like, are these heels or platforms like a Rick Owens?\n\nCan I, can I lift a little? Okay. Yeah.\n\nNow are they comfy? Are they are a big old chunky platform okay.\n\nAnd if you get tired in the party, you can just literally wrap that around your head. And if you don't want to talk to people, just\n\ncover it up. Wait. I love a man wearing at least some platforms\n\nbecause we're this close to tearing an ACL at all times, and Men Don't Understand has never been the same.\n\nNo, if Prince can do it, then we should all be able to do it. I love Prince, he was a big inspiration in\n\nthis look tonight. Yes. Oh my God.\n\nUm, also, do you get annoyed with people saying your eyes are beautiful?\n\nI appreciate it, that wasn't a compliment. No, you were just saying that was a statement.\n\nJust a statement. I am very grateful. No, JP, we love you.\n\nThank you for coming and getting that party. You're awesome. So much fun.\n\nAh, JP, which does sound like a lacrosse player. JP I did, um, tan back to you.\n\nGood one. Hannah, thank you so much. I am now joined by Conan and his lovely wife,\n\nLiza. Hi, guys. It's a big night for you.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was really fun.\n\nOkay. Was it fun going in, or is it fun now that it's over?\n\nUh, it was fun when you get to hit the stage. Okay. And then before.\n\nThat is a lot of worrying and work. Okay. A lot of worrying and work.\n\nAnd Liza was very patient. Well, the funny thing is, last couple of months, because I've been a little bit of a\n\nmental case, but once you get on the stage and you're ready, it's fun.\n\nConan, um, I know that this is about you right now, but I need your wife's opinion.\n\nCan you tell me the real, real. What's he like preparing for something like this?\n\nIs he wildly frustrating at home? Not frustrating, not frustrating, not frustrating.\n\nJust very. I have my moments. Does he does he hard working and focused?\n\nAre you his sounding board? Not alone. There are many people who make up the sound.\n\nShe's not the only sounding, but I try a lot of material out on on Liza. But are you honest?\n\nIf you're not feeling something he's going to include. Oh, God.\n\nYeah. No, we had a joke, which I won't repeat, but are you sure you can?\n\nIt's a safe space here. No, no, no, I don't trust you. I don't trust any of you.\n\nUh, but, um, Liza was like, nah, I don't think that's the right way to go. And she was right, and she was right.\n\nAnd it was a joke that the writers really liked. But we got I got rid of it because you\n\nweren't feeling it, and I'm really glad I did. Every writer's favorite way.\n\nNow tell me when you watch him, when he starts to present. Sorry.\n\nWhen he starts to host the Oscars, are you sat there thinking, come on, you can do it. You can do it.\n\nLike, are you a proud, never nervous. Wow. Not at all.\n\nWow. I have faith in him above pretty much anything else.\n\nWill you marry me? Absolutely. I'm a very homosexual man, but very welcoming\n\nin this relationship. It could be a throuple I would love. I've always wanted to be a throuple.\n\nAnd I love my husband. He's great, but he's okay in my life. He's all right.\n\nHe lives for my life. I want to just talk about your hair before we kiss you off.\n\nYeah. Your hair's not as high as it typically is. And I need you to know that I had very high\n\nhair. Also, you know it. It's the weather.\n\nOkay. And my hair is barometric. My hair is barometric.\n\nSo when the hair. When it's humid, when it's just right, it fluffs up, and then it can fall down\n\nsometimes. Conan, you. I don't know if you know, but I had a version\n\nof your hair, so I'm on a Netflix show, and people used to compare me to you constantly. I was the Brown Conan.\n\nYes. And then only a few months ago, I changed it. My question before you leave is, would you\n\never go for something a little different other than the quiff? I think it's too late.\n\nI did it. I went with this a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nAll right, all right. Well, on that, we'll let you go. Thank you so much for a lovely evening.\n\nCongratulations for tonight. That's amazing. And thanks for having us.\n\nLovely to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you everyone.\n\nNow we're going back to Hannah and Bedhead.\n\nThe best of me. I am newly in the Redhead Club. Yes.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Hi. It's nice here.\n\nI do have to say, I watched your documentary on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was so inspired. After that, I wanted I could take over the world.\n\nI'm so sorry. What was your inspiration behind this? Yeah, I just really wanted to give.\n\nLike, she's baring it all at Vanity Fair. Eco friendly. You're crushing.\n\nShe's definitely giving poison ivy. Yes, yes, yes. Green is crushing it.\n\nAnd I love a feather I freakin love. Look at that. The body is body.\n\nNo. It's body. Oh, my God, I'm obsessed.\n\nSo when you go in this party, are you dancing or are you just holding it tight? Posing.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. I'm standing still. I'm giving statue.\n\nI'm giving Oscar. I feel like they have to pay to, like, see you perform.\n\nI told you that was a different live stream. Yeah, yeah. Don't.\n\nDon't do that for free. That's crazy. I do it for the hotties everywhere, though.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, you do it for the girls. And we appreciate that.\n\nYeah. You give so much confidence to women everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not feeling confident? I start my day with you and only you.\n\nOh my God. I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.\n\nWe're lying. No I know. No.\n\nYour music has literally, like, made me want. When I want to fight someone. I listen to your music.\n\nYou want to throw that fighting out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad.\n\nWhen people are talking, I go turn on Megan. Body ody ody. I look beautiful.\n\nI look so great. Wait. No.\n\nYou look so good when you're. But I know because I watched your documentary.\n\nYou've been through so many dark things. How do you get yourself up and inspire people?\n\nI've never seen her this passionate. I just look in the mirror and I'll be like, damn you, that girl.\n\nYeah, right. Yeah, you are that girl. So go outside and act like you're that girl.\n\nNo, we love you. That's how I tackle my day. That I'm crying would be the one that made me\n\ncry. I'll take my pictures. Don't cry.\n\nCry. Do you cry a lot? I do cry.\n\nI'm a crier, I love that. What's your sign? I'm an Aquarius.\n\nOh, I don't cry much when I cry for a reason. Yes, you let it go. Well, keep, keep like letting it all into\n\nyour music. Never, never, never stop. I want to know.\n\nThat was so good. Come on girl. No.\n\nI know we've been staring yourself all the time. Meg, what are you wearing, though?\n\nWhen you're, like, just writing new music. What are you wearing? Big t shirt and panties.\n\nA big t shirt. Like, with stains on it and stuff. No.\n\nNo stains. Oh, sorry. That was me.\n\nLike the perfect big getting ready t shirt. No, just a plain white t shirt. Yeah, or like a graphic T or something.\n\nOne of my favorite celebrities on it or something. Okay.\n\nMy panties. Yeah, yeah, you are, as you should. Your thong.\n\nGranny thong. Always okay. Cheeks always out.\n\nCheeks out. Um, Meg, go in there. You've spent way too much time with us.\n\nWe love you so much. Somebody said they stole my place in line, I gotta go.\n\nOh, oh, oh, I think we should end every stream with cheeks. I'm joined by John Mulaney and Olivia Munn.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for being here. You've been part of iconic SNL moments.\n\nHow did it feel to be back for the 50th anniversary special? Are there any behind the scenes memories that\n\nyou're still laughing about? Um, there was a great pep talk in the cue card department before we started the three\n\nhour show, where they had stacks of cue cards about as high as me and Wally.\n\nThe cue card guy told everyone to just have fun. And everyone laughed because no one was\n\nreally going to have fun until the show was over. The show is over.\n\nYeah. That's great. And John, your Netflix talk show is coming\n\nback in a few weeks. If you could have any guest on the show, living or dead, who would be your dream to\n\ninterview and why? Oh, that's a good question. David Bowie would be my dream guest.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good one. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd between the two of you, who's more likely to end up leading the charge to the dance floor tonight.\n\nIt would be me. 100%. But everyone knows that on site.\n\nI love that. Thank you both so much. Have an amazing night.\n\nHave a great night. Nice to see you. Nice to see you.\n\nOh my goodness. We're live. We are live with the one and only Nate\n\nBargatze, who's changing the world for comedy right now.\n\nThey don't let most comedians in, especially stand ups, because most of us are dirty. Yeah.\n\nHow did you get into this event? You know, I got I got invited this year, I got invited, I feel I still have it.\n\nSo I feel like this is the gateway to the Oscars. Yeah.\n\nSo if you can get here. Yes. Then maybe five years from now, I can get\n\ninto five years, like. Yeah. I figure it's a long plan, but, yeah, I'll be\n\na good game. It's a long game. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So how involved is your wife? Your wife in your fits?\n\nLike, does she give opinions? Yeah, she helps me out. Like she said, put that brooch on and you\n\nsaid okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't have even known that was a brooch if you wouldn't have pointed at it. I would have been like, I don't know what\n\nshe's talking. I go, I go, she's a page, right? Pages.\n\nLose her mind here. Lost her mind. I won't make you spell it, but yeah.\n\nNo, it is a brooch. I saw a lot of people had them. Yeah, there's a lot of guys.\n\nWell, actually, not a lot of people did, because you're wearing it now. All the men are going to start wearing them.\n\nYeah, yeah. Out of the bar. Trendsetters.\n\nThis is where it starts. At the bar. Do you ever.\n\nDo you ever come to these events and you're like, wow. I'm like one of the only comedians.\n\nDo you ever say a joke that just, like, doesn't land with all the respected actors? Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, if they don't know the context of, like, me being a comic, you can say something, especially a long story that can.\n\nOh, yeah. That's hard. Like, you will know when you know it's not\n\ngoing to hit even really hear you. You get out of it. They get their security and they're like, can\n\nyou get this guy? I'll wait till someone drags him off, and then I get back to them and go, let me finish\n\nwhat I was. Yeah. Let me get back into it.\n\nSo he golfs with some very famous people all the time.\n\nUm, do you have any advice for dealing with pressure on the golf course and on stage?\n\nBecause you're a calm man. You're a calm man. Like I gotta call you the Ice Man.\n\nIs that. Do they? Yes.\n\nAll right. Oh, God. He lived right.\n\nYeah. I don't know who he is. Uh, the ice man.\n\nWell, isn't that is that, uh, Top Gun?\n\nNate, you've already lost me. I was just trying. Yes, I'm the iceman.\n\nI mean, how do you stay calm before all these intense SNL monologue? Yeah.\n\nIt's, uh, you know, you prepare. Yeah. That's all you do.\n\nIf I get out of the preparation, I'll be in big trouble. And you study hard.\n\nHe goes. Maybe work hard for once. Maybe try a little harder.\n\nYeah. Just give it a shot. Have an idea of what you're going to do.\n\nNate, thank you so much. We love you so much. Thank you so much.\n\nWe can't wait to watch your next special. Thank you very much. Yeah.\n\nPleasure. Great seeing you again. Yes.\n\nPleasure. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nHave fun today. Hello.\n\nOh my gosh. We're joined by Jay Ellis. I don't know why I jumped like that.\n\nThat was weird. That was very weird. I just have to say, we've interviewed a lot\n\nof men. Best dressed. Oh, you're my best dressed.\n\nAnd she never. She never says that. And I never compliment a man.\n\nIt's against my religion. I really I can't do it. Oh, my velvet, the satin.\n\nOh, it's so good. I appreciate it. Brunello Cuccinelli, are you single?\n\nI'm not. I'm very married. Oh.\n\nMe too. Very happy. What?\n\nWhat do I not look like? I could trap a man. Well, why did you ask me if I was?\n\nShe's looking for someone. I'm a wingman. I got some homeboys.\n\nOh, okay. Amazing. Thank you.\n\nI'm Paige, I'm doing the live stream. You send them right over to me. Wait.\n\nStart a group chat. You guys look, like, in the same color. Yeah.\n\nWe do. No. I'm obsessed.\n\nWe do? You guys have the same stylist. This looks good.\n\nI love it. So, did you want the red or did your stylist force it on you?\n\nIt looks great. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, I don't know that.\n\nI thought about the pocket square, to be honest with you. The red is a nice pop, though.\n\nIt does look good. That's how you know. You didn't think about it.\n\nYou didn't even know he was wearing one. Alessio, over at Brunello and Jason Bolden, my stylist, they they they they conspired and\n\ncollabed and then they sent it to you. This whole thing. They said, hey, put this on.\n\nYou said, okay. And I said, okay. Yeah.\n\nHow many different glasses do you own?\n\nWe've all been wanting to know a lot. Yeah, I only take pictures in glasses. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n\nIt makes you look like you know something we don't know. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you preparing? It's like. It's like the English.\n\nIt's like. It's like my version of a British accent. Yes yes yes yes yes yes.\n\nWho sounds so clever and witty? Everything he says sound unprepared because we don't have accents.\n\nWait. My brother. Oh, that's my brother from another.\n\nHe's running over my guy. Come on. He's literally just jumped over Kylie Jenner.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. And now the men are hugging, and now the men are hugging.\n\nI thank you so much for coming out. Yeah. Thank you for stopping by.\n\nI'm not really sure why I came over here, but we don't. We're sorry.\n\nThree minutes of. You can yell at your publicist after because that's what she said.\n\nTraumatizing. And we get it. Three minutes that he'll never forget.\n\nThat's what she said. Get out of here. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.\n\nOh, get out of here with your pocket square. Oh my God. Wait.\n\nNow we're joined by the one and only Tinashe. Oh my God. A vision.\n\nA vision. No, do not apologize to us. This corset is insane.\n\nI think it's insane. No, it's the texture. The color, the fit.\n\nIt's gorgeous. I feel like my rib cage is, like, overlapping right now.\n\nI'm obsessed. Wait, you have a sexual energy I can. It's radiating off you.\n\nNot only on the carpet, but in your music. Have you always, like, had just been sexy?\n\nHonestly, I feel like music is a great outlet for me to, like, bring that sex appeal, that ego, that alter ego.\n\nHonestly, I feel like in my day to day life, I'm like very chill, very toned down. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like with my music, I feel like I can, like, walk, you know. So okay, you say like in your day to day,\n\nyou're toned down. So like, you're not going to the grocery store in this.\n\nUnfortunately not. What's your like normal day style. Like on sweatpants?\n\nYeah. Sweatpants. Hoodie.\n\nYeah. All the things. Like the comfiest clothes, no bra.\n\nYeah. So do you like getting dressed up for stuff like this, or are you, like, my feet hurt?\n\nI mean, it's nice. It's nice to be able to, like, have the range.\n\nYeah, the range to do both. Get a girl who can do both. Who do you like better?\n\nMusicians or actors? I thought you were gonna say me or you. And I was like, please answer.\n\nWe're live.\n\nWe are not going to tell anyone. We won't tell. I honestly, I actors are kind of chill, I\n\nlike them. Yeah. I do have to say.\n\nYeah. Musicians, some of them are a little. They are larger than life at times.\n\nYou have a lot of feelings they can be. I was going to say they can be quite emotional.\n\nOh my God, I dated one. He cried so much, but it was my fault. Yeah.\n\nWhen you go in there, what's your vibe? Are you a wallflower? Are you dancing?\n\nI'm going straight for the champagne. Yes. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.\n\nYes. Where I should be? Yes.\n\nJust bopping and grooving. I love it so much. Are you going to ask for a selfie from\n\nanyone? Or is that like, oh my gosh, I am so not the ask for selfies type.\n\nYeah, neither are we. Like in the bathroom in there. Are you ever just like, oh, and that's\n\nKendall Jenner chill. I'm like, oh my God, I've seen you all. You're all friends.\n\nYou're like, does anyone want a tampon? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n\nYou're like, everyone's a human inside. I'm like, oh my God. But you know, keep it chill.\n\nYeah. You always look so good with your fists. Are you very opinionated with your stylist?\n\nLike, I want to wear this. Yes, definitely. You have to be girl.\n\nYou have to be especially. I feel like once you've done a couple of carpets and you come out looking crazy.\n\nYeah, you know that you can't do that anymore. And you have to be kind of decisive.\n\nWell, you crushed it tonight. You truly did. We loved you so much.\n\nLook so beautiful. Thank you so much. So much fun in there.\n\nAnd we love your freckles. Yes. You could not be cuter.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Have fun and.\n\nYeah. Have fun. Get out of here.\n\nThank you so much for being here. Um, John, we've seen you at a few Vanity Fair parties.\n\nAre there any standout moments that still make you laugh when you think about them? I was here for the slap.\n\nWe were here for the slap. We were here for the mix up. The La La Land mix up.\n\nSo yeah, there's been quite a few standout moments in the bathroom during this lap. Yes, I was in the in the bathroom for both of\n\nthose, but I saw the aftermath. Yes, Ron Howard gave us the play by play. Never go to the bathroom at the end of the\n\nshow. It's going to. It's going to come back to haunt you.\n\nYeah. Oh my gosh, that's wild. Um, and you've both done drama and comedy.\n\nIf you could swap roles with one of your characters for a day, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, jeez. I mean, I don't think I'd want to swap characters, swap places with Don Draper.\n\nThat'd be a real bummer. Um, but I don't know, maybe. Maybe the guy in in Top Gun.\n\nThat'd be pretty fun. Run an aircraft carrier or something?\n\nI have to say, my character from Mad Men, because that would be great.\n\nThat's a good one to be in 1970. In Big sur. So it sounds like a fun time.\n\nYes. Thank you guys so much for being here. Have an amazing night.\n\nYou look. You look amazing. Thank you.\n\nYes. Beautiful color. I am now joined by the hottest couple in\n\ntown. Actually, in the world. We have dove, Cameron and Damiano.\n\nHello, guys. How are you? We're so good.\n\nHow are you? Very well. Thanks.\n\nQuestion. Did we plan the outfits together? Did we want to coordinate?\n\nYes. I knew I was going to be all black. And he.\n\nHe had a secret wish for me also to be all black. Do you typically get to decide first?\n\nI had a fever dream. I came to her and I was like, I want to be like the Beckhams.\n\nWow. So that we're we're working on it. That's a really good inspo.\n\nThat's a wonderful inspo. Now we off camera, we were talking about this and I just want to hit it real hard.\n\nYour style evolution, you were always great, but you were grungier and now you're going for a lot more classic.\n\nWhat was the what was the the impetus for this?\n\nUh, it looks like we are a new band, but we've been actually doing it for quite a lot, and I just need.\n\nI just felt like I needed something different and I needed to be more focused on, like, what I really want to do.\n\nIt's so chic. It's almost like 50s inspired that you're that you're rocking now.\n\nI love it so much, dove. I know we all know what a rock star you are, but is it awkward when you're, like, at a\n\nconcert and everyone's going nuts for this one? No, not at all.\n\nI'm usually the one going the most nuts. I listen, I'm just as obsessed, so I totally get it.\n\nI can listen, I would love to really talk to you, dove, but it's really hard to look at. If you could see close up what I'm seeing,\n\nit's so difficult to look at her. Brown people don't blush easily. But under my skin.\n\nYou are a knockout. Me knockout. It's fine.\n\nI'm a very gay man. He's perfectly safe. I've never dabbled in that.\n\nRight. Do you know Teyana Taylor, by any chance? Yes.\n\nYou're absolutely beautiful. Hi. Come say hi.\n\nJoin us. Hi, love. Hi.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you guys. I'm gonna let you guys go. Thank you for joining me.\n\nIt was so good to meet you both. Can I get one mic? Yes.\n\nLovely to see you guys, darling. Hello, darling. How are you?\n\nOkay, I'm going to help you talk. Talk to me about this number.\n\nHold on. What's going on? I see some needle and thread.\n\nOh, no. Okay, listen. In the car.\n\nI'm gonna. I'm gonna do this. Oh, damn.\n\nThe back's even better. Are you willing to show the back?\n\nYou guys, can we see that on camera, please? Damn.\n\nHave you seen that? Okay. Who are we wearing?\n\nLaquan smith. Oh, we love Laquan Smith. Is this custom?\n\nYes, it is runway. Okay. Question.\n\nYou've been to this event many times. Yes. Are you still intimidated by that?\n\nYes I am. See, I'm, like, nervous right now. I'm so shy and people don't know that I don't\n\nbelieve in Red Carpet. I'm trying to practice how I'm going to post up, like, okay, do I stand like this?\n\nDo I? Okay, here's the problem. So I practice my poses in the mirror.\n\nAnd then as soon as I get onto the red carpet and they're shouting, you forget it all. They'll be like, can you stand right here?\n\nI'll be like, okay, I know. And you look back thinking, that was one of my poses, man, it's a dirty game.\n\nWhy do we work on right now? You acted last year or the year before?\n\nLast year. Okay. Are we working on a new movie?\n\nWorking on a new project. Are we focusing on music?\n\nEverything. Yeah, I actually have three movies coming this year.\n\nAnd a show with Ryan Murphy I'm very, very excited about. Where are you finding the time?\n\nOh, baby, I don't even know. You're working every hour that God sends. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, literally filming multiple things at once. And.\n\nAre you recording my music? Um.\n\nStay tuned. Let's see. That's a yes.\n\nThat's a yes, folks. We know how to read through that. Thank you so much.\n\nOkay, read the carpet. I'm gonna to try and get too many secrets out if I don't let her go.\n\nSo, Tiana, I'm gonna kiss you off for now. You look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nThe incomparable Tiana.\n\nWe are so excited to be here with Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nWhat up? Okay, I can't drive. I don't have my driver's license.\n\nAn interview question, am I right? Do you have any advice for looking cool when driving?\n\nUh, do it right. Don't like hit people and stuff? Yeah, don't hit people.\n\nKeep your eye on the road. Keep your emotions to yourself.\n\nWell, we just found out she's from Jersey, so. And they learned that in Jersey to keep their\n\nemotions to themselves. I'm super stoked. You know, we got a Jersey boy as a winner for\n\nbest picture today. Yes. No.\n\nThat's so exciting. I love new Jersey I love Sean Baker, he's awesome.\n\nYes. Represent Sean so good. And how do you think the accents were?\n\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn too, and I thought they nailed it. It was pretty intense.\n\nYeah, yeah I he has a he has a tendency to pick like real, real people for the role. And then, you know, they always just come to\n\nthe table with great performances. I think every film that he's ever directed, he's just really he just knows how to capture\n\ntruth. You know what I mean? And you can feel it when you watch any of his\n\nfilms. So yeah, I'm super happy for him. Yes.\n\nShout out to Sean and Michelle. You've taken on so many badass female roles. Is there something you look for in particular\n\nwhen you're, like, reading scripts? Yeah. You know, because.\n\nBecause of the last name. Yeah. And because I'm a woman I've always had to\n\nbattle for the last 25 years. Cartels. Hookers.\n\nUm, maids. Anything that's poverty porn.\n\nSo I stay away from all that stuff. I basically, you know, I don't like to, uh, representation matters.\n\nIt really does. Well, what you're saying, what you're doing with your presence, I think matters.\n\nYou know, if I were, like, if everybody were doing, you know, amazing work and we had lots of representation.\n\nI could probably be an actress and not so much an activist, but for the last, you know, 25 years that's been pretty much my you're\n\nvery purposeful with the roles you take, for sure. I kind of have to be because nobody, you\n\nknow, there's not a lot of people doing it. So you got to kind of like, and you do not want to be just.\n\nYeah, squared into one place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nNo. And speaking of not boring. No, we have to talk about your fashion\n\nbecause the cape. I'm obsessed. It's so powerful.\n\nAnd I love that. It's, like, tight and then, like, flaring out a little.\n\nAnd this is the color of the season. You're so on trend. Yeah.\n\nHow did you pick this? Was it between a couple or. You know Hugo is amazing.\n\nAnd he's he's the fantastic genius behind it all.\n\nBecause you know me, I'm such a tomboy. No, you wouldn't know it in this dress. You wouldn't know it.\n\nGorgeous. Is there a story behind this necklace? Because it's cool.\n\nYeah. Um. So, um, Basically, I get this jewelry from\n\nthis Polish designer who 3D prints everything. Wait.\n\nSo cool. Macabre. And so I have all of his jewelry remade in\n\ngold and silver. Wow. A true Jersey girl.\n\nA jersey figuring it out. Michelle, keep rocking it. I'm obsessed with you.\n\nI look up to you and have fun inside, okay? Beautiful night. Thank you for stopping by with us.\n\nThank you. Tan. Back to you.\n\nOh. Thank you. Hey, kid.\n\nThank you so much. And here's another star lighting up this red carpet.\n\nWe have Ciara and Russell. Hi, guys. How are you?\n\nAmazing parents night off. Yeah, basically, babies are in bed.\n\nI get it. It really is what it is. Like.\n\nYou put your kids to bed and you're like, now it's our time. What do Mom and dad do on a night off other\n\nthan this? Oh, well, we have too much fun.\n\nNever too much, I'm sure. We love our good date nights. We love a good meal.\n\nThat's like my love language. I love good food, but can you go out or do you have people in?\n\nWe go out. Yeah we do. We do a date night every Friday.\n\nSo we make sure that we spend that quality time, which is good, especially when she's looking like this and wearing this kind of\n\ndress. Listen, I have been a gay man my entire life, but Sierra is one of the very few people on\n\nthis planet I've seen thinking, what is it about this lady that's doing something to my heart?\n\nI don't know. Since I was a kid, you've been. Oh, just phenomenal.\n\nCan you talk about what's going on in your life right now when it comes to work? Oh my gosh, so much.\n\nI'm excited. I just kind of had a fun session with Tyga on his live stream the other night.\n\nYeah. So you guys got to see us do our song in real time and record our song Dance With me in\n\nreal time. But I have a new song called ecstasy coming up, and it is the ultimate just everything.\n\nIt's like the big sister to my song Ride and Promise for my die hard fans, and I'm super excited for it.\n\nSo videos, grinding everything, my skincare OEM, my rum 10 to one loving on my amazing husband that you have been.\n\nAre you also her biggest fan when it comes to her music? Of course she plays.\n\nYou loved her music ever since. One, two step and goodies. Don't get me started.\n\nI think that we just have a great time just to be able to raise kids and do this. And obviously we're also getting the\n\nproduction space too, with new productions. And so we're getting going. We're excited about some things we have going\n\non. I don't know why you two find the time to do all that and still look this good, but there\n\nis a lot going on behind us. So you were getting that line. Enjoy the night.\n\nThank you so much. It was lovely to see you both. Thank you.\n\nAlways good to see you. Oh my gosh. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you my darling. I'll take those from you. Thank you.\n\nMwah mwah. Bye, mate. Good to see you, man.\n\nThank you so much. Hello. Hi, guys.\n\nDo you know these guys? Oh my God.\n\nMwah, mwah. Hi. Such such a fan.\n\nThank you. Oh, you guys.\n\nIcons. Hi. Excuse me.\n\nSir. How dare you? I can't okay?\n\nWow. I love that there's no chit chat. No.\n\nNo chit chat. I'm going to keep you company. Don't worry about it.\n\nI'm a big I'm a big NFL fan, so I'm fangirling. So yes, excited to meet me because you know\n\nwhat a sportsman I am. Completely. I took one look at you and I was like, he's a\n\nquarterback. She asked me. She was like, do you know you look like Joe\n\nBurrow? I go, have you seen my Halloween costume? Oh, man.\n\nYeah. Actually, I would never have thought it until right now.\n\nYou are so right. Yes. But also, I don't look like Joe Burrow.\n\nJoe Burrow looks like me. Yeah. Gantlet has been thrown.\n\nI'm older, I'm older. You guys, did you watch any of the show tonight?\n\nOf course. Okay. I mean, just the best supporting actor.\n\nThat's the only thing I watched that was. I mean, true story. True story.\n\nWell, how did you text Paul? Like, what's the deal when. When your sibling wins an Oscar?\n\nNo, I cried, and I was like, I'm going to see you later. Yeah, yeah.\n\nWill you be seeing him here? What's that? Will you be seeing him here?\n\nIs this the first time? I don't know, he's busy. He's a busy man.\n\nHe's Academy Award winning actor Kieran Culkin. He's the guy.\n\nHe's crazy. It is. That is wild.\n\nYeah, yeah. Did you expect it? Of course.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Okay. Are you kidding me?\n\nHe was. He was front row aisle, closest to the stairs.\n\nThere was no way he was not going to win. I was like, we're allowed to say this. You are.\n\nYou are? No, no. It's family.\n\nYeah. Was there any other movie that you watched this year that you were like, this could\n\npotentially win it? Oh, goodness.\n\nI'm thinking fallout season two. No, no. I mean, I don't know.\n\nThese movies were all incredible. So it's really. I feel like you could just throw it up in the\n\nair. We're all winners here. Anora by any chance?\n\nWinners. Like it was. It was so good.\n\nIt was so good. Okay. When it comes to fashion.\n\nYes. You're looking fantastic. You're looking gorgeous.\n\nMy question is, do you help him? Absolutely.\n\nWe do. We help each other. I always ask for his opinion, but at the end\n\nof the day, I was like, he can wear anything, so it's really easy.\n\nAnd she looks, she she looks like $1 billion with a capital B. Thank you honey.\n\nYeah. I can't handle how good. No, I can't handle how good you look.\n\nAll right. What are you wearing, honey? Tell us.\n\nI don't know exactly. I know, I don't know. I'm going to get in trouble for getting in\n\ntrouble. The funny thing is, we never asked that because so many people forget.\n\nI actually don't know. Ask you that. Okay, go.\n\nEnjoy the party. We'll see you in there. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd congratulations to your brother. Oh, wow. Congratulations to my brother, tan.\n\nYou're so fun. Back to us. We took a little nap and we are now here with\n\nKaia Gerber. The gorgeous, gorgeous, stunning. No, you literally look like an angel.\n\nJust came down to earth. Okay, I have to tell you, I'm obsessed with you in Palm Royale.\n\nOh. Thank you. No, guys, if you don't watch the show, do\n\nyourself a favor. Stream it right now. Yes.\n\nNot for. Don't watch for me. Watch for Carol Burnett and Ricky Martin and\n\nKristen Wiig. Watch for Kia. I feel like this is kind of giving that vibe.\n\nOh, my gosh, you look amazing. I can't believe this is happening.\n\nYou look so, so, so good. Oh my gosh.\n\nNo, I saw you walk in. I was like, of course it's Coleman. You look so good.\n\nOh, no. Please interrupt. Take it.\n\nYou're more interesting than me. Oh, here we go. Coleman normally hates attention.\n\nBut he's here today. Hi. How are you?\n\nI saw two of the guys, and I just had to always know.\n\nColeman is actually the best. Dressed forever in all ways. You are?\n\nPlease. You're really. You look like art.\n\nI love you. You look like art. I love you.\n\nCongratulations. Thank you so much. I'm so happy for you.\n\nI feel like you guys are my parents, and I'm obsessed. I'm like, can I come home with you guys?\n\nCan you actually wait? They were like, oh, you can wait until Kaya's done.\n\nNo, no, no, no, I got to go. Please take over. Please take over.\n\nThis is so much better.\n\nWho are you wearing tonight? It's vintage Valentino. Coleman, what are you wearing?\n\nI was doing our job earlier, but now. Now, now I'm wearing. Because, you know, we're Valentino folks.\n\nExactly. But I'm wearing Dolce Gabbana tonight. The gloves.\n\nThe gloves that. Oh, wait. Are you kidding?\n\nWait. Coleman, we've taken over. We've fully taken over there.\n\nI have a cat at home. You have a cat? Do you have a cat?\n\nI don't have a cat. I just need one. But my husband calls me the cat, so I wear\n\ncat things. You know. Exactly.\n\nSo. Yeah, but this is like I wanted this this outfit to be called good night.\n\nIt's like. Good night. Oscars.\n\nGood night. Shut it down now. Are you sweating?\n\nNo, no, he doesn't sweat. Colman Domingo doesn't sweat. Coleman.\n\nSweat. If you do anything illegal. No, there's no fingerprints.\n\nThat's why the gloves. Precisely. And that's why we're amateurs at these\n\nthings. You can't steal a snack. I need gloves here.\n\nI need gloves. You don't want to try better next year. That's why I came over here.\n\nI'm like, no gloves. And let's be honest, you don't want to touch us.\n\nBut you're not. We're mere mortals. We look like idiots without gloves.\n\nMore gloves. I'm out of here. We miss the glove memo.\n\nYeah. Yeah. All right, keep going.\n\nGet gloves. This was it. I think we've done it.\n\nYeah, we've done it. We did it. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. That was.\n\nOh my God. That was the best thing ever. I mean, yeah, great.\n\nI Oscar you're getting so into acting. You were just in the SNL movie. I was.\n\nAnd we were talking about. She loves comedians and comedy. I think you're going to have a stand up\n\nspecial soon. Absolutely not. That's why I'm friends with stand up\n\ncomedians, because they make me funnier. I was in bottom. You were incredible.\n\nI was in bottoms. Okay. I feel like people ask you this all the time,\n\nbut modeling or acting, you got to pick one. What are we doing? I couldn't possibly do that.\n\nThe thing is, you. All your actors are in campaigns, so, you know, you don't have to choose one.\n\nWow. She's right. All your favorite actors are on billboards.\n\nYou're right. You don't ever have to pick one thing. Being multi-hyphenate.\n\nUm, Kia. Thank you for having me. I can't believe, Colman.\n\nThank you for coming. That was amazing. That was pretty cool.\n\nThank you, thank you. Get out of here. A microphone.\n\nNo one should ever do that. Oh, we'll take it. Yeah.\n\nAll right, so here with me is Kathryn Hahn. Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nUm, do you have any group text chats still going from any of your projects? Oh, yeah, a bunch.\n\nI have one from Glass Onion that we still talk all the time. All of them.\n\nI think Edward is up for an award tonight. We're all very excited for him and for everyone.\n\nI have one for the studio. I think he just wants to talk to you about it.\n\nYeah. And, um. Uh, one for Agatha.\n\nYeah. I love a group chat after it's gone. I get very sad when something's over, so it\n\nmakes me happy to continue on with the group. It's like a family. Yes.\n\nIt is. Oh. That's amazing.\n\nAnd have you ever been to this party before? A few times, but it's every time as overwhelming as the time before.\n\nOkay. Just by the sheer amount of star wattage.\n\nYeah. It's true. It's true.\n\nConsolidated into one place. Yeah. It's overwhelming.\n\nI remember the first time I was like, I couldn't even make eye contact because it was too much in one room.\n\nIt's true. No, I know that's how I'm feeling. Yeah.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself, but. Well, good luck and thank you. And thank you so much.\n\nPain gowns. I know we're matching. We're matching this evening.\n\nYou look fabulous. It's so nice to meet you. You too.\n\nThank you for the link between us. Guys, welcome to our new home. It's.\n\nYeah, this is our new sitcom, and it's. We're all married. Straight to series.\n\nSisters from another Mister. Hello. We are so excited to be here.\n\nI just want to say, Bowen and you as well. Did you guys just fly here from a second ago?\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift. Yeah. Jet lag is a construct, a construct.\n\nHonestly, it's for mentally weak people. He got on a 6 a.m.. What is it, 6 a.m.?\n\nFlight to land. JetBlue. You're welcome.\n\nBecause you're a man of the people. I'm a man of the people. My carbon footprint is going to be\n\ndistributed evenly. Yes. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. It's important. Congrats.\n\nLast night was amazing. You two have incredible chemistry. Yeah.\n\nHow long? Now. Come on.\n\nHave you guys actually been friends? Like for real? The year 2008 and then 2009, you had a big\n\nfight when Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj came out.\n\nThat's when that's important. We really. That's your anniversary.\n\nYou're both off book on the same Nicki Minaj songs. And then it was like, okay, because our\n\nfriends were like, I was in the sketch group. He was in the improv group. We were both gay and they were like, be\n\nfriends. We're like, no, we're not going to be friends just cause we're gay.\n\nAnd then we were friends just for two. They're amazing. Podcast.\n\nI feel like, how the hell have we not met before? Have you been?\n\nI know, I know, it's rude. Okay, this is the scoop. We've been trying to get y'all on the podcast\n\nfor ages. No, no, we're coming tomorrow. We're coming, we're coming on it.\n\nWe're coming tonight. Yeah. This is a podcast.\n\nThis is the podcast. Record it actually. Yes.\n\nMe and Matt have hung out before. We've got. We've been in bed.\n\nIt's crazy. We've gotten in bed. I haven't even gotten a Snapchat.\n\nI haven't gotten anything in these streets. So you guys, when you go in there, do you approach people or just vibe alone?\n\nIt depends. We get a little brave. Like he had to convince me to go up to\n\nSebastian Stan number one talent crush. It was amazing. No, I need to go up to Sebastian Stan.\n\nI'm obsessed. Jawline. Look at us talking.\n\nWe forgot we're in. We're actually we're. This is a job we have to do.\n\nWe literally forgot when you guys go in there, we you when you guys go in there, do you separate like, do you break and then come\n\nback? No, no, I'm, I'm glomming on to this one. Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah. Who's more outgoing? It depends on the context.\n\nYou guys are both quite shy.\n\nYeah. You're kind of. You give wallflower.\n\nWait. Have you guys ever hooked up accidentally? No.\n\nNever. No. We keep it.\n\nWe're sisters. Us neither. But like, the night is young.\n\nYou got to talk to this. We're at Vanity Fair. You want to hook up with Amelia?\n\nI love how he's like. Please stop talking to us. No, no, no, we've been eating up so much\n\nairtime. You have to talk to her. No.\n\nAmelia, come. Hello. It's a literal party.\n\nOh, my God, all these funny hot people. I know it's too many. Too many hot, too many hot funny people.\n\nOh, we're getting there. We love you. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGood luck on your pictures. Good luck. I have to let you guys know.\n\nAmelia Dimoldenberg. And I love how they put how to pronounce my name.\n\nDemi Moore. And let's be honest, everyone, everyone says Amelia Demi Moore.\n\nAnd you know exactly who we're talking about. It's Amelia. Dims.\n\nAmelia dims. We went up to you two days ago and said, do you have any advice for the carpet?\n\nYeah. Can I tell you I was very starstruck meeting you the other night.\n\nI'm just very. Is that why I thought you were shy? I am shy, but I'm just very impressed by you.\n\nI was watching you on the television yesterday when I was trying to prep, and I was trying to relax, and you were just on\n\nBravo, and I was like, oh, my God, there you are. You relaxed.\n\nDid it relax you? Absolutely relaxed. Me.\n\nNothing like really hot, funny people in a house to relax me.\n\nNo. Amelia. How does it feel to be interviewed?\n\nYeah, guys, I feel like I'm like, I just had a tequila shot.\n\nI'm feeling. Where is everyone getting the tequila? Yeah.\n\nNo one's offered us over to us. I feel like. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, but then, anyway, um, it feels great to be interviewed, actually, because it's a\n\nbit of a switch to me doing all the questions.\n\nCan I call it out, though? Amelia obviously crushing it in comedy. A journalistic icon, but fashion wise,\n\nyes, it's next level. I'm screenshotting all her looks. This is gorgeous.\n\nGuys, this has, like, texture to it. Yeah, I feel like they're not getting the vibe.\n\nYeah, it actually feels good. It's almost like an animal. It's giving the British JLo I said it.\n\nWait, what? I said. And now we've said it.\n\nObsessed. And now we've said it. Obsessed.\n\nI just said it. Okay. Obsessed.\n\nNow my head's gonna explode. Wait, how? How are you guys?\n\nSee? She's turning it. Turning it?\n\nNo one. No one's asked that yet. No one's asked us.\n\nAnd we haven't. We don't really like reflecting on our own feelings because then we get into a dark\n\nplace. It's true. But I feel like you're killing it.\n\nWe're trying our best, and we haven't looked at the comments yet. We'll find out soon.\n\nDon't read the comments. Our team is going like this constantly. Keep going.\n\nAmelia. Get in there and we'll ",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Photo: David Neman / Courtesy of the photographer and SSON Photo: David Neman / Courtesy of the photographer and SSON\n\nIn Stockholm last weekend, a pre-spring afternoon was transformed from ho-hum to huzzah with an innovative fashion show for the one-year-old label SSON. It started on the Skanstull subway platform and continued up the stairs and through the streets of Södermalm, wrapping up at the cozy headquarters of Kvartalsrapport (the event organizers), about a five minute walk away. The goings-on were livestreamed from iPhones from four different spots along the route and shared via Twitch so those in the studio (where Bem Subot performed a sound piece), and others, like me logging on from home an ocean away, could watch things unfold.The idea of “democratic” fashion and the need for alternatives to the back-and-forth of traditional runways have been trending topics of late. Here was an event that addressed both concerns as well as sustainability.\n\nSSON, fall 2025 ready-to-wear\n\nSON was founded in 2024 by Yulia Kjellsson and her business partner Ellinor Håkansson, with a mission of doing things differently. “We want to prove that you can do fashion without compromising. And you can work with already existing material and keep [everything that] is exciting about fashion, but without causing harm basically,” the designer explains on a call. “It’s just very interesting to see that there are no limits actually.” While there are some experimental designs in SSON’s first two collections, the emphasis is on tweaked classics—pants, tops, and coats.\n\nSSON (meaning son of) plays on typical Swedish surnames, like Kjellsson, which “is a common worker’s name in Sweden, one that doesn’t have a very high status or is considered beautiful,” says the designer. Her desire to “to change the relationship to common names” runs parallel to what she wants to do with the line in general, which is to transform overlooked things into things that are more than ordinary. The idea is to eventually become scalable.\n\nThough she’s always been creative, Kjellson, 34, says she came late to fashion: “It’s not something that I grew up dreaming about my whole life,” she says. When she was in her early 20s, feeling “young and lost,” the designer inherited her grandmother’s sewing machine, and things took off from there. After studying in Stockholm, she enrolled at ESMOD Berlin, graduating in 2016. Figuring out next steps was tricky; “I really want to work with fashion, but I want to do it in a way that I can really be proud of,” Kjellsson says. “I love the creating part of it, I love the craft, I love the storytelling, but I’m also very interested in politics and society, and I’m a sensitive person and very aware of the times around us and it affects me a lot. I don’t want to have a job that I feel is not contributing to a future for all of us.”",

        "content": "For Versace’s pastel-drenched spring 2025 collection, Donatella Versace nodded to the past, riffing on the house’s spring 1997 Versus show. Yet it was a slightly more recent launch that inspired many of the season’s accessories: a nearly 20-year-old beauty product.\n\nIn 2006, long before most other fashion houses had thrown a hat into the beauty business, Versace launched the fruity-floral scent Bright Crystal. The fragrance still lives on today, with three sister scents: Crystal Noir, Yellow Diamond, and Absolu. At the spring 2025 show, the Bright Crystal bottle appeared on wrists in the form of charm bracelets (with juice inside!), as heel-blocks for mules, and oversized transparent clutches. (The faux bottles were made of plexiglass, rendering them far more sturdy for day-to-day wear than the hand-blown glass used for the fragrance version.)\n\nThe entire collection is now available to shop, wear, and flaunt. I'm partial to the baby-blue slingbacks, which would look fabulous paired with the scent (duh). Genius marketing to remind shoppers that you have a beauty brand? Yes. Also a covetable item for Bright Crystal lovers like myself? Double yes.",

Thanks to her unforgettable portrayal of Kate, a Trump-loving Austin resident who’s on a girl’s trip in Thailand with her friends Jaclyn (Michele Monaghan) and Laurie (Carrie Coon), Bibb has emerged as one of season three’s scene-stealing characters. (A problematic fave, if you will.) I mean, her facial expressions alone have already become a viral meme, not to mention her “cunty little bob” is pretty iconic, too.\n\nOff-screen, however, Bibb is commanding the spotlight in a different way: Her stealthy-chic style during the show’s press tour has been worth taking note of. Working with stylist Jeanann Williams, Bibb has emerged as Hollywood’s freshest new style star, thanks to her impeccable wardrobe of pieces that whisper elegance. Making her talk show rounds this past week, Bibb has favored understated looks that emphasize tailoring and sharp silhouettes—a refreshing change from the glitzy gowns that are usually favored on the circuit.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Mercury going into retrograde is a phenomenon we have observed from Earth for thousands of years and found meaning in. Most simply, if you’re looking at it from Earth, it’s an optical illusion that happens between three and four times a year that makes Mercury appear to move in a backward motion to what it usually does. Since ancient astronomers in the 7th century to today’s TikTok FYPs, we’ve been blaming this astrological moment for our interpersonal problems.\n\nHow can Mercury in retrograde affect us?\n\nWhy are we scared every time Mercury goes into retrograde? The planet Mercury is believed to influence communication—when it moves in a retrograde motion, it’s supposed to trigger more negative impacts, from work miscommunications, to anxiety, and friendship fallouts.\n\nOne of the most major concerns when Mercury is moonwalking is when people embark on a new relationship. Will it be fraught with misreadings and miscommunication? As a professional astrologer, I’m here to tell you not all hope is lost. Though retrograde can bring misunderstandings, travel issues, and brain fog, that doesn’t mean we have to put aside finding love in this time. I always tell my clients: Life has to go on no matter what eclipse, full moon, or retrograde is happening. Putting your best foot forward and being present is always essential, wherever Mercury is in the sky.\n\nWhen is Mercury in retrograde in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, we’ll experience Mercury in retrograde three times: March 15-April 7, July 17-August 10, and November 9-29. Every retrograde has different rules, due to the signs and other planets at play.\n\nWhat should you expect while dating this Mercury retrograde?\n\nThis time around, Mercury retrograde occurs in the signs of tempestuous Aries and tender Pisces. From March 15 to 29, we’ll be more impulsive than ever when Mercury is moving backward in Aries. So, we have a high potential of pulling in someone new in relationships. The caveat is that they could be a past life connection, explaining the immediate familiarity. With Mercury backflipping from March 29 to April 7 in Pisces, we’ll be looking for someone to complete us—if you’re already committed, this marks the deepening of the relationship. If exes reappear, a second chance could be possible.\n\nOn March 22, “The Venus Star Point” (a term coined by the astrologer Arielle Guttman) occurs in the sky when the Sun and Venus link up. This is a fantastic time to meet and appreciate that special person for who they are. As Venus is retrograde in the same signs as Mercury, we want to forge close associations with others and DTR. The way we do so might be more passive than usual, since we want to keep the peace.",

        "content": "Getting a foothold in the fashion industry can be daunting for anyone—but in Christian Allaire’s case, eking out a place for himself as an Ojibwe journalist from the Nipissing First Nation reserve in rural Ontario was especially challenging. As a result, during his tenure as Vogue’s senior fashion and style writer, Allaire has played his position forward, platforming other Indigenous creatives in stories on everything from dream catcher hair to the rise of model Quannah Chasinghorse andVancouver’s Indigenous Fashion Week. Now, in a new memoir, From the Rez to the Runway Forging: My Path in Fashion (Collins), Allaire delves into his profoundly meaningful (and sometimes isolating) experience being a change-maker in his field.\n\nThis week, Vogue spoke to Allaire about building a career spotlighting Indigenous fashion, drawing inspiration from Nlaka’pamux author Terese Marie Mailhot, and what he’d tell his younger self if the two were to meet for coffee.\n\nVogue: How are you feeling about the release of your first memoir?\n\nChristian Allaire: It’s bizarre. You spend so long with a memoir, but you don’t really think about people reading it. So when that time comes, it’s nerve-wracking. It’s very earnest and very raw, so I’m trying not to think about people reading it!\n\nHow does the experience compare to releasing your first book, The Power of Style?\n\nMy first book was very much about championing other people, and this one is very personal and very much focused on me. I don’t really tend to do a lot of writing that’s personal. I much prefer telling other people’s stories, so it was a challenge to do this, because it made me face a lot of things that I probably have been trying not to face.\n\nI was so taken by your description of the contrast between the life that you've built in New York and the life that you describe at home with your family in Canada. What’s helped you unite those two sides of yourself?\n\nLife on the rez is pretty drastically [different from] living in New York. It’s very centered in community and nature and our cultural teachings, so living in a concrete jungle is very much the opposite of that. For me, it’s been about finding fellow Native folks in the city and communing and connecting that way, and having a sounding board for whenever I’m missing certain elements of home or culture. Finding my friends and my people has really helped me bridge those two worlds.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Millie Bobby Brown will be the first to admit that she doesn’t like the prep involved with cooking. Garlic makes her hands smell; onions make her weep. And meat? “I hate, hate, hate cooking meat,” she says. “Some might say, ‘Mille, go be a vegetarian!’ And I’m going to say to that, yeah, I was a vegetarian for a really long time.”\n\nBut despite it all, she loves making her signature dish: a chorizo and chicken paella. Born in Marbella, the Stranger Things actor grew up eating the traditional Spanish dish, which her father often made for dinner.\n\nIn a new Vogue video, Brown walks viewers through the recipe with plenty of colorful commentary—while wearing archival Dolce & Gabbana, no less. “Let’s see what happens today,” she says, facing down a dreaded onion. “But let’s really hope [I don’t cry,] because I have a really strong eye look going on.”\n\nAmid it all, the Stranger Things star also shares a few other things that fans of hers may not know. For one: she owns a number of pet chickens—and was thrilled to find out that Chappell Roan does also. (“Chappell—if you are watching this, know that our chickens could get along,” she says) Also, Brown appeared on Gordon Ramsey’s Hell’s Kitchen when she was nine. And, despite being a massive foodie, she actually forwent a wedding tasting. “I didn’t do anything. Our caterer was Galateo, the most renowned, beautiful catering company in Europe,” she says. “I was like—you got this.” And they did: Brown reports that guests are still talking about this one pasta dish they served at her nuptials to Jake Bongiovi in Tuscany, where she wore a custom gown by Gahlia Lahav.\n\nAlso, she’s loving married life. On a normal day, Bongiovi would be cooking right beside her. “We’re like a trendy trad couple,” she jokes.\n\nDirector: Gabrielle Reich\n\nDirector of Photography: Josh Herzog\n\nEditor: Michael Suyeda\n\nProducer: Chase Lewis\n\nProducer, On Set: Bety Dereje\n\nAssociate Producer: Lea Donenberg\n\nAssistant Camera: Paola Oliveros\n\nGaffer: Eli Kravetz\n\nKey Grip: Christopher Mitchell\n\nAudio: Mariya Chulichkova\n\nFood Stylist: Jeannie Chen\n\nProduction Assistant: Maya Layne\n\nSet Designer: Elaine Winter\n\nSet Design Assistant: Jacob Kander\n\nStylist: Ryan Young\n\nProduction Coordinators: Ava Kashar, Tania Jones\n\nProduction Manager: David Alvarez Paz\n\nLine Producer: Natasha Soto-Albors\n\nSenior Director, Production Management: Jessica Schier\n\nAssistant Editor: Fynn Lithgow\n\nPost Production Coordinator: Holly Frew\n\nSupervising Editor: Erica DeLeo\n\nPost Production Supervisor: Alexa Deutsch\n\nDirector, Post Production: Nicholas Ascanio\n\nAssociate Talent Manager: Phoebe Dishner\n\nDirector, Content Production: Rahel Gebreyes\n\nSenior Director, Digital Video: Romy van den Broeke\n\nSenior Director, Programming: Linda Gittleson\n\nVP, Video Programming: Thespena Guatieri",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "It was the push alert that sent shockwaves through my group chats: Last Thursday, President Trump threatened a 200% tariff on European wines and spirits as the latest retaliatory measure in his administration’s ever-escalating trade war.\n\nShould the tax be put into place (which could happen as soon as this spring), the cost of whiling away an afternoon with a bottle of Provence Rosé could become a much more expensive proposition—to say nothing of devastating an already troubled industry. (Between the rise of non-alcoholic drinks and pre-mixed cocktails, last year saw an overall downturn in more traditional wine and spirits sales.)\n\nYet the news has put a spotlight on American wines, a category long misunderstood by funk-forward natural-wine drinkers like me.\n\n“The quality in US wine, especially if you know where to look, is definitely no different than in Europe,” says Jeff DiLorenzo, who leads domestic buying at New York City’s Chambers Street Wines. “Most people have preconceived notions of their preferences, but it does feel like there are more and more outstanding producers in the US that people don’t really give a chance.”\n\nAs he tells me, however, it helps to approach an American wine not as a direct corollary to well-known European varieties, but rather as its own thing. “It’s like two different cheeses from two different areas,” DiLorenzo says. “There are nuances that are going to make it distinct—but I think the quality is on par, so you can find something that’s equally enjoyable.”\n\nIn that spirit, below, DiLorenzo breaks down American wines worth knowing—politics and tariffs aside.\n\nIf you’re looking for white wine…\n\n“If you typically go for Sancerre, there are some great Sauvignon Blancs coming from California—I really like the Bedrock Sauvignon Blanc from Sonoma County, which has the flinty, sleek mineral side you often find with Sancerre. It’s elegant, crisp, dry, and generally runs around $30 retail in New York, which is about what you’d pay for an average Sancerre.\n\nAnother store favorite is the Elizabeth Spencer North Coast Sauvignon Blanc from Mendocino, which is a great value at around $20 and has a bit more citrus fruit, but is still crisp, dry, and refreshing.\n\nChenin blanc is one of my favorite grapes, especially coming from the Loire Valley and particularly from Anjou. I’m pretty discerning when it comes to Chenin, but I’ve found the Haarmeyer St. Rey En Foudre Chenin Blanc from Clarksburg, California, to be one of my favorite wines from anywhere. It’s chiseled and structured, has that waxy texture, honeyed aroma, and laser-beam acidity that I love in Chenin. Also, when you can find it, the Sandlands Chenin is worth seeking out.”\n\nIf you’re looking for rosé…\n\n“For a light, pale, and dry Provence rosé, there are a good number of options, but I especially love the Matthiasson Rosé from Napa, which year after year hits all the right notes: nice balanced fruit, great acidity, incredibly fresh, and oh-so-easy to drink. I actually prefer it to most Provence rosés.”\n\nIf you’re looking for red wine…\n\n“Many people have drawn comparisons between Burgundy in France and Oregon’s Willamette Valley, as they lie along the same latitude and have similarities in climate. Burgundy is known for Pinot noir and Chardonnay, and there is no shortage of great Willamette Valley Pinot noirs and Chardonnays available. One of my personal favorites is the Fossil & Fawn Pinot Noir, which is a phenomenal value and is medium-light in body, with that forest-floor earthiness you get from some great Burgundy Pinots. Other Oregon producers of note are Cameron, Kelley Fox, and the Eyrie Vineyards, all making incredible wines that I believe are on par with any high-end Burgundy.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Of course, there’s definitely an argument to be made for leaving well enough alone, especially as it pertains to near-perfect rom-coms, and no mere mortal could reasonably expect to pen a worthy successor to Nora Ephron ’s original script. That said, is it crazy that I’d accept even a B-minus interpretation of Harry and Sally’s love story just to spend some time with those beloved characters again? I’d also love to catch up with Jess and Marie, Harry and Sally’s somewhat-smug couple friends; I’m no casting director, but I think placing Billie Lourd in her late mom Carrie Fisher’s role as the sardonic yet lovable Marie would bring a tear to pretty much everyone’s eye. (We miss you, Carrie!)\n\nIt’s entirely possible that if the industry powers that be had already elected to bring When Harry Met Sally back to the big screen (or—God help us—the small screen, as some sort of limited series on a streaming network), I would be turning up my nose at it and writing an outraged screed about how Hollywood was insulting the memory of one of the greatest sweater movies of all time. If the reboot were done correctly, though, I think it could be genuinely wonderful to spend time with two of the most pivotal sweeties in romantic-comedy history. (Maybe someone like Michaela Coel could get this right?)\n\nSeriously, why isn’t Hollywood getting on this? Commission a script! Go out to some big names! Do I have to do everything?",

Each and every state is distinct—which, when you think about it, translates to a lifetime of exploration for anyone up to the challenge of diving deeper. You see it in the ancient petroglyphs tucked away in the landscapes of Arizona. You see it in the crawfish cuisine in deep Louisiana. You see it in the soaring skyscrapers in Manhattan. There is—truly—a tremendous amount of diversity here.\n\nSimply put, you can’t easily categorize the best places to visit in the USA. For every rugged wilderness there’s a metropolitan epicenter, a beachside retreat for every desert dwelling. Likewise, no matter how niche or finicky of a traveler one might be, there’s a destination to suit every sort of personality.

The route, which connects Santa Fe to Taos, runs 56 miles along a winding road through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and is bookended by two striking churches: San Francisco de Asis Church and Santuario de Chimayo. The Southwest is best explored by car, making frequent stops at remote villages to appreciate Spanish colonial churches and indigenous Pueblo architecture.\n\nStay Here: Bishop's Lodge, Auberge Resorts Collection sits just a few miles outside of downtown Santa Fe in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo range and was once the private home of the first Archbishop of Santa Fe. Now, the luxury lodge (surrounded by 317 acres of forest) is a luxury retreat complete with all the details that make New Mexico distinct, from kiva fireplaces in the guest rooms to the SkyFire restaurant with its wood-fired cooking.\n\nWine in the Willamette Valley",

[laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue.

        "content": "At a private baccarat table near the back of the El Cortez Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on a chilly January afternoon, a crowd of fans gathered to watch one of the world’s most famous gamblers at work. Some had come all the way here just to watch him play. They savored every detail—how he cut chips, ruffled his cash, bantered with the dealer. He was dressed for the job. His gray hair was molded into a tight crew cut, and he wore a knitted gold necklace low across his collarbone and a Super Bowl–sized ring with a Ruby 777 jackpot dangling from his hand.\n\nThe scene was impressive, except in one way: This man absolutely sucked at gambling. I’d been with Vegas Matt—the YouTube tycoon whose millions of followers salivate over his every bet—for only a few hours. He’d already lost close to $30,000. His four-figure slot machine deposits had gone bust, an unyielding blackjack jet had hoovered up his teetering stacks of chips, and his rare victories had been reinvested into more audacious, ill-fated propositions. There was no way he’d end the night with dignity, yet here he was, perched at the baccarat table, trying to get even.\n\nUsually, the dealer wordlessly organized Matt’s money into thick columns of $100 bills, pleating their edges at a slight diagonal so she could slash through them all at once with counterfeit-detecting iodine ink. But Vegas Matt was making this bet with a ticket he had just extracted from a slot machine. It was worth $6,627. Baccarat is as close as a gambler can get to flipping a coin: Two pairs of cards are dealt, players add up the numbers printed on them, and the combination that comes closest to nine is declared the winner. The dealer revealed an eight. Vegas Matt turned over a zero.\n\n“Oh my God!” he cried, slinging the cards across the felt while his 30-year-old son, EJ, filmed the disaster on his iPhone. “We cannot win a hand!”\n\nThat, of course, is his schtick. Vegas Matt’s legion of fans follow him for exactly one reason, and that’s to watch him lose—and, on seldom occasions, win—unconscionable amounts of money. That $30,000 wasn’t even close to the worst drubbing he’s taken: In 2023 he and a few friends lost $147,000 on a high-stakes slot machine in about three hours. (The description on the video read, “Nobody should gamble like this, my friends got a little carried away.”) A year later, he managed to blow through about $43,000 in a single afternoon. All told, in 2024 he reportedly suffered $404,000 in gambling losses. Yet, somehow, he has managed to turn losing money into an enviable living—and is one of the only people on Earth to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People give estimates of what they think we’re making, and it’s always way low,” he told me from the plush interior of his Rolls-Royce, which was still scented with a synthetic new-purchase aroma. “Our watch hours on YouTube [in December] were, like, 5.7 million hours. And there’s a commercial every 10 minutes.”\n\nVegas Matt was on the cusp of a remarkable achievement. In a matter of weeks, his YouTube channel would cross the million-subscriber mark—a metric that pairs nicely with the million or so people who follow his Instagram account, and the 685,000 on his TikTok. New videos appear daily, and they all follow the same format: First, Vegas Matt counts out a hefty wager in front of a blackjack table or a slot machine. Then, like so many gamblers, he simply tries his luck. The camera is framed to provide the illusion that the viewer is in the captain’s chair, preparing to immolate $3,000 on the altar of chance. Throughout all this, Vegas Matt displays no elite strategy, acumen, or gamesmanship. He does not claim to have an insider’s edge or an esoteric jackpot-juicing technique. No one watching his videos is going to pick up tips to improve their approach. But that’s the magic: He’s utterly relatable. One of the enduring axioms of the gambling world is that despite anyone’s best efforts, the house always wins. So, in the language of casinos, to be relatable is to eat shit, constantly, and nevertheless crawl back for more. For amateur gamblers like me, these videos are the closest we can get to the intoxicating precarity of a big bet without risking a dent to the checking account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the fantasy that Vegas Matt is selling: an everlasting bro paradise, sweatless and free, where the bankroll never runs dry and the weekend stretches out into eternity. “It’s like watching a reality show,” he said of his channel’s appeal. “What would happen if you were in Vegas, every day, and gambled? Because that’s what we do every day.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not the only person in my circle to be seduced by this. Mixed in among his army of followers are an old college buddy, a member of my boys-only group chat, and a fellow thirtysomething colleague who was absolutely enthralled after he learned that I was profiling Vegas Matt. (“I love his videos when he’s losing at blackjack,” he said. “Man, awesome.”) When Vegas Matt posted an Instagram clip from the El Cortez in which I could briefly be seen in the background, my brother-in-law instantly shot me a text.\n\n“You doing a piece on Matt?” he wrote. “I’ve got a lot of questions about that guy.”\n\nI did as well. While I’ve thought of him mostly as a gambling cryptid—Bigfoot if he were in way too deep at the roulette wheel—I was also mystified by his persona. His fans are too. Who even is this guy? Where did he come from? How can he stand to lose so much money? But most of all, I wanted to know if his life was as enticing as it looked on camera. When it comes to that, in Vegas, I learned to be careful what I wish for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was always possible to become a celebrity by gambling, but, historically speaking, the luminaries of this world were expected to win. This was especially true in the early 2000s, during the so-called poker boom. Around that time, a renewed interest in the game minted a fresh generation of stars, like Daniel Negreanu, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Ivey, who had clairvoyant talents on the felt. Negreanu in particular was known for his uniquely telegenic flair—he often announced the exact makeup of the face-down cards in front of the other players, thrilling audiences, bamboozling rivals, and propelling him to $55 million in career live earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poker boom came to an end in 2011, when the Justice Department seized the domains of online gambling sites. (The poker community refers to the day of the raid as “Black Friday.”) In one fell swoop, gambling was dramatically curtailed in America. But seven years later, in 2018, the industry made an unexpected comeback when the Supreme Court overturned the long-standing Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and liberalized lawful online sports betting in the United States. The practice—once cordoned off to the scant few alcoves on the map where gambling was already legal—is now established in 39 states and counting. Our citizens are hooked: Americans are estimated to have wagered $150 billion on sports in 2024, a seismic increase from the $7 billion risked during the first year of legalization. Real estate moguls, too, are breaking ground on casinos in formerly verboten territories. Officials in New York City are currently mulling 11 proposals from betting companies, including Caesars Palace, which is eyeing an eight-story game room in the heart of Times Square.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, I have watched this disruptive gambling renaissance meld with my social rhythms in real time, as more and more friends embrace the titillation of risk. The Negreanu facade has crumbled. The face of the hobby is no longer a gang of sharks outfoxing one another around the poker table. Now it’s idiots like me, whipping out their phone on a Thursday night, destined to endanger another $20 on a doomed three-leg parlay. My Instagram algorithm is littered, alongside Vegas Matt, with deep-fried, postironic gambling memes, all of which seem to simultaneously celebrate and parody the impotence of this enterprise. One of my favorites features a dejected man with a pickax, millimeters from breaking into a hoard of diamonds. The caption reads: “99% of gambling addicts quit right before their big win … never give up.” Perhaps it makes sense, then, that Vegas Matt has become our avatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many fools my age, I first discovered Vegas Matt—real name: Matt Morrow—when he appeared on my Instagram during a listless weekday morning while I was trying to stave off a variety of financial anxieties: credit card debt, wedding deposits, a lease-renewal negotiation that was sure to get ugly. Those obligations were briefly alleviated when Matt, looking ridiculously tan, with a wide-eyed, overcaffeinated stare, appeared on my phone and, in about 15 seconds, lost more than what I make in a month. (It was on yet another hand of baccarat.) I was entranced: With the flick of my thumb, I saw him replicate the routine again and again, across hundreds of videos, sloughing off whole down payments—whole net worths—into the maw of the casino. It was obscene, and also, perversely enviable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVegas Matt’s professional gambling career, if you can call it that, began in 2021, when he was 58 and working in real estate. One night, at a video poker table, he needed a miracle to rebound from a $9,000 deficit. He was dealt the ace and queen of hearts and went looking for the other pieces to complete a royal flush. The machine took mercy on him with a jack, king, and 10—all hearts. Morrow was ecstatic. He whipped out his phone and filmed the $12,060 jackpot, beaming with pride. When his son EJ reviewed the clip later that evening, he wondered if it could go viral. They came up with the name Vegas Matt and posted the video to TikTok, where it garnered a modest but promising 40,000 views. The following day, EJ and Matt returned to the scene of the crime to try and film a second royal flush. This time, they bricked out with an ace high. “Absolute shit sandwich,” said Matt in that clip, examining the wreckage of his wager. Tellingly, the video did better, notching 112,000 views. (One of the video’s first comments reads, “You are going to be broke.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrow kept at it. He uploaded video after video of his trips to the casino, fleshing out the character his fans know today. The Vegas Matt persona is a stubborn gambler who cherishes his wins and mourns his losses without ever growing outright despondent. He avoids the tactics of other gambling influencers, who seem to mostly post their massive jackpots. And despite his loss-heavy record, you never quite feel as if you’re watching an addict burn it all down, because it’s clear this enterprise is at least somewhat moneymaking. Morrow didn’t tell me exactly how much money he’s generating from his social media enterprise, but EJ has suggested that 70 percent of their net revenue comes from YouTube advertisements, while the other 30 percent is divided between sponsorships and Vegas Matt’s own merchandise store. (He sells, among other things, a $55 pink hoodie featuring one cursive word: Gamble.)\n\nSo the digital engagement has allowed him to scrub away the incredible risk of a night at the casino, but fundamentally, Vegas Matt can keep the engine churning only if he is making bets. And sometimes the losses do get to him. Morrow told me that he finished 2024 on a nasty losing streak that forced him to take some money that wasn’t reserved for gambling out of his bank account so he could keep making videos. “I was like, I’m sick of this,” he said; he briefly considered paring down his filming schedule from seven to five days a week to stay solvent. But for as much as Vegas Matt does take a beating, he is always safeguarded by a tide of YouTube residuals, which is not something I can assert for anyone else in the process of losing $30,000 at the El Cortez. The man is unshackled by the burden of temperance. He has jury-rigged his arcane revenue streams in such a way that he can continue to do something he truly loves, at an incredible velocity, without ever being humbled. It all makes Morrow vaguely intangible: an immaterial man in a very material world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re not among his intended audience, just know that Vegas Matt is famous—much more famous than even I knew. He is famous enough to provoke titters of glee and bewildered, saucer-eyed stares in town. Walk alongside him, and aloof Las Vegas cracks open, revealing a warm and accommodating interior. He can go anywhere, and do anything, with intoxicating panache. No matter where we go, Morrow is recognized by valets, dealers, pit bosses, and, of course, the thousands of tourists ambling around southern Nevada.\n\nIn the palatial Crockfords casino, a pair of Argentinians gesture toward him, pushing against the limits of language to muster a halting “I watch your videos.” A roving band of bros beckon him to their table, hoping for a selfie and a single hand of blackjack. An eager clerk, working the front desk, asks for advice about increasing viewership on his own F1-themed YouTube channel, before passing along a key card to a 63rd-floor suite. But by far, the place Vegas Matt is most famous is the El Cortez, where he films the bulk of his videos and, therefore, where people know they have the best chance of running into him. On the day of my visit, Morrow entered the game room with a Starbucks coffee in hand. Seconds later, he was swarmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I knew we were going to get lucky!” shouted a fan who had joined this impromptu meet and greet. Vegas Matt is generous, flashing a big smile for everyone in line—after all, it’s really his fans who pay his bills. They all get a sticker as a souvenir. One sticker takes the shape of a blackjack table. Around its perimeter are the words Get Even, or Get Even Worse.\n\nMany of these people came here just to watch Vegas Matt make some bets. For the next four hours, they tail him back and forth across the corridors of the El Cortez, forming jittery semicircles around his seat in the same way one might jostle for a glimpse of Tiger Woods teeing off at Augusta. They wince at his defeats and toast his victories, and all are fluent in the jargon Morrow deploys on his YouTube channel. (Innage refers to how much money one has inserted into a slot machine. Sando is slang for a wager that bricks out in spectacular fashion.) Joe Schachinger and Kathy Wiese, a couple on vacation from Wisconsin, told me that Vegas Matt’s videos have become their go-to after-dinner entertainment, supplanting Jeopardy!, Netflix, and the evening news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’ll sit there and watch him for an hour,” said Schachinger, who owns an IT company and plays slots at $30 a spin.\n\n“If he wins, we’ll go to the casino,” Wiese said.\n\n“We live and die with him.”\n\nLurking nearby was Adam Wiesberg, the general manager of the El Cortez, who never lets Vegas Matt out of his sight. He is tasked with giving Morrow and his friends the high-roller treatment. Wiesberg will adjust the music to Vegas Matt’s liking, enforce a tight perimeter around the camera, and, after Morrow has finished his long shift of losing bets, escort him and his posse toward a plush leather booth at the rear of the casino’s marquee restaurant for a complimentary dinner of New York strips and stone crab claws. The one thing Wiesberg doesn’t do, he promised me, is stake Vegas Matt with free chips. Any money the man bleeds comes from his own bank account.\n\nVegas Matt films at the El Cortez because, since 2017, it’s been one of the few casinos in the city that allow patrons to shoot video of their table games. That was a bold decision, especially in such an infamously paranoid business. If players could record the intricacies of casino procedure, would they then be able to scratch out an advantage? Would the house begin to lose? So, early on in the experiment, Wiesberg’s peers in the industry thought he was out of his mind. “We did the first blackjack stream, and my phone was blowing up,” he said. “People were calling me, saying, ‘Hey, there’s someone recording your table!’ ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Wiesberg is a believer in the power of social media, and more than that, he thinks this association with Vegas Matt has clearly paid off. Looking around, I could understand why. The El Cortez was packed on this languid Friday afternoon, and there was no question that Vegas Matt was the main attraction. Wiesberg has leaned into the partnership to the point that the casino’s gift shop is brimming with Vegas Matt–branded shirts and sweaters. “People come in here to buy my merchandise, and then they lose $5,000,” quipped Morrow, unshy about the revenue he generates for the game room.\n\nMorrow would like to replicate this business model across Las Vegas. He hopes that one of those gleaming casinos on the Strip—away from the low-slung ceilings of the El Cortez—will offer him an exclusive deal. He would gamble there, and in return, he’d swarm the floor with a convoy of his fans.\n\n“I could have this place as busy as the El Cortez, but the geniuses who run these companies don’t get it yet,” Morrow said, from the middle of the alabaster Crockfords game room. “This place will pay Carrie Underwood $2 million a weekend to get 2,300 people into that theater. If I did a meet and greet and they promoted it, I could get 2,300 people there, but instead of a bunch of screaming girls, they’d be gamblers. They should be paying me $2 million.”\n\nIt’s hard to say he’s wrong. Vegas Matt has correctly identified a sea change in the gambling industry. The hobby’s inherent vice has become a feature rather than a bug. It’s never been easier to lose a bet in the United States, and with that, the glittery lures casinos used to rely on to get people inside the building—the Carrie Underwood concerts Morrow is referencing, spectacles that have historically been positioned to conceal the sin of Sin City—aren’t as necessary as they once were. That was another hurdle Wiesberg needed to navigate: Was he OK with someone showcasing the brutality of the El Cortez’s baccarat tables? He told me that other properties around Las Vegas, ones that have historically obfuscated the misery of this business, are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They’ve been projecting an image to the world forever of excitement and celebration,” he said. “And then he loses, like, $15,000 and walks out.”\n\nWiesberg has put faith in the idea that people like me have become immune to the traditional ways the gambling industry has marketed itself. Gone are the phony assurances of million-dollar payouts. No, maybe the only way I want to gamble—hell, the only way I know how to gamble—is just like Vegas Matt.\n\nHalfway through my day with Morrow, it became clear that he intended to impress me. He unveiled, one by one, all the blessings that were available to him after conquering Las Vegas—as if to emphasize, in no uncertain terms, that none of this was an act. Yes, Vegas Matt really does live like this, and the rest of us are right to be envious. In practice, that meant that I too was wreathed with VIP treatment for as long as I stood beside him. The reason I was in that Rolls-Royce in the first place was so Vegas Matt could show me that 63rd-floor suite near the vertigo-inducing apex of the Crockfords resort. We zoomed into the sky on the express elevator and gazed through floor-to-ceiling windows at the shimmering rooftops of hotels far less regal than ours.\n\nAnd yet, after several hours together, I’m still unable to pierce Vegas Matt’s gaudy persona. None of my questions connect: Morrow isn’t much of a sports fan, even though he wagered $12,500 on the Chiefs to win Super Bowl 59 (another loss). We don’t talk much about music, television, or politics, and the only pop-culture artifact he mentions to me throughout the day is the film Coming to America, which he describes as the “best movie ever.” In fact, the only time Vegas Matt truly opens up to me is when we talk about wealth—the way he pursued it and the luxurious perks it entails.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrow was raised in the Bay Area and has had a few past lives: He quit a college internship in Hawaii to spend his days at the beach while driving a pedicab. He lived in Los Angeles, where he unsuccessfully tried his hand at stand-up comedy and ended up helping finance a couple of kitschy horror movies in the late 1980s, including the infamous Night of the Demons.\n\nMorrow eventually found his calling in multilevel marketing (or, as he calls it, “network marketing”). He claims to have earned “millions” this way, a feat that would make him the exception to the 99 percent who fail to break even after getting wrapped up in the industry. He got his start in 1989 with a company called FundAmerica, which offered members rebates on airline tickets and long-distance telephone calls. (Its founder was arrested in 1990, and FundAmerica filed for bankruptcy months later.) Morrow told me he then became a top earner at Vemma, a dietary supplement company that was shut down in 2015 following a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission. (The agency alleged that, among other things, Vemma systematically preyed upon college students.)\n\nBefore I could even mount a follow-up question to Morrow about this, he instinctively launched into his defense. It’s as simple as this: MLMs get a bad rap because the wrong people are involved in them. His good name has been tarnished by too many creeps and weirdos. Their failures aren’t just that they can’t motivate others to sign up to sell weight-loss products, Morrow said. The problem is much bigger than that—they don’t have any friends in the first place.\n\n“So many people fail, and they don’t want to take responsibility for their failure. They blame the industry. They say, ‘Oh it’s a scam,’ ” he said. For the first time in our entire day together, there is a flash of venom. “But the reality is, nobody likes you, and you failed because you couldn’t get anyone to join.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo become a gambling influencer, one must already be pretty rich, and that tracks with the single ambition Vegas Matt seems to have. Over and over again, he told me that the only thing he’s ever wanted to do with his life is have fun. So it was a little surprising that he’d adopted such a defensive posture about the method he used to get here. Scroll through the recesses of YouTube, and you’ll see Morrow offering the exact same apologia for the tough-minded virtues of multilevel marketing to the very people he was trying to recruit: In one memorable clip, Vegas Matt lounges in a colossal living room and makes the case that anyone can live like this, so long as they aren’t a loser. “We’re looking for cool people,” he said, advocating for Vemma. “If you’re some unemployed, broke, annoying person, no one is going to listen to you.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment that clarifies the twinge of humiliation I felt after watching him cut out a baccarat bet of roughly the same value as my 401(k). Am I a loser? Are you? Are we, the unwashed masses, simply unlikable—and is that where it all went wrong? Clearly, Vegas Matt is a master at stoking a poisonous sense of inadequacy.\n\nThat’s when one of the great ironies of Morrow’s existence comes into focus. I was attracted to his videos for their effervescent bachelor-party texture, a vision of a life unencumbered by anything but gratification. But the more I was around Morrow, the more I detected an elemental craving just below those gold chains. Toward the end of our time, Morrow told me about the future he envisions for the Vegas Matt brand: He’d like to be flown from casino to casino in a private jet so he may make bets in their businesses as a featured VIP. The fantasy is so ridiculous I can hardly wrap my mind around it: Imagine exploring the country exclusively through the prism of smoke-filled game rooms. The world has rewarded Vegas Matt with incredible spoils, but like so many hustlers before him, he can’t quite stop himself from wanting more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suppose that is one of the few things Vegas Matt and I have in common. Because I too have sat at a blackjack table deep into the witching hour, and even on my best nights, I don’t think I’ve ever wandered to the payout window feeling totally satiated. Yes, Vegas Matt has managed to nullify the perils of gambling, but he has done so by leveraging social media—yet another casino, replete with long odds and enthralling opportunity—where the numbers can always get bigger. The horrible truth is that the iridescent desert sun can be refracting through the tinted windows of your blacked-out Rolls-Royce, and still the only thing on your mind is the next bet.\n\nAnd why is the grind worth it? Easy. It has made Vegas Matt a celebrity, which, as I learned, is much more of a thrill for him than the money is. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Morrow told me he was bullied as a kid and felt like an outcast growing up. “Even at 61 years old, it’s a rewarding experience when people from your past, going back decades, reach out. Everyone wants a piece of you,” he said. “This is cliché, but for someone who had a hard time getting a date to the prom, or who wasn’t picked to be on the basketball team at recess, it’s fun to be like, Hey, maybe I am doing all right.”\n\nHowie Mandel was due onstage in five minutes, but before that, he wanted to take a photo with Vegas Matt. The pair initially connected last summer, when Mandel hosted him on his podcast and probed Morrow about his financial solvency. (“Are you up or down?” asked an inquisitive Mandel at the beginning of the episode.) Morrow, along with the rest of his group, is a special guest of Mandel tonight. We’ve been escorted behind the curtains of the David Copperfield Theater—located in the bowels of the MGM—for a quick flutter of Instagrams. Afterward, Mandel outlines the plan ahead.\n\n“Let’s shoot some content tomorrow,” he said to Morrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments later, we were sitting in a swank booth in the second row of the auditorium while a trickle of gray-haired snowbirds fill in the cheap seats. I was reminded again of just how easy life in Las Vegas appears to be for Morrow, how this citadel of scams seems to loosen at his touch. I remembered that in a matter of hours, I would no longer be in his orbit. The old world was calling, the one I shared with the other 40 million tourists who come to Las Vegas every year, composed of $10 baccarat bets and gouging ATM premiums.\n\nWe said our goodbyes after the show, and Vegas Matt left me standing in the wide-open chambers of the MGM Grand. My eight hours as a high roller were officially over. Now it was time to become reacquainted with the city as I’ve always understood it.\n\nThe next day, after a couple of way-too-strong gin and sodas, I withdrew the $100 I had, at the beginning of the trip, made peace with losing. The blackjack table treated me well. I was actually on a bit of a hot streak by the time I hit the poker table, where a quintet of players much richer than I bled me dry in record time. Afterward, I found myself in a very familiar place: bereft and alone in a buzzing casino, more drunk than I had planned on being, talking myself out of the wish to get even, or get even worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI held firm and rode the elevator back to my room. I drifted off to sleep while taking solace in the idea that for as glitzy as the Vegas Matt reverie might be, my mundane reality had its own virtue. The thrill of risking money that I can never recover, with YouTube metrics or otherwise, is one of my most cherished sins. And when I do lose, there isn’t a private dinner of stone crab claws waiting to balm my sorrows. I might be playing at much smaller stakes—I’ve never come close to losing $30,000 in a day—but of the two of us, it’s me who really has something to lose. Vegas Matt will never understand the rawness of my vice.\n\nIn turn, maybe I will never understand the drudgery of his craft. A great Vegas trip, for my money, consists of a sudden and violent psychological displacement. All of my frugalities are thrown out the window, bad ideas become good ideas, until, before long, I’m buying a pack of Marlboro Reds at 4 in the morning. Those doses of depravity—meted out in 36-hour intervals—are the spice of life. Vegas Matt, on the other hand, is unable to take a break from reality with the intoxicating assistance of excess. He has mixed business with pleasure, and naturally, business is winning out. There are plenty of things I will always envy about Morrow, but I’m glad that the sacred, brain-healing ritual of a Saturday night at the casino with the boys will never become routine, or even boring. I don’t think I would have understood this if I hadn’t come to see him.\n\nTwo weeks after I left Las Vegas, Vegas Matt crossed the million-subscriber threshold. He celebrated the only way he knows how: risking a million bucks in a single day, and broadcasting the carnage on YouTube. Morrow supplied half of the sum himself with a gratuitous pile of cash secured with rubber bands. The other half was cheerfully loaned out by the casino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was business as usual for Vegas Matt. A blackjack dealer ripped away his $10,000 wagers, piece by piece. A slot machine repossesses a $20,000 investment in record time. But near the conclusion of the video, Morrow made the single biggest bet he’s ever recorded on camera: $100,000, on one hand of baccarat. This time, though, Vegas Matt was the one to turn over an eight.\n\n“I think I’m going to pass out!” he shouted, dizzy with glee. “Thank you, dealer!”\n\nAll told, Morrow logged a small victory. He was up about $76,000. It could have gone so much worse. At the end of the night, Morrow decompressed in the casino lounge, toasting both his winnings and the viewers who’ve come along for the ride. He’d switched outfits. Morrow was wearing the newest item available in the Vegas Matt merch store. It’s a T-shirt emblazoned with a jackpot counter. The white-and-gold letters across his chest spell out four words: One in a Million.",

        "content": "This article contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of Severance, “Cold Harbor.”\n\nSeverance began as a show about office drones desperate to escape a psychic prison, but in its second season, the severed floor of Lumon Industries has started to feel more like a gilded cage. In response to the attempted jailbreak staged by the workers of Macrodata Refinement at the end of the first season, Lumon, a sprawling global conglomerate with nebulous but undoubtedly sinister aims, introduced a series of workplace reforms aimed at placating their restive employees. But they were mostly either cosmetic—upgraded vending-machine snacks!—or unenforceably vague, and the promises of a more open and human workplace quickly faded away once it became clear that Mark S. (Adam Scott) and his fellow rebels weren’t likely to be bought off with a few insubstantial gestures. The outdoor field trip presented as a team-building perk took place in a frozen, depopulated wasteland, and the long-awaited consummation of Mark’s romance with his fellow refiner Helly (Britt Lower) was marred by the discovery that he’d actually slept with her real-world outie, Helena Eagan, who’d been posing as her severed self in order to spy for the company. Irving B. (John Turturro), the Lumon old-timer whose outie retains enough subconscious knowledge of Lumon’s hidden depths for it to surface in his artwork, saw through Helena’s ruse, and Helly was returned to her rightful place, with no knowledge of what her body had been up to in her absence. But Helena’s night with Mark, the longest and most intimate interaction between an innie and outie in the show’s history, set off a string of philosophical questions. Are the innies truly distinct individuals from the outies? And if they are truly separate people, which ones are we meant to be pulling for?\n\nLong-running TV shows—and Severance has been on the air for three years, even if it’s only managed 19 episodes in that span—inevitably end up deepening their characters, discovering or inventing sides to them we’d never suspected were there. Often, though not always, that means making them more sympathetic. In the show’s second season, we learned that Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), the Lumon zealot who ran the severed floor like a petty tyrant, was once a child laborer in one of the company’s factories, and was exiled to middle management while the company’s CEO, Helena’s father, took credit for her invention of the severance procedure, which might be the company’s most valuable asset. Her replacement, Seth Milchick, was an officious terror in his own right, but in Season 2, the show has delved more explicitly into the tensions inherent in being an ambitious Black employee in a largely white company, navigating aggressions both micro- and macro- while keeping a corporate-approved grin on his face. New villains emerged to take their place as uncomplicated heavies, including the hulking corporate enforcer Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) and the sinister Dr. Mauer (Robby Benson).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Severance​ Nails One Particularly Fraught Aspect of the Workplace Read More\n\nThe core MDR quartet of Mark, Helly, Irving, and Dylan (Zach Cherry) have all grown more complicated, too, spurred by Helly’s resistance to the Lumon-dictated status quo. (For most of the first season, she has no idea her outie is the heir apparent to the entire company, but she seems have to retained a vestigial sense that she’s meant for better things.) With no sense of what the outside world was like—after Mark is briefly able to awaken his innie self while aboveground, his co-workers enviously ask him to describe the sky—the innies had nothing better to hope for. But like Eve in the garden, Helly opened up possibilities too tempting to be forgotten. What if the MDR crew, whose job consists of sorting clusters of numbers into boxes on a computer monitor, actually knew what they were doing, rather than just being assured their work is “mysterious and important”? What if they could go outside, live their lives, or even just consciously exist for more than the length of an eight-hour day? What if work wasn’t all there is?\n\nAre the innies truly distinct individuals from the outies, and if they are truly separate people, which ones are we meant to be pulling for?\n\nThe more we’ve seen of the outside world, though, the less it seems worth fighting to inhabit it. Mark’s outie is still deep in grieving the death of his wife, Dylan inhabits what seems to be a comfortable but essentially loveless marriage, and Irving lives alone in a dark apartment, possibly suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from a past military deployment. These are lives to escape from, not to. Helena Eagan may be part of the elite, but her life, which we finally got a glimpse of in the second season’s penultimate episode, looks like a high-end version of utter misery: swimming solitary laps and eating a desultory breakfast under the unnervingly watchful eye of her father, who looks and sounds like a lightly reanimated corpse. Even the people who don’t work at Lumon seem to live in an environment suffocated by its influence, a gray, endless winter devoid of joy or fulfillment. (On the Severance podcast, director Ben Stiller proudly noted that the scenes flashing back to Mark’s life with his wife, Gemma, are virtually the only time in the show’s history we’ve seen a tree with leaves on it.) It’s as if the outer world is also cut off from something vital. The severed floor might be, as Helly reminds us in the second-season finale, “hell,” but at least they’ve got snacks. There’s no place like work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to sustain an audience, a television show has to make its central location a pleasant place for its viewers, if not its characters, to spend time in. Lumon’s endless corridors convey a numbing repetition, but they’re a dazzling white, and the retro-modernist design of its office spaces is enthralling in its immaculate specificity. That goes for the characters as well. Because Mark is the show’s central figure, we spend roughly as much time with each of his selves—the second season’s first two episodes replay the same series of events from his outie’s and innie’s perspectives—but his co-workers’ outies are essentially strangers to us, no substitute for the innies we’ve come to know and love. When innies end their employment, either by choice or otherwise, they effectively die; it’s not clear whether their severed selves get permanently deleted or just lie dormant, like a file they’re not allowed to open. Leading into the second-season finale, the show toyed with the idea that both Irving’s and Dylan’s innies might be gone for good: The former, fired for attempting to drown the future head of the company, boards a train heading for points unknown, and the latter, who’s developed unrequited feelings for his outie’s wife, voluntarily resigns in an effort to end his own suffering. These ought, at least in theory, to be moments of triumph—free at last. But as TV viewers, we don’t want change, at least of the kind that deprives of us of more time with our favorite make-believe friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-season finale, “Cold Harbor,” brings this conflict to a head. Mark’s outie has been hatching a plan to rescue Gemma, who, instead of being dead, has been effectively held prisoner inside Lumon for the past few years. But to do it, he needs his innie’s help. Although Mark has been attempting an experimental reintegration process that would fuse his inner and outer selves, the procedure is still buggy and impermanent, so the only way for the two to communicate is by passing messages back and forth via video camera. Mark’s outie begs his innie to help with the rescue, warning him that completing the file he has been working on will result in her death. But Mark S. quickly realizes that the plan essentially involves killing himself. He’s in love, too, with Helly, but there’s no chance their outies would feel the same way. Mark’s outie tries to act like he sympathizes, but a crucial slip of the tongue—he calls the woman Mark S. loves “Heleny”—reveals how little he knows, and, truthfully, cares, about the inner life of his severed self. As far as Mark’s outie is concerned, his innie isn’t a real person, just a mistake he’s hoping to undo, and for Mark’s innie, that means there isn’t much difference between his original self and the company he works for—except that Lumon, at least for now, still wants him around. And so Mark’s innie makes a devastating but inevitable choice: He frees Gemma and then locks himself back inside, choosing a life of captivity with Helly over the freedom of oblivion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Severance podcast, listeners call in to a weekly advice line where they ask questions as if they’re Lumon employees, frequently signing off with an enthusiastic “Praise Kier.” It’s a little odd to hear them cosplaying as members of the Eagans’ corporate cult, but it also fits the culture that has grown up around the show, where fans and advertisers alike voluntarily insert themselves into its dystopian world. Stiller’s podcast ads pitch project-management software as a less cumbersome alternative to the severance procedure—despite the show’s entry-level POV, its marketing is aimed squarely at management—and Lumon even has its own LinkedIn page. Severance has come to function like a lavish science-fiction version of Dilbert, whose strips about the humiliations of corporate life were pinned inside every cubicle in every office I worked in as an office temp, skewering the mind-numbing repetition and alienation of the characters’ jobs while forging a kind of fatalistic camaraderie: Sure, this is terrible, but at least we’re in it together. Life on the severed floor is degrading and inhumane, but when all your friends are there, it’s better than no life at all.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Halfway through the newly released 12th episode of The Pitt, Max’s hit medical drama set in a hospital emergency department, the injured ex-husband of Dr. Cassie McKay (Fiona Dourif) hobbles on crutches into the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital emergency room, before stopping in his tracks, the color draining from his face. Having been injured in a skateboarding accident, Chad (Rob Heaps) has found his way from an upstairs room back to the ER in order to search for his young son, who is waiting in a break room for his mom to finish her shift. But the scene Chad encounters is one of chaos and carnage: Dozens of gunshot victims—some conscious, most not—occupy seemingly every available bed and chair; doctors and nurses rush from patient to patient, wearing disposable white medical gowns that are now splattered a deep red; cleaning teams race to mop up pools of blood scattered across the floor before new ones inevitably form. There has been a mass shooting at a music festival; this is the immediate, horrific aftermath.\n\nAs I saw the shell-shocked Chad bear witness to these graphic scenes of death and gore, I felt an instant sense of kinship. His reaction mirrored my own as I watched what instantly felt like one of the most remarkable and important episodes of television I’d seen in years—perhaps ever. As mass shootings have slowly become part of the grim background of American life—with a media that is unwilling or unable to show the public the true horrors of, say, what a semiautomatic weapon can do to a person’s body—this episode of The Pitt, dramatized fiction as it may be, is urgent, necessary viewing, something everyone in the country needs to take in.\n\nFrom the beginning of the season, it has felt as if The Pitt was building to this storyline, albeit somewhat clunkily. Throughout their 15-hour shift, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) and Dr. McKay have been sparring over what to do about David Saunders (Jackson Kelly), the clearly troubled teenager whose mother, Theresa (Joanna Going), has been brought to the ER under the guise of needing treatment. Instead, Theresa confesses that she faked her illness after discovering a notebook belonging to her son in which he’d written down the names of girls at his school that he wanted to “eliminate.” After David flees the hospital, while his mother remains for several episodes of tortured debate about whether to involve police, it felt obvious that it was only a matter of time before something gun-related happened in the show, even if it wasn’t yet clear whether David was the music-festival mass shooter. What felt even more predictable was that Jake (Taj Speights), Dr. Robby’s former stepson, would somehow end up caught in the crossfire; the lovestruck teen’s narrative arc about taking his new girlfriend to the festival felt like prime material that the writers couldn’t resist turning into tragedy drawn from real events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Everyone’s New Favorite Medical Drama Is Not Like ER in One Important Way Read More\n\nGiven all this heavy foreshadowing, I had honestly been dreading this pivot. It felt inevitable for the show to build toward some sort of major disaster as the season nears its end. But part of the appeal of The Pitt has been the way in which it eschews traditional TV tropes. There are no real workplace romances to speak of, as in Grey’s Anatomy, and there’s no overbearing musical score used to heighten tension, as in ER. Instead, because of its unique structure (every episode is one hour of the emergency shift), The Pitt feels something like medical drama cinéma vérité. Indeed, the show has found fans in real-world medical workers who have praised its authenticity. Wouldn’t such a plotline seem like, well, just too TV? Thanks to deft treatment and trademark Pitt realism, however, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nSome of the episode’s most tense moments fall right at the start, before any gunshot victims arrive, as the Pitt staff, after learning of the news, kicks into “Code Triage” mode and begins to silently contemplate just what might be coming. As the nearest hospital to the festival, Pitt’s ER is likely to get the majority of the victims. “Expect the worst,” Dr. Robby tells his team. In these tense moments of eerie calm before the storm, we see hospital protocols swing into action: Drums of extra supplies are wheeled in, extra operating rooms are prepared, patients in the waiting room are told to leave for urgent care centers, and ER staff phone loved ones, not knowing when they might be able to return home. This will be “no-frills combat-zone medicine,” Dr. Jack Abbot (Shawn Hatosy) instructs the staff: no X-rays, no CT scans, no ultrasounds, no lab tests. They will need to think fast and on the fly. The new 10-second triage system will involve giving patients color-coded wristbands that denote whether they will die within five minutes or an hour—or whether they’re already dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe muscle memory by which the hospital now appears to be running is no fluke but the result of training, preparation, and experience drawn from reality. When two teen gunmen opened fire at a charter school in Colorado in 2019, members of the local hospital staff there found themselves treating young victims of a school shooting for the third time in their careers. In 2018 doctors in Tennessee treated victims of three separate mass shootings in just seven months. As mass shootings become more common, medical workers’ responses become almost second nature—although no less depressing and traumatic.\n\nAs the sound of the sirens draws closer, the inevitable crush finally arrives, and with it an onslaught rarely if ever depicted on television in such graphic detail. The first dead person turns up within seconds. Other victims have deep wounds from bullets that have blown chunks through their abdomens. In one case, a person’s intestines hang out. Amid the naked, bloody bodies, we see the staff thrusting tubes into the head of a penis and quite literally drilling intravenous holes into people’s arms, all in the name of efficiency and expediency. Still, the number of dead piles up. Until this point in the season, episodes of The Pitt have ebbed and flowed between fast-paced moments of intense treatments, as patients suddenly flatline, and quieter moments of reflection, even levity, as the staffers form bonds with patients and each other. Now, however, there is no relenting from the pandemonium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid the mayhem, two haunting images stood out for me. In the first, we see bloody handprints lining the side of an arriving ambulance; they’re the marks of desperate people who had been clawing at the already full emergency vehicle, we’re told. In the second, we observe a woman sitting in a wheelchair, a gunshot wound in her arm. Clearly in a state of severe shock that has left her unable to speak, all she can do is silently cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s no secret that U.S. gun violence is a humanmade epidemic without parallel in the world. The American Public Health Association has declared it a public health crisis and a leading cause of premature death. Guns are also the leading cause of death for American children and teenagers. In 2023 nearly 47,000 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S., according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the third-highest number in recorded history, bested only by the two preceding years.\n\nRelated From Slate Netflix’s New No. 1 Hit Is One of the Best Shows of the Year Read More\n\nBut these statistics, familiar as they are, can no longer fully convey the scale of horror that befalls gunshot victims and the medical professionals tasked with treating them. The public has simply become too desensitized to headlines about mass carnage in schools, supermarkets, and workplaces. For that reason, there has been debate among the media for years now about whether publishing graphic images of gaping wounds or bloody classrooms might help awaken people to the scale of the crisis. (We even hear a TV reporter make that case to a security guard in this very episode.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s time, with the permission of a surviving parent, to show what a slaughtered 7-year-old looks like,” David Boardman, Temple University’s journalism school dean and former executive editor of the Seattle Times, tweeted after the massacre of 19 elementary school students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022.\n\n“Maybe the shock to the system would prompt our leaders to figure out how to make sure society can stop these troubled men … from obtaining these weapons used to slaughter our children,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told viewers after that same mass shooting.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine what grieving parent, if any, would agree to the publication of such images—and who can blame them? It’s not on them to stop the slaughter; it’s on our elected leaders. Perhaps it’s those people, then, who should be forced to see such disturbing images prior to every vote they cast in accordance with the wishes of the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the rest of us, for now, there’s The Pitt. It’s hardly the first medical show to depict the aftermath of a mass shooting, but it might be the most realistic and visceral, and for that reason, it may have the most potential to cut deep and spur change. I can only hope that everyone who watches it undergoes the same transformation as one of the show’s own characters, Dr. John Shen (Ken Kirby). When Dr. Robby appoints Shen, the night shift attending physician, to act as the point person for triaging victims in the ambulance bay, he seems much too calm for Dr. Robby’s liking. Sipping an iced coffee, Dr. Shen even wonders if it might rain later that day. By the episode’s end, though, he is covered in blood and worried for his own safety amid chatter that the shooter might be headed their way. He seems truly overwhelmed when Dr. Robby tells him there may still be twice as many victims to come. “Jesus,” Dr. Shen mutters. “When is this going to end?” That’s a question for us watching at home too.",

Many of my relatives—including my mother—lived in poverty for their entire lives. They could only focus on day-to-day survival and worrying about how they would get their next meal. For us, this meant that retirement planning was never something we discussed. In fact, I don’t ever recall hearing the word retirement mentioned at all. The idea of having a nest egg or a financial safety net felt like a totally foreign concept.\n\nFew of us have a pension plan, let alone a 401(k). I’m one of the lucky ones. Though it’s never been much, I’ve been able to contribute a small amount from each paycheck to my retirement funds. Now, because of recent economic developments in the United States, coupled with the potential threat to Social Security, I’m starting to worry that I might never be able to retire at all.\n\nSince Donald Trump returned to office, his actions (and threatened actions)—specifically regarding tariffs—have made investors nervous, which has led to market instability and trillions of dollars in losses in the S&P 500. Some economists have warned that there’s a good chance the U.S. may be heading toward a recession. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both recently said they couldn’t rule out that possibility. Because of the way retirement plans are connected to the stock market, many people have experienced—or are waiting to see—a precipitous drop in the funds they thought they had. This disproportionately affects people in lower income brackets—people like me whose accounts don’t have much in them to begin with.\n\nMy employer’s retirement plan has a hybrid structure—half of it is a pension, and the other half is an investment plan similar to a 401(k). The pension part is less volatile and has lower risk, so I’m not nervous about that. The investment half, on the other hand, is a totally different story. Like many other people in this country with investment-based retirement accounts, I’ve been experiencing an increasing sense of dread as I track the daily stock market updates and realize the value of my retirement account is plummeting. As the balance gets smaller, the pit in my stomach seems to grow bigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’ve been contributing to this retirement fund for nearly 15 years now. Financially speaking, I’d consider myself to be lower middle class, so while my monthly contributions may not seem like a huge amount, it’s a lot of money to me, as someone who lives on a tight budget. Diverting that portion of my paycheck into this retirement account has meant I’ve had to forgo nonessential “splurges” and cut other expenses. I’m crushed to see such a shocking drop in that precious fund, which represents years of sacrifice and hard work. It’s also disheartening to think about the devastating financial harm Trump has caused for so many families within the span of just a few weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, another saga currently unfolding in the country is compounding my anxiety about how I will survive in my later years. Trump and Elon Musk (the latter of whom seems to be driving many recent national actions and decisions) appear to have Social Security in their crosshairs, with Musk referring to the critical program as a “Ponzi scheme.” It’s unlikely that Musk, currently the richest man in the world, has any idea about what Social Security means to the millions of people who rely on it to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis makes me very nervous about the future of Social Security. Many other Americans feel the same way. Voters have swarmed town hall events held by GOP lawmakers to express concern and anger about recent changes and potential cuts to the program. “I paid into that my entire career,” a voter from North Carolina said at a town hall meeting, according to an Associated Press story. “I worked from the time I was 16. I paid into that, it’s mine and I want it.”\n\nSome of my family members aren’t even eligible to collect Social Security because they haven’t paid enough into the system. Their only option for income in their senior years is Supplemental Security Income and any benefits that might be available through their state. SSI currently has a minimum benefit payment that is less than $1,000 a month—and that’s assuming there are no cuts or changes to the SSI system. For most people, that’s nowhere near enough to survive on, which is why some seniors are forced to choose between food and utilities or health care and medications. I’ve heard some of my relatives talk about receiving utility shutoff notices or skipping doses of their medication because their grocery bills are taking up so much of their monthly budget. Musk, who some say appears to be on a crusade against seniors due to a combination of “ego and spite,” is unlikely to care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial Security officials have already announced staff reductions and office closures. Other plans reportedly in the works include changes that would make it more difficult for people to file claims or get assistance. A former Social Security commissioner has warned that these and other changes recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency could lead to a “system collapse” and interruption of benefits. Some experts and lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders have predicted that Trump’s goal is to privatize Social Security, a scenario that seems plausible to me, as well.\n\nWith this double whammy putting financial support that I’d hoped could help fund my eventual retirement on shaky ground, I now find myself among the nearly half of Gen Xers who feel like they will need a miracle to be able to retire.\n\nMy retirement fund balance is very modest by most standards. Some might call it minimal. It’s nowhere near enough to cover my current monthly bills. I have no delusions about living my senior years in luxury or with enough disposable income to travel the world. I know that I’ll need to tighten my belt and cut down on any nonessential spending. Still, I had hoped my relatively meager nest egg would be enough to cover my bare necessities and core living expenses. Now, even that simple goal seems like it might be too ambitious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my most optimistic dreams, I had hoped to be able to retire at around age 65, but I accepted the more realistic possibility that I would have to try to keep working until 70 to maximize my retirement benefits. (That’s assuming, of course, that I don’t experience any major health events that derail my plans and take the choices out of my hands.) With even that age-70 timeline now seeming too ambitious, I’m anxious that I might have no choice but to continue working even once my physical or mental health makes that difficult. I’m also sad that after a lifetime of hard work, I might never be able to slow down and relax or spend quality time with my future grandchildren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI strongly hope that I am wrong, and that things change course soon and turn the financial circumstances in a more positive direction. Right now, though, things feel very unstable and worrisome, so it’s wise to try to prepare for challenging times as best as we can. In my case, that means shifting my mindset and not taking retirement as a given. I’m now focusing on cutting expenses, paying down debt, and exploring side hustles and additional sources of extra income. Instead of planning for travel and leisure activities in my postretirement years, I might have to accept the painful reality that, despite my efforts to make things different, retirement might be—as it has been for many of my loved ones—a luxury that I won’t be able to afford.",

But not White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Though she has been busy over the past few days vigorously defending President Donald Trump’s deportations of migrants under dubious legal terms, she has also, in her words, “finally found some time to post a few of my favorite pictures from one of my favorite days”—i.e., her recent wedding to Nicholas Riccio, a real estate developer 32 years her senior.\n\nIn January, the 27-year-old Leavitt joined the second Trump administration as press secretary—the youngest ever to serve in the role, it’s been widely noted—and her tenure thus far has been defined by a steady mix of ridiculous lies and outright hostility to journalists. She’s been front and center, defending every White House whim with the kind of telegenic if sometimes incoherent bombast that the president prefers at the press podium.\n\nThen, on Monday, during the most serious test so far of the Trump administration’s executive authority and the American legal system, Leavitt posted a carousel of images from her wedding to Instagram. According to People, the nuptials took place in January, just “days before President Donald Trump’s second inauguration.” For the event’s location, Leavitt tagged Wentworth by the Sea Country Club, which is in her native New Hampshire. In the photos, she is wearing an updo and a long-sleeved, beaded white gown, and Riccio is in a black tux. He is 59 but actually looks young for his age, or maybe she just looks older than her 27 years—blame the Republican makeup. (I am particularly mesmerized by how her foot is positioned in the second of the photos; the effect is somehow “rom-com poster meets corpse.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeavitt is still a relatively new major player in the Trump orbit, so this may be the first you’re hearing of her personal life and much older husband. She filled in some more details about the relationship last week on The Megyn Kelly Show, calling their love story “atypical.” After graduating from Saint Anselm College, in New Hampshire, where she was on the softball team, Leavitt worked as an assistant press secretary in the first Trump administration. In 2022 she ran for Congress in New Hampshire, winning the Republican nomination but ultimately losing the race. This is when she met Riccio, during a campaign event: “I was speaking. We met and we were acquainted as friends. And then we fell in love,” she told Kelly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have more questions about how that happened, but OK! The two got engaged in late 2023 and welcomed a son last summer, also named Nicholas. That same month, Trump was shot, which reportedly inspired Leavitt to skip maternity leave and get back to work. Less is known about Riccio, though People referred to him as a “millionaire,” and he has spoken about living on the streets for periods as a young man.\n\nSo if you didn’t know that the­ 27-year-old White House press secretary was married to a 59-year-old man, well, now you do. It will be another five years until Leavitt is the age her husband was when she was born, ­­­an interesting corollary to the whole “youngest White House press secretary ever” thing. But in this moment, that’s far from the most eyebrow-raising detail here. It’s possible Leavitt genuinely didn’t think it might be distasteful to crow about her wedding right now, but either way, yikes. The post suggests that, for her, this has been just another week of crushing it at work and sleeping great at night. A scary thought.",

        "content": "Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy sister and I both live in the Midwest. Her son lives locally but her daughter lives on the West Coast, and makes six figures—but the rising cost of living in the area eats up most of her salary. My sister can’t seem to wrap her brain around it. She expects her daughter to shell out whatever cash she needs at the moment.\n\nAt the same time, she will shower whatever funds she does have on her son because “he has it so hard.” (My nephew is a bum and pothead and can’t keep a steady job. ) Her recent wild financial ask of my niece finally brought all these issues to a head.\n\nMy sister got severe storm damage but didn’t want to file a claim since it would cause her rates to go up. Instead, she harassed her daughter to send her twenty grand. My niece sent half the money but said she couldn’t afford anymore. This caused a huge fight, and my niece blocked her mother all together.\n\nMy sister would not shut up about the subject, so I finally snapped. I told her she would have the money if she wasn’t constantly bailing out her son, both figuratively and literally. My nephew has a wrap sheet as long as his arm and the police know him. My niece’s rent is more than both our combined mortgages. My own children live in areas with high costs of living, and struggle to make ends meet—and they both have good careers and spouses to support them. But my niece is alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of hearing me out, my sister didn’t talk to me for a week. Now she is acting like our conversation never happened and back to complaining about how her rich child refuses to help her out. Is it even worth wasting my breath by bringing this up?\n\n—Midwest Money\n\nDear Midwest,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds like your niece could use an advocate. And while it probably does feel like wasting your breath, it’s also not a good idea to let things fester. If your sister’s behavior is rubbing you the wrong way, I would try again to have a conversation about it, but maybe approach the topic more delicately this time.\n\nIn other words, instead of snapping at your sister (and calling her son a bum), try to actively listen to her to see where she’s coming from. Why does it bother her so much that her daughter won’t bail her out? And why is it so important for her to, ironically, bail her son out? Why doesn’t she think the cost of living offsets her daughter’s salary? You don’t have to agree with any of these answers, and many of them are probably ill-informed, but listen to your sister to understand her reasoning. It sounds like she might have some unhealthy associations with money. To your sister, a salary might represent self-worth, and seeing her high-earning daughter not passing on the wealth that she assumes she must have might feel condescending or like a betrayal. I’m not saying it’s right, but people often get ideas like this about money that can warp their logic. Once you understand where she’s coming from, even if you don’t agree with it, you can better advocate for your niece and probably get through to your sister as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever her reasoning is, your sister might be in a better place to hear you out if she feels understood. Once you’ve established that understanding, you can try to explain your perspective and see how she takes it. If she doesn’t take it well, then fine, you’re wasting your breath and might want to avoid the topic altogether. In that case, let her know. Tell her you see her daughter’s side of things, it upsets you that she doesn’t, and that it might be best to avoid the topic altogether.\n\nAlso, how close are you to your niece? Maybe give her a call. She’s probably feeling her own big feelings right now, and it might be nice to know that someone else in the family has her back. These kinds of family dynamics can be tough on a person—especially when it’s our parents—and your niece might need validation from an outsider that her mother is being unfair.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

There’s now several thousand dollars in the account just sitting there not doing anything. My question is: Is it a good idea to invest it now that the economy is tanking? I’m decades away from retirement so I’m not worried about my investments making a bunch of money right now or really any time in the near future. My (again, rookie) assumption is that investing now means it would buy more shares, then I’ll be in better shape when the economy finally recovers.\n\n—It Really Accumulates?\n\nDear Accumulates,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes! Apologies for the pun, but you’re right on the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give readers a little background, it sounds like you did all the right things—opened a retirement account and scheduled automatic savings from, let’s say, a checking account. But you skipped the part where you have to designate specific funds for investing that money, so it was just sitting there, not growing as you’d intended. Look, you could be worse off: you still have that money in the retirement account, and you’ve built up the important habit of regularly making contributions to it.\n\nYou’re absolutely right, the best time to start investing for your future is now. There’s a saying: It’s time in the market, not timing the market. In other words, the sooner you start investing, the better, because you give your money more time to grow. The stock market has a long history of highs and lows, but gradually, over time, it’s steadily increased, and most average, non-billionaires like you and me build wealth by holding these investments for a long while, giving them time to grow.\n\nWhile past performance doesn’t guarantee future return, all we can do is use the information we have available to make the best decision we can. The stock market has tanked many times in the past, and it’s always recovered. In fact, even if timing the market was a good idea, now would theoretically be the best time to start investing because prices are lower than usual. You can think of it as stocks being on sale. (There’s conflicting data on whether or not timing the market this way really makes a difference in the long term, but if it helps put your mind at ease then perhaps it’s useful to think about it like that.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour financial institution should make it easy to get started investing in a broad fund — meaning, an investment fund that spreads your money over a wide range of assets, industries, or sectors instead of just focusing on one area. This gives you some diversification, meaning if one part of the market isn’t doing well, other parts might balance it out. Think of it like a buffet—you’re getting a little bit of everything instead of just one dish. As they say, you don’t want to put all of your eggs in one basket. If you need more help getting started, I like this step-by-step beginner’s guide. Happy saving!\n\n—Kristin",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign to destroy the rule of law and establish an elective dictatorship has coopted the congressional Republican Party and thus eliminated Congress as a coequal branch of government. In the executive branch, he is stamping out all centers of resistance—and indeed of independent thought. The only federal constitutional entity now standing between Trump and his dark triumph is the judiciary.\n\nMost recent discussion about the judges’ response to Trump’s assaults on law and decency has focused on whether the Trump administration will comply with adverse court orders and what courts or anyone else can do if it refuses. Trump minions like Attorney General Pam Bondi and immigration “czar” Tom Homan have openly stated that actions enjoined by courts will “absolutely” continue. It remains to be seen if comments like these will prove to be mere bluster or instead manifest a settled determination to defy the judiciary.\n\nRegardless, Trump’s effort to shake off judicial constraints is not limited to threats of noncompliance. The other blade of the shears is his effort to intimidate judges with threats of impeachment and thereby discourage them from ruling against him in the first place. Trump has expressly called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, who ordered a temporary halt to the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. DOGE-boy Elon Musk endorsed the idea, and eager Republican lackeys in the House have joined the campaign.\n\nTogether, the threats of presidential defiance and congressional impeachment constitute a dangerous attack on the independent judiciary’s power to constrain executive branch action within the limits of statutory and constitutional law.\n\nThe authors of the American Constitution crafted a regime of separate, independent, mutually checking branches. At the beginning, there was some doubt that one of the judges’ checking powers was the authority to determine that executive action violated the Constitution or statutory law. But despite intimations to the contrary by Vice President J.D. Vance, that point was settled in 1803 by Marbury v. Madison and has ever since been a bedrock principle of American constitutionalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo ensure the independence of the judiciary, the Framers wrote into the Constitution devices drawn from British history and their own colonial experience. They insulated federal judges from threats of financial coercion by prohibiting any reduction in their salaries. And they adopted the provision of the English Act of Settlement of 1701 that granted judges tenure “during good behavior.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn practice, this means that federal judges cannot be removed except through the process of impeachment by a majority of the House of Representatives and conviction by two-thirds of the Senate. The constitutional standard for removal of judges is the same as for executive branch officers—whether they committed “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nRelated From Slate Lawyers Can Slow a Trump Dictatorship. They Have to Do Something Uncomfortable First. Read More\n\nThis standard has been applied a bit more expansively to judges than to presidents or other executive branch officers. The main difference is that, precisely because judges have life tenure, it has been thought appropriate in several cases to impeach judges for extreme personal incapacity. The primary example is Judge John Pickering, who was impeached, convicted, and removed in 1804—nominally for improper rulings, drunkenness, and blasphemy, but actually because he was severely mentally ill. With the exception of Judge Pickering and Judge Mark H. Delahay, who was impeached in 1873 for being habitually drunk on the bench and resigned before he could be tried in the Senate, all 11 successful removals by impeachment of judges have involved charges of treason, corruption, perjury, or other ordinary crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one point that has been clear since 1805 is that impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” do not include judicial rulings or judicial expressions of opinion of which congressmen, or for that matter presidents, happen to disapprove. In 1804, the House impeached Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The justice—a large, cranky, imperious, sometimes tyrannical judge—was also an outspoken advocate of the positions of the Federalist Party and opponent of Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic Republicans. By 1803, the Democratic Republicans held a House majority of 103–39. In 1804, they impeached Chase, charging him in eight articles with a variety of erroneous legal rulings and with giving a politically oriented charge to a grand jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs John Quincy Adams observed at the time, “this was a party prosecution.” Indeed, in the Senate trial the following year, Chase’s opponents made explicit that they sought his removal because they disapproved of both his particular rulings and his political opinions. Sen. William Branch Giles declared:\n\nA trial and removal of a judge upon impeachment need not imply any criminality or corruption in him … [but] nothing more than a declaration of Congress to this effect: You hold dangerous opinions, and if you are suffered to carry them into effect you will work the destruction of the nation. We want your offices, for the purpose of giving them to men who will fill them better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite a Jeffersonian majority of 25–9, the Senate rejected this view of judicial impeachment and acquitted Chase on all counts. Ever since, Chase’s acquittal has been understood to establish the principle that judges ought not be impeached based on either their political orientation or the substance of their judicial rulings. As Justice William Rehnquist observed in his 1992 book on the Chase and Andrew Johnson impeachments, Chase’s acquittal “assured the independence of federal judges from congressional oversight of the decisions they made in the cases that came before them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRehnquist represents the consensus view. As the House Judiciary Committee wrote in its report on the impeachment of Judge George English in 1926, “No judge may be impeached for a wrong decision.” The reason this principle has been so long accepted is plain. If judges can be impeached whenever they render opinions unacceptable to a congressional majority, then judicial independence becomes a mere fiction, and an essential element of the Constitution’s system of checks and balances disappears.\n\nOf course, neither the antiquity nor the indispensability of this constitutional norm has prevented politicians from agitating for impeachment of judges whose opinions they dislike. Gerald Ford, when a member of the House, wanted to impeach Justice William O. Douglas, in part for alleged ethical lapses and in part for his assertedly radical political views. In 1996, Republican Sen. Bob Dole suggested impeaching judges appointed by President Bill Clinton for supposedly being soft on crime. The next year, Republican Rep. Tom DeLay advocated impeaching three judges, citing their judicial opinions in particular cases. In 2003, Republican legislators again threatened judges whose criminal sentencing opinions they disliked with impeachment. In recent years, these threats have emanated primarily from Republicans, but Democrats have not been immune from the temptation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, since 1805 this sort of performative saber-rattling has never resulted in an actual impeachment, or indeed even in a formal impeachment investigation, based on congressional disagreement with the substance of a judge’s rulings.\n\nTwo factors make the current situation dangerously different.\n\nFirst, the House of Representatives is now controlled by a Republican majority which seems perfectly prepared to investigate and indeed impeach officials it does not like regardless of whether they have engaged in conduct remotely approximating “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” In February 2024, House Republicans impeached Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, although the Senate refused to consider the matter. The Republicans’ allegations (despite some obfuscatory rhetoric) were based entirely on the fact that Mayorkas had executed Biden administration immigration policy with which they disagreed. Policy disagreements are not “high crimes and misdemeanors” and had never before been viewed as an acceptable ground for impeaching an executive branch officer.\n\nSecond, current threats to impeach judges who are ruling against the Trump administration are not merely attention-seeking ploys by a few House members. Rather, the threats are emanating jointly from members of Congress, Trump himself, and senior members of his administration. In short, these impeachment threats are an integral component of a conscious, coordinated campaign by Republicans in the legislative and executive branches to intimidate the federal judiciary. This is an ominous first in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes the addition of impeachment threats to Trump’s campaign against the judiciary dangerous as well as novel is that it has a very real prospect of achieving at least some of its objectives. Given the requirement of a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, there is no realistic prospect that any federal judge who rules against Trump will be removed from office through the vehicle of impeachment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, even an impeachment investigation is a tremendously burdensome and unpleasant experience for its target. It requires a huge expenditure of time and, given the probable need for counsel, potentially large sums of money. Regardless of its outcome, it will inevitably be damaging to the target’s reputation, a point particularly vital to judges whose authority depends importantly on the public perception of probity and neutrality.\n\nMoreover, in our current degraded era of deep division and nasty public discourse, judges threatened with impeachment by the president and his minions will at the least be subjected to torrents of ugly social media abuse—abuse that will, as night follows day, be extended to their families. Worse still, judicial targets of Trump-inspired impeachment campaigns will properly share the concerns for their own safety and that of their families that other judges have already voiced.\n\nJudges are only human. At least some may be intimidated into rulings upholding Trumpian misconduct that they would not otherwise issue. Even those made of sterner stuff are very likely to hesitate before putting themselves in Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nIn sum, current Trumpian threats of judicial impeachment cannot be waved off as mere bluster. They are instead a carefully calculated component of a coordinated assault on the judiciary’s power to maintain the rule of law.",

Big Mother: My mother recently installed an indoor smart camera at our family cabin “for security,” and insists it is left on even when we’re there (i.e. just my husband and I or with my other siblings and their partners, friends, what have you). We all feel very uncomfortable with this, as none of us trust her not to spy on us or use it against us. She insists she’ll never look at it when we’re there and that we’re never to unplug it just in case, but just recently we were up and put a box over it (it has a 360-degree swivel so it’s not as simple as blocking it) and she lost it on us, and said I know who covered it, all but proving our fears that she is using it to spy on us… This feels so invasive and inappropriate, and borderline illegal. It has always been a family cottage that we’ve all shared but now we feel so uncomfortable. Help!\n\nA: If you’re a co-owner of the cabin, stand firm, continue to cover the camera, and let her lose it on you if she wants. If “family cottage that we’ve all shared” translates to “cottage that my parents own and let me use for free,” I’m afraid you’ll have to play by your mom’s rules or head on over to Airbnb.\n\nQ. Sick Breakup: Am I a horrible person for wanting to break up with my boyfriend now that he has a long COVID? My boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months and he got COVID about a month ago. Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was. I realized shortly before he contracted COVID that there were some big choices he made in his life that I wouldn’t want in a long-term partner. After that point, I was fine with us being in a not-so-serious relationship until one of us wanted out, but I figured he probably wouldn’t want that. I was going to talk to him about this, but then he got COVID. He’s been struggling so much and I feel terrible for him. He hasn’t been up for much fun stuff and he has been leaning on me for help a lot more than before. He has friends he could ask but he keeps saying, “This is stuff a girlfriend is supposed to do.” If I didn’t have such a good support system, I think I’d be miserable. I just want out but that seems like I’d be kicking him when he’s down. To top it all off, he’s good friends with a good friend of mine, so I know this might cause a rift in that friend group. Is there any way I can break up with him without seeming like a horrible person?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: “Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was” is all I needed to hear. You’re not breaking up with him because he has a long COVID, you’re breaking up with him because you were never that crazy about him. Not to mention, he’s placing weird gender-based demands on you and seems like a little bit of a jerk. People end relationships all the time. Get out ASAP and I promise you, the friend group will get over it.\n\nQ. The Silver Fox: I am dating a man who is 78 years old. He is cheerful, active, and really seems to get me. My mother is against me seeing him, saying he only sees me as a “trophy girlfriend” and an ego-booster. Prudence, I am 34, and I don’t feel that is too large of an age gap. What should I do?\n\nA: If you like it, I love it. Your mother may be totally right about how he feels, but you are completely grown up and get to make your own choices, and you’re happy. Remind her of that.\n\nQ. Domestically Challenged: I’m a 26-year-old person (they/them) with ADD. I struggle a lot with executive functioning; messy rooms, laundry piling up, dishes sitting out… (Due to my physical and mental health, I currently live at home.) I don’t like being messy, but no matter how hard I try I can’t get past that barrier. I have found over the years that I function best when I live with someone else; when I’ve lived alone for school the mess has been even worse, there’s been no structure to my days, and I’ve often ended up skipping meals (or filling up on snacks), whereas in a shared space I feel responsible for cooking a real meal for everyone and keeping to a schedule, and I feel bad if I let stuff pile up too much. Part of it is a division of labor—if I cook and someone else does the dishes, of course, the dishes get done—but part of it is just me needing external motivation. What I’m concerned about is this: If I ever have the means to move out, and if I end up living with a potential future partner, isn’t that unfair to them? Surely even someone who loves me won’t want to be responsible for making sure I behave like a functional adult? I feel an enormous amount of shame about my inability to handle this on my own, and I’m worried that it will sour any romantic relationship beyond repair. Will it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think stigma around having ADD has made you feel like your challenges are somehow more shameful than those of people who don’t have a diagnosis. They’re not! Everyone brings their own stuff to a relationship, including some qualities that could be considered “unfair” to a partner. Student loan debt. Ailing parents. Seasonal affective disorder. Hair that falls out and clogs up the tub. Snoring. A person who wants to be in a relationship with you will do it because you’ve been honest about what it’s like to live with you and because they’ve decided the good qualities you bring to the table balance out your shortcomings. Be totally transparent about what you can and can’t do, what you’re working on (there probably are some strategies you could use, with the help of a counselor or coach), and what’s a permanent part of your life. And make sure you remember that you have strengths and delightful quirks, too (you didn’t list them but I’m sure you do). There’s more to being in a relationship than housekeeping.\n\nQ. Ballet: I’m a senior in high school. One thing that I’ve always loved is ballet. I love watching it and analyzing it, and I used to dance when I was very young. However, I had to be pulled out because I kept getting skin infections and lung problems. Even now, I still look back on that and I feel sick because of how much I wanted to continue. I remember crying in my parents’ arms when they told me I wouldn’t go back. I tried to forget it until two people came into my life. Both are incredibly skilled dancers, both with experience in ballet. So much so that one of them does it professionally, and the other is currently being recruited. Every single time they bring up their experiences I can’t help but feel some jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI value both of them highly, one of them is my best friend. I would defend them to the moon and back! I can’t just go “Hey, whenever you bring up the fact you’re literally basically a pro in what was one of my dreams as a kid it kinda makes me feel like crawling in a sewer and getting eaten by a croc!” and ask them never to talk about it. They’re passionate about what they do, and I love that for them! I attend performances, compliment their dancing, and I will happily watch videos they show me about their skills. I just feel so terrible about being so jealous of something that will never come to fruition for me.\n\nI don’t want to go into ballet professionally anymore—and there is no possible way I could. From what I’ve seen, I don’t even have a chance to go en pointe. But still, seeing two close people in my life excel in something that I barely ever had a chance to do makes me almost want to mourn, and I don’t even know why. It’s been almost 10 years. How do I get over this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Congratulations on handling the jealousy. Seriously. It says a lot about you that you’ve been such a good, supportive friend to these people who remind you so much of something you desperately want for yourself.\n\nNow listen carefully: Sign up for a ballet class! Your health is better now. You’re barely older than Misty Copeland was when she started! I’m not saying you’ll go pro—I believe you that you won’t. And I’ll take your word for it that you might not even go en pointe. But you love ballet and you can do ballet a few times a week if you want. You don’t have to keep getting better and better. You can just do as much ballet as your body allows, and enjoy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen, and if, you feel like you’ve maxed out, I can see one of two scenarios happening: Either you shift to a different kind of dance (like modern, hip-hop, or tap that gives you a new challenge, a new group of people to learn with, and opportunities to perform) or you find a way to get involved in ballet in a different way. Could you teach toddlers? Or work at a dance summer camp? Or get a part-time job doing something on the administrative side for a studio or company? The opportunities are endless and I really believe your passion will lead you to something that’s a much better use of your time and energy than suppressing jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: That’s it for today, friends.

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers for Happy Face.\n\nParamount+’s new series Happy Face seeks to be both a true-crime drama and a critique of the genre—having its cake and eating it too, dramatically speaking. The series is based on a memoir and spinoff podcast by Melissa G. Moore, and explores her coming to terms with learning Keith Jesperson, the father she loved and adored as a child, led a double life as the notorious “Happy Face” serial killer (so dubbed due to his fondness for leaving confessions signed with a happy face at the scene of his crimes).\n\nHowever, the focus of the series is not really on Jesperson’s crimes and bringing him to justice (he’s already serving a life sentence when the story starts), but rather on the rippling impact of the murders on members of the victims’ wider families, including young people who were not yet born when the crimes took place. This bit of time-bending allows the story room to explore Moore’s own complex family dynamics.\n\nAt the same time, the series looks at how the expanding (and lucrative) true-crime media ecology has turned psychopaths into objects of fascination and, if not actual role models, at least cult figures … even as Happy Face itself contributes to this phenomenon. (It’s worth noting that it could be argued this has been happening since the days of Jack the Ripper.) In any case, here we look at this account of a daughter coming to terms with loving an evil father to determine where it’s myth-building and where it’s myth-busting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa Accidentally Stumble Into Investigative Crime Reporting as a Makeup Artist for a Dr. Phil–Like Television Show?\n\nIn the series, Melissa Reed (Annaleigh Ashford) is working as a makeup artist for the Dr. Greg Show, a sort of Dr. Phil/Dr. Oz–like talk show where the charismatic Dr. Greg (David Harewood) provides informal counseling, in front of a live audience, to people dealing with some kind of psychological trauma, including those who have lost a loved one to violence. One day, Melissa’s estranged father, the convicted serial killer Keith Jesperson (Dennis Quaid)—who is serving time for eight femicides—phones the show wanting to confess to one more murder, but says he will only confide the details to Melissa.\n\nMelissa wants no contact with her father, but Dr. Greg is naturally thrilled to have an inside line to this juicy story and gets his ambitious producer, Ivy, to convince Melissa to cooperate by pointing out that Keith’s revelations might help another family find closure, which results in the two going to visit Keith in an Oregon penitentiary. Although Melissa is determined not to let Keith back into her life, he lures her in by telling her that his ninth victim was a bartender he picked up when he came across her hitchhiking in Texas. When Melissa learns that the bartender’s boyfriend is on death row for the murder and awaiting imminent execution, she and Ivy feel obligated to get the case reopened. They start interviewing people connected to the case, and Melissa proves to be a natural journalist, knowing when to confront and when to back off and possessing a remarkable ability to get people to open up to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real Melissa G. Moore never worked for a Dr. Phil–like show in any capacity or, as far as is known, worked in the media at all prior to 2008. Nor has there ever been a nationally syndicated talk show hosted by a doctor emanating from the Pacific Northwest. Moore did get to know psychologist Phil “Dr. Phil” McGraw in June 2008 when she attended a “Get Real Retreat,” an intense three-day therapy session hosted by McGraw. McGraw had suggested Moore attend after she wrote to him in desperation asking if she should continue to have a relationship with her father. McGraw advised her to have nothing more to do with Keith (unlike the series’ Dr. Greg, who, again, suggests she resume contact for the sake of the show).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor 15 years, the secret of Moore’s past had been known only to her husband and her best friend. However, she later said the Get Real Retreat helped her to stop feeling shame and open up about her situation, recalling, “I went on the retreat to find out if I should have a relationship with my father. I know that sounds absurd now, but I was receiving letters and I felt so guilty as a daughter. He was my father and didn’t have a conscience; he didn’t show remorse for the victims. I took it upon myself to feel that burden, that guilt, for him, and I didn’t realize I did that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa Really Refuse to Capitalize on Her 15 Minutes of Fame?\n\nIn the series, after Melissa’s appearance on his show generates a huge public response, Dr. Greg invites her and her husband, Ben (James Wolk), to dinner with him and his wife. Expecting a casual dinner party, Melissa arrives at Dr. Greg’s impressive home to find an array of terrifyingly well-groomed people who turn out to be Dr. Greg’s television agent, his literary agent, a film producer, his social media agent, and all the other enablers of a modern media career. They all seem to want to get to know her and are hungry for more salacious details of her father’s crimes and what it was like to live with a serial killer. Pleading a headache, Melissa leaves the dinner early, although Dr. Greg reminds her: “This is your moment,” and says that she should seize the opportunity. Melissa insists she has no interest in a big media career and just wants to get the man wrongly convicted for what she thinks was her father’s crime exonerated and then go back to normal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, after a November 2008 appearance on the Dr. Phil show based on her therapy at the Get Real Retreat, Melissa was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show and a 20/20 special on ABC. She appeared in an episode of the true-crime television series Evil Lives Here and was a correspondent for a program called Crime Watch Daily. Far from dismissing the suggestion that she write a book, as she does in the series, she did exactly that at Dr. Phil’s urging and in 2009 published Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer’s Daughter, which led to the Oprah interview that really put her on the media map. She then followed this up with two more books, both around the theme of recovering from a bad upbringing and childhood trauma. She also produced two true-crime podcast series—Happy Face and Life After Happy Face—and helped create the A&E series Monster in My Family, which explores how being connected to notorious criminals has affected the lives of individual people.\n\nAccording to Moore, she was motivated not by finding fame but by helping others, telling the BBC in 2014, “After I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2009, I received hundreds of emails from family members of other serial killers thanking me for telling my story, and asking for help and advice.” She also said she has created a network of more than 300 people who are related to killers, to whom she speaks both on the phone and in person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Moore’s Investigations Overturn a Death Penalty Verdict?\n\nIn the show, Melissa and Ivy discover that the ninth victim Keith told them he killed was not only a bartender, but a talented singer-songwriter named Heather. They further discover (as mentioned above) that Heather’s then-boyfriend, Elijah, another musician, was convicted of her murder and has been on death row for decades, although he has always maintained his innocence. They team up with Elijah’s sister, who has advocated tirelessly for her brother over many years. After many twists and turns, including uncovering a corrupt district attorney who arranged for DNA evidence to disappear and finding that Keith arranged for evidence to be fabricated to connect him to the crime, they prove Elijah’s innocence. Then, displaying nearly Sherlockian detecting skills, Melissa deduces who the real killer is and manages to get a confession from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, there was no Heather and thus no Elijah. Most of Jesperson’s victims were sex workers and transients whom he picked up when they were hitchhiking, not aspiring musicians. As for the wrong person being locked up, the show’s creators appear to have done some conflating with the case of Jesperson’s first victim, a young woman named Taunja Bennett, whom he raped and killed in 1990 in Portland, Oregon. At first, he got away with the murder because a local woman named Laverne Pavlinac told police she had helped her partner John Sosnovske rape and kill Bennett—she later confessed that she had invented the confession to get revenge against Sosnovske for domestic abuse. The lead detective on the case told the Netflix true-crime program Catching Killers that he genuinely believed the “grandmotherly” (she was 57) Pavlinac’s story. Both Pavlinac and Sosnovske were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurious that someone else had claimed “credit” for his work, Jesperson (a long-distance trucker) left “confessions” for the authorities scrawled on the bathroom walls of truck stops and wrote letters to various media outlets, signing each one with the smiley face that gave him his tabloid name. All were ignored, but one six-page missive, in which he confessed to subsequent murders, saying, “She was my first, and I thought I would not do it again. But I was wrong,” went to the Oregonian. There, investigative journalist Phil Stanford did take him seriously and wrote several columns alleging that Pavlinac and Sosnovske had been wrongly convicted.\n\nThen, in March 1994, Jesperson was arrested for the murder of another victim and confessed to seven other murders, including Bennett’s. After he provided details of her murder that only the killer could have known, even the state prosecutors were asking for the couple, who by now had served five years, to be freed. Meanwhile, Taunja Bennett’s sister became an outspoken critic of how the case had been handled as it resulted in the real murderer escaping justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa’s Father Kill Her Kittens?\n\nAt Dr. Greg’s dinner party, Melissa recounts a chilling story of caring for some kittens in the basement as a child until her father found them and hung them by their tails from a clothesline as an anguished Melissa watched, her father smiling as the kittens writhed and scratched themselves to death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis actually happened. As Moore told the BBC, “When I was 5, I found these beautiful little kittens in the cellar of our farmhouse and I took them outside to play with. When my dad saw what I had in my hands he took them, casually hung them up on the clothesline, and began to torment them. I remembered his enjoyment as I screamed and pleaded with him to take them down. Later on, I found their little bodies in the back garden.” Furthermore, in common with many serial killers, Jesperson had a history of torturing animals dating back to childhood.\n\nIs There Really a Market for Jesperson’s Art?\n\nThe series shows Keith making contact with his granddaughter Hazel, whom Melissa has tried to keep unaware of his existence, by sending her a hand-drawn birthday card. As the two clandestinely start talking by phone, he sends her several drawings. Hazel, something of an outcast, is delighted to find that rather than attacking her for having a serial killer as a grandfather, the class mean girls think it’s cool, and the cute boy she has a crush on offers to let her use his internet payment account if she wants to sell the drawings online. It turns out there is a viable market for Keith’s artwork, not only from internet buyers but also from a museum devoted to serial killers.\n\nAlthough it is not known if Moore’s daughter (who is not called Hazel) ever contacted her grandfather, there is indeed a market for Jesperson’s drawings, with works selling for up to $600. There are also no fewer than three museums in the U.S. exhibiting memorabilia connected to serial killers—one with locations in Hollywood and New Orleans, one in North Carolina, and one in Tennessee.",

        "title": "Good American Family: Hulu’s Natalia Grace show has a fundamental problem.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Almost everyone involved in the tabloid saga surrounding Natalia Grace has a story they’re frantically trying to tell the world about themselves. That’s a problem for Good American Family, Hulu’s new limited dramatic series based on the case that aspires to arrive at some stable truth. Showrunners Katie Robbins and Sarah Sutherland gesture toward a Rashomon-style exploration of the many clashing perspectives on Natalia, but, by show’s end, the series makes its own judgments pretty clear. It’s unfortunate that after Good American Family had finished filming last year, the explosive documentary series that made Natalia Grace famous dropped a new season in January, revealing that the warmhearted, salt-of-the-earth saviors whom Good American Family picks as its heroes may not be such heroes in real life after all.\n\nFor newcomers, here are the basics: Natalia was born in Ukraine in 2003 with a rare form of dwarfism and was surrendered by her birth mother to an orphanage. When the first American family she was placed with in the United States found themselves unable to provide her with the care she needed, Natalia was adopted by Kristine and Michael Barnett, an Indiana couple, in 2010. In 2012, the Barnetts successfully petitioned the county court to have Natalia’s legal age changed from 8 to 22, claiming that she was an adult posing as a child and that she had threatened Kristine, Michael, and their three sons.\n\nThe Barnetts’ claims became the subject of a sensationalized 2023 Investigation Discovery documentary series, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, which in its second season followed up by presenting Natalia’s counterclaim—since proven—that she was in fact only 8 years old when the Barnetts installed her, alone, in an apartment and departed for Canada. The rare true story that can be related with the kind of twists more typically found in fiction, Natalia’s ordeal seemed to conclude with some heartland-pleasing uplift when a big, pious family took her in and adopted her. Yet that second season ended on an uncertain note, one that suggested all was not well in Natalia’s new home. Sure enough, Season 3, released two months ago, revealed that Natalia is now estranged from her third adoptive family and living with a fourth, this one made up of other little people. How could any dramatization keep up?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a documentary, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace had to get by without the input of Kristine Barnett, who called the film series “sensationalized” in a statement. Good American Family, however, is free to speculate. Played by Ellen Pompeo, this Kristine epitomizes that most hateable of demographics, a white suburban middle-class woman preoccupied with her own virtue. The story this Kristine’s selling is that she saved her son Jacob from doctors who told her that his autism made it unlikely that he’d ever speak or live independently. Refusing to accept this, Kristine developed her own educational program for Jacob that revealed him to possess genius-level gifts in mathematics and physics. As the Hulu series opens, she’s spinning this success into a book and a chain of day care centers for disabled children.\n\nThe first four episodes of Good American Family present Kristine’s version of what happened after the Barnetts decided to adopt Natalia. This tale, the series implies, was strongly influenced by the 2009 horror film Orphan, in which a family is terrorized by a grown woman posing as a 9-year-old child. Kristine cites the movie when discussing her suspicions with her best friend (Sarayu Blue). Natalia (Imogen Faith Reid) shows a marked preference for the gullible, needy Michael (Mark Duplass), playing the adorable kid when her adoptive father is around and saving her evil smiles for Kristine when his back is turned. At one point, Natalia steals and mutilates one of her adoptive brother’s favorite stuffed animals and appears in Michael and Kristine’s bedroom at night, holding a knife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Good American Family would have it, before the adoption, Kristine expected to add another rescued child to her résumé. “When God has a job for you, he gives you everything you need to get it done,” she tells the initially reluctant Michael. Natalia proves a more difficult project than Jacob had been, but Kristine cannot admit—to herself as much as to the world—that there are limits to her God-given powers to help disabled kids. Instead, she convinces herself that Natalia isn’t a kid at all. For a while, Good American Family seems to be deploying the classic “she was right all along” trope so popular in women’s fiction, but Kristine is no Cassandra. She’s a woman desperately fighting to preserve the narrative that holds her life together. “Do you think she believes all her lies?” a character asks Natalia near the end of the series. Natalia doesn’t care, but Good American Family seems to think that Kristine does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last half of the series switches to Natalia’s perspective after the Barnetts abandon her in a shabby apartment. She watches TV all day, goes without bathing because she hasn’t got the strength to turn the taps on the tub, and resorts to gnawing on bricks of uncooked ramen when she gets hungry. Reid, who clearly relishes the range she gets to show here—from smirking goblin to vulnerable waif—holds on to Natalia’s essential oddness, the product of unknown but formative trauma. If Natalia weren’t so unlike anyone the people around her had met before, it would have been much harder for the Barnetts to convince them that she was an adult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalvation comes in the form of the ever-sumptuous Christina Hendricks as Cynthia Mans, wife of a preacher and foster mother to a house full of children, not all of whom are her own. “I was born to be a mother,” she tells Natalia, who, after some initial resistance, happily sinks into the puddle of kids that gather around her. Good American Family doesn’t shy away from the use the Mans family made of Natalia’s benefits, but it’s hard to believe that Hendricks in earth-mother mode, telling sassy truths and dispensing hugs, could be anything but benevolent.\n\nRelated From Slate Netflix’s New No. 1 Hit Is One of the Best Shows of the Year Read More\n\nAt first, aware that people interviewed in Season 3 of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace say they witnessed Cynthia’s husband slapping Natalia, whipping her with a strap, and locking her up in a room, I assumed that Cynthia’s down-home maternalism, like Kristine’s TED Talk–style inspirational motherhood, would soon be revealed by Good American Family as just another false narrative. Certainly the Mans family’s habit of conspicuously joining in prayer in public spaces like courtroom lobbies seems every bit as off-puttingly performative as Kristine’s TV interviews. Not that there isn’t a surprising amount of God talk from both sides in Good American Family—when Kristine and Michael lock Natalia in the garage as a punishment, the cop who comes to check out the neighbors’ reports of screams is readily pacified by Kristine’s mentioning what good, churchgoing Christians the Barnetts are. But it comes across that Good American Family’s creators really do want viewers to view Cynthia and Antwon Mans’ family—working class, casually groomed, multiracial—to represent real Christianity and real parental love in contrast with Kristine’s uptight, appearance-obsessed, self-centered, careerist versions of both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow inconvenient, then, that in real life, the Manses also turned out to be the sort of family Natalia needed to escape. The best the makers of Good American Family can do is post a statement acknowledging the new allegations at the end of the final episode, even though this essentially capsizes the story the showrunners themselves have just spent eight episodes telling. The closest thing the series offers to a resolution comes when a disconsolate Natalia comes home to the Mans house after learning that the criminal case against the Barnetts has not gone well. She walks in to find some of her adoptive siblings gathered around a laptop in delight. Despite her difficulties in finding justice, the internet is flooded with messages of support for Natalia, and as she reads them, her face brightens.

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nWe hear about “failing up” all the time, but what about succeeding nowhere? I work as a marketing executive and for the last four or five positions I’ve had, I’ve achieved all the goals the companies wanted. I’ve quadrupled revenue, helped products become enormous successes, won national awards for the company, fixed failing initiatives, built highly successful teams, and doubled and tripled new customers. Yet, within two years, I always end up running into problems with leadership. They see the success. They know my work is making them money (and even saving the business at times), but inevitably, I get in a position where the CEO or president decides they are unhappy and I end up being shoved along with a sizable payout. It’s not like I start to fail or stagnate—I continue to add value and make them money. So why? What is going wrong?\n\n—Succeeding Nowhere\n\nDear Succeeding Nowhere,\n\nGiven that you’ve been laid off from your last four or five jobs, I know it’s really, really tempting to ask yourself, “Am I the drama?” And if you had written to me 20 years ago, I may have said yes. But given our current capitalist hellscape, it’s entirely possible that you’re not.\n\nWorking in journalism, I know people who have been laid off from every job they’ve ever had! It’s just the nature of our current world. It also sounds like you’re pretty senior, which means that you’re probably an expensive hire. So even if you’re bringing a lot of value to the table, you’re also costing the company a lot. When the higher-ups are looking at their bottom line, they’re often cutting the people with the highest salaries first. It sucks. I say this to just offer the idea that there really is no smoking gun here, and you may have just been the victim of bad luck and a crappy economy, in which case, all you can do is keep going and hope that your next job offers more stability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that being said … maybe you are the drama! If you think it’s remotely possible that it is you and something you’re doing, I wonder if there is a trusted former colleague with whom you could have an honest conversation about what went wrong. (It’s unlikely that asking your manager or human resources will yield anything productive, because for legal reasons, they probably will not want to go into it.) But you might unwittingly be doing something that has been a turnoff for multiple employers, and if that’s the case, it’s worth uncovering what that is. You could also have a conversation with an executive coach (but do some serious vetting before you hire someone—look for someone who has experience coaching people at your level and in your industry, ask about their methodology and how they measure success, and check some of their references from satisfied customers), who might be able to offer some pointers and strategies about navigating the workplace so that you’re better prepared when you get hired for your next role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Your Questions to Good Job!\n\nLaura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nRecently, we had a new manager join our office. He knows a lot about our industry and is experienced. However, he came to our city from Manhattan, and he brings a lot of “habits” that have been causing a lot of the other staff anxiety and stress, to the point where almost half of the department wants to quit!\n\nEveryone here is productive, but we are nothing like the “Manhattan work culture” that he is accustomed to, and he doesn’t realize that this city is smaller, a bit more laid-back, and we’re not stepping on each other’s necks to prove our worth. He constantly moves deadlines a week early and acts like every task is a top priority. He gets annoyed when the staff takes their full hour for lunch, and asks why they can’t “multitask and just eat at their desk while working.” He is constantly worried about being terminated. Someone sent an internal memo out, that was missing a period, and he was packing up his office because he thought he would get fired! Since the memo incident, he has become over-demanding, to the point where is starting to micromanage everyone, and not trust anyone to do their jobs. How do I let him know that this city is NOT Manhattan, that he needs to slow down, and that the C-suite isn’t trying to fire anyone over a typo?\n\n—Working in the Little Apple\n\nDear Working in the Little Apple,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’ve certainly had my share of managers who managed from a place of fear and insecurity, which is where it sounds like your manager is coming from. I got through it mostly by gritting my teeth and powering through it—in retrospect, I wish I had had better boundaries and strategies for navigating these types of bosses! This is learned behavior—he had a manager, or managers, who did this to him, and so he internalized that this is how managers should behave. He also may be eager to prove his worth to his new company, especially if he relocated for the job. You might be onto something with your characterization of “Manhattan work culture,” but I wouldn’t blame it all on the city. Sadly, I think micromanagers and intense bosses are prevalent everywhere.\n\nDon’t tell your boss he has to change his work style. Frame your conversation more as a collaboration. Ask for a one-on-one meeting with him where you discuss how the two of you can work together more productively. Do not accuse him of being a micromanager or of bringing Manhattan-flavored work culture into the office—this will make him defensive. I liked a suggestion from Octavia Goredema, the author of Prep, Push, Pivot: Essential Career Strategies for Underrepresented Women, who told the Harvard Business Review that you should focus on how his actions affect your work by saying something like:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Last week I had a deadline for the Jones Project. We exchanged multiple emails leading up to the deadline, which was disruptive and interfered with my ability to concentrate and efficiently complete the project. What can we do differently to ensure you’re confident in my progress, while allowing me to focus on my work?”\n\nI would follow up this meeting with an email where you gently but firmly lay out your own boundaries for how you’d like to be managed by him, stressing that this will allow you to do your best work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know it’s tough right now, but try to give this some time. It sounds like he hasn’t been in your office for that long, and the change of pace might be a culture shock for him, too. Hopefully, once he realizes that things operate a little differently where you live, he’ll take a breath and adapt.\n\nSlate Plus members get more Good Job every week.

The gossiping and backbiting are endless; rumors are perpetually being circulated about who is sleeping with who, how much so-and-so makes, who had plastic surgery, etc. I feel like I’m back in junior high! On second thought, the people I went to junior high with had buckets more maturity. Unfortunately, I live in a high-cost area, and steady, well-paying employment in my field (performing arts) is difficult to come by. What can I do to maintain my sanity?\n\n—Stressed Out in Showbiz\n\nDear Stressed Out in Showbiz,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour workplace sounds exhausting! You must be constantly paranoid that something you said or did will be fodder for the office gossip mill. I think you have two choices here: continue to let yourself be bothered by the gossip and backbiting going on around you, or just quietly remove yourself from the proverbial water cooler conversations.\n\nIt might feel difficult to ice out (or grey rock) an entire workplace, but try to disengage as much as possible. Don’t take part in these conversations. If you hear one going on around you, put headphones on or walk away. If someone tries to share some gossip on Slack or email, either don’t respond or reply with, “So sorry but I’m slammed right now,” and then just never pick the conversation back up. The same goes if they try to corner you in a hall and tell you all about your co-worker’s rumored rhinoplasty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would not suggest leaving your job over this, especially since it sounds like other than the toxicity of some of your fellow employees, it’s a relatively good place to work. Sorry if that sounds a little, “Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?” of me, but given the state of the world, I don’t think you should discount the positive aspects of your job right now. Remind yourself of the reasons why you like your job—even if it’s just the comfort of having a steady paycheck—and drown out the rest of the noise.\n\n—Doree\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI have three kids: two girls and a boy.

        "title": "Bill Burr special: The key to understanding his comedy and politics.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "If you’re looking for a snapshot of Bill Burr’s worldview, I recommend listening to the comedian’s wide-ranging interview he sat for on NPR’s Fresh Air last week. Burr was promoting his latest stand-up special, Drop Dead Years, which premiered on Hulu Friday, and within 15 minutes on NPR, he had already worked himself up into one of his vintage rages. The target of his ire was Elon Musk or, as he put it, the “select few group of nerds” with “dyed hair plugs and a laminated face” who are authoring the end of the American experiment. Burr, with his roughneck Boston accent, asserts that the ascendant tech oligarchy has successfully obfuscated its takeover thanks to the enfeebled preciousness of the liberal mainstream. What exactly does he mean by that? Somehow, he lands on the overreaches of the #MeToo movement: “You can get canceled as a comedian for doing a Caitlyn Jenner joke, but this asshole can Sieg Heil?” he says, referring to Musk’s eyebrow-raising inauguration Nazi salute. “Where are all of these white chicks at the award shows who were speaking truth to power? Why did they choose to go after comedians and not the Ku Klux Klan?”\n\nHis conjecture doesn’t make much sense; #MeToo was about sexual harassment in the workplace, not the confrontation of domestic terrorist organizations. This about sums up Burr’s politics: anti–conservative fascism, anti–liberal PC culture, somewhat incoherent, and always fueled by anger. The acrimony Burr summons, misplaced as it might be, is his comfort zone as a performer—and it’s why the comedian is currently experiencing something of a renaissance among left-leaning souls who are staring in disbelief at the massive losers who have overtaken the country.\n\nRelated From Slate I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here. Read More\n\nLongtime fans of Burr will know that the man has stoked an antipathy for “woke culture” for as long as it’s been in his vocabulary. Before that, he dedicated vast swaths of his material to the haranguing of fat people, trans people, and, most commonly, feminists. A decade ago, I listened to him unveil a lengthy (and not very funny) monologue that, most charitably, could be interpreted as an ontological defense of Chris Brown’s assault of Rihanna. Stuff like that used to condemn you to the reactionary circuit, and yet, at a moment when the Democratic mainstream is tilting away from the identity-driven bindings of the Obama era, Burr and his highly cancellable gestalt have never been hotter. Sure, maybe some of the details are a little messy, the edges a bit rough, but few comedians are tapping into the larger mood and big picture like Burr is right now. When a clip of Burr extolling the virtues of accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione went viral earlier this year, I was not surprised. “Free Luigi!” he declares to applause. Jimmy Kimmel laughs awkwardly: “Oh, we’re back to Luigi. OK.” Burr’s response: “I never left Luigi!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurr’s current renaissance is not the result of a pivot on his part; if anything, it’s a sign of how much the popular culture has shifted around him, taking on a more populist sheen, sick of both politically correct niceties and billionaire worship. Burr’s superpower as a comedian has always been his ability to concoct a frothy exasperation that—when aimed in the correct direction—can have an exfoliating effect on the mind. The impact is most cathartic when Burr deploys that ability on the listless bourgeois. In one of my favorite stand-up bits ever, back in 2012, he asked a very simple question of Steve Jobs: What the fuck did that guy do? (“He told other people what to invent?”) After his recent Mangione apologia picked up steam, a 2017 clip from a Burr appearance on Conan resurfaced; riffing on Nestlé’s attempt to privatize American groundwater, Burr, in a Mangionean turn, asserted that the CEO of Nestlé should be “hunted down and shot.” (“This guy wants to own the rain!”) Another clip, from 2014, that likely won’t travel as far in liberal circles as the others have, sees Burr irritated at Michelle Obama. She had just debuted the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 young women by the extremist group Boko Haram. Burr was beside himself: “I’m a stand-up comedian. What am I going to do to get those girls back? Why don’t you look across the dinner table? You see that guy? That’s the leader of the free world! Tell him to pick up the phone and call some Navy SEALs and solve it!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s the same flavor of rage, meted out to different characters who all have one important thing in common: access to the levers of power, and thus the mantle for why the world is the way it is. Burr has long contended that he speaks for a sensible majority, and if anything, the Trump years have only provided more political grist for the fury mill. It also helps that the comedian is now the father of two young children, born in 2017 and 2020; that life event supplies the most prominent thread in Drop Dead Years. The comedian has a newfound investment in the Earth and those he occupies it with, a feeling that manifests most acutely in the segments when Burr sheds the hard corners of his persona and cops to the conditions of his ignorance. “Men aren’t allowed to be sad. We’re allowed to be mad or fine, that’s it,” he notes, riffing on the limited scope of emotions he’s allowed himself to experience. Minutes later, he admits he suffers from depression—familiar territory in stand-up, but downright revelatory coming from someone who has structured an act on his own righteous defiance. It’s one of the few moments onstage when Burr exposes himself to esoteric forces of the subconscious or, more flatly, the possibility that he doesn’t know everything and he might not always be right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There are a lot of sad men. I know that now that I know how fucked-up I am,” he says. “Ladies, you’re probably married to a sad guy right now. That’s what the garage is for.”\n\nDeeper in that NPR interview, Burr expanded on the roots of his discontent. He grew up in an abusive household that, he said, saddled him with lifelong anger-management issues. This was all apparently clarified by a recent experience he had with psilocybin mushrooms, which allowed Burr to plumb the depths of his soul. (“I started tripping, and this feeling came over me. It was this profound sense of loneliness. … This [was] how I felt growing up, and it blew my mind.”) The vulnerability, the softness, the willingness to introduce a woo-woo West Coast treatment to his hard-nosed East Coast demeanor: I was almost startled to find that Burr is actually beginning to sound more and more like a liberal in ways that go beyond his concerns for the future of democracy. Unlike other comics forged in his mold—guys like Tony Hinchcliffe, who stick to exactly one note of confrontational, antagonistic MAGA-courting material—Burr demonstrates a willingness to grow, and that has, in turn, made him a better writer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat transformation will continue to clash against some of the thornier elements of his act. Toward the end of Drop Dead Years, he deploys a gnarly anti-gay slur to express the ways in which he’d like to see this country’s neo-Nazis be emasculated. (“I was worried I was getting too preachy,” Burr demurs in the punch line.) That instinct, the desire to provoke, is intractable for most comedians, especially those who have grown exceedingly protective of the words they’re allowed to use, and especially for someone like Burr, who is so allergic to partisan lines. It almost comes off like a challenge to the millennial liberal orthodoxy that might be watching: If you want Bill Burr on your side, you must also be willing to stomach his more prickly tangents—no matter how they might make you feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you like it or not, a lot of people in America relate to Burr’s disposition. Can you imagine an American voter who holds some, shall we say, problematic views on pronoun policing or the #MeToo movement, while also harboring a very material sympathy for Luigi Mangione? Someone who is anti-woke but believes that the housing crisis has gotten out of hand? Of course you can—they are legion. They crowd Facebook walls and Instagram feeds, they are invited to our living rooms for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and they are also the exact type of citizen that has been legislated out of the Democratic Party. Bill Burr is their avatar, and the question becomes whether the next phase of liberal culture—for better or worse—will be shaped in his image, one primal scream at a time.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner and I are both queer women (I’m cis, she’s trans), formerly-religious 30-somethings. I went to private Christian school for my entire K-12 education, and her dad is a pastor in a similarly conservative Christian denomination to the one I was raised in, so to a certain degree we are both well-versed in experiencing homophobia from a religious standpoint. However, as I’m cis, I clearly have not had to experience the transphobia my partner has. We’ve been dating for about a year, and her religious parents and other family refuse to use my partner’s correct name or pronouns. Over our first major holidays together, I asked her how she normally dealt with being dead-named by family, and I did as requested and simply corrected any use of their deadname in conversations I was a part of, as though her family was just being silly and forgetting, but not addressing the whole “hey you’re literally using the wrong name” thing directly.\n\nClearly, my partner and I have different ways of dealing with conflict—hers is to minimize conflict in the first place, and mine is to get the conflict over and dealt with. She has done years of the slow and gentle, hope-they’ll-catch-on-eventually method. But I think my methods might be more successful here!\n\nI would like to know if (and, if so, when) it would be appropriate for me to more directly address the way my partner is treated by their family. Her chosen, everyday nickname is one letter off from her deadname. One of the most famous figures of the early Christian church changed his name by one letter. At the next holiday, I would love nothing more than to stand up and say “your child’s name is not [deadname], and if you can call the apostle Paul ‘Paul’ and not ‘Saul,’ then you can and will call your child by the name she has asked you to use.” And then very loudly correct everyone all day. And maybe call everyone “Saul” until they start using the right name, to dig the point in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m begrudgingly willing to Not Do That and either wait to address it later and with less fanfare when our relationship is further established, or continue to follow my partner’s lead in not pressing the issue at all even though it hurts her deeply to be reminded on an ongoing basis that her family does not support or accept who she is. But I’m very bad at policing my facial expressions when I’m upset, and if that’s what I need to do around my partner’s family, then I will need to start practicing sooner rather than later. Any advice would be appreciated!\n\n—Can I Debate Your Dad for You?\n\nDear Debate,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would highly advise against delivering this lecture in any form to your partner’s parents. For one thing, this is still a relatively new relationship for you two. At this stage, you very much need to let your partner set the tone for how to deal with her family (and vice versa), since your family units are not officially combined in any capacity. If you were married, there would be some gray area for how you both could deal with parents and in-laws as a team, but even so, I’m of the mind that other people’s family dynamics are mysterious, idiosyncratic, and rarely worth interfering with. (The exception to this would be in cases where someone is being harmed; if your partner was dealing with outright verbal or emotional abuse from her parents, which isn’t how she seems to view the dead-naming, this would be a different situation.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your partner has asked you to correct their habit of deadnaming and misgendering in a specific and limited way, I would stick to your partner’s wishes. As you noted, your partner’s experience as a trans person is vastly different from your experience as a cis person, which is all the more reason to let her take the lead on how to approach this issue with her family. Put more bluntly: When it comes to matters of identity and family, you have to respect your partner’s wishes and defer to her. You may not agree with her approach (and you’re probably going to show it via your expressions), but you do have a duty to not make these scenarios any more confrontational or awkward than your partner would like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy boyfriend “Ben” and I moved in together a few months ago. Before we moved in, we had some very in-depth talks about how our lives would look. I was pretty happy with the way we were dividing chores, because both of us had opposite likes and dislikes in that area. I’ve started to realize, though, that the time spent on chores is a major sticking point. For example, Ben loves to cook. He will often spend more than an hour on a regular weeknight dinner, longer on the weekends. In contrast, when I was living on my own, I meal prepped, and ate a lot of leftovers to limit my time in the kitchen as much as possible. I am completely fine with that quality of meal and have told Ben multiple times that I would be fine if he worked less on his meals. He said he liked to put the effort in and liked the quality of food, so he was fine with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, apparently, he is only fine with this as long as I am putting in approximately an equal amount of time on my chores. I do laundry, but he wants me to iron most of his clothes and put them away in a very well-presented way, which he himself did not do before we got together. After a few passive aggressive comments, I finally found out that he expected that living together would “elevate” our lifestyle. He did mention that when we were talking, but he didn’t mention that in relation to chores, he mentioned it in the context of nicer nights out and nicer vacations. We both make good money, so I was fine with that. I am not, however, fine with spending way more time on chores than I did when I was single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI brought this up to Ben, and he mentioned that he too was spending more time making our lives better. This has become a very contentious issue between us for the past week. I thought we were clear on chores and that we would be lightening up the load for each other. Ben thought he had been clear about wanting us to improve our homes. I am at a loss because I think everything he wants is incredibly bougie. I don’t want to spend twice as much time doing chores, I just don’t. We’re at a bit of an impasse; how do we move forward?\n\n—Chore Choked\n\nDear Choked,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand where your boyfriend is coming from in terms of wanting to feel like both of you are making “equal” contributions to the household, but it’s unfair of him to use his standard for elaborate daily meals as leverage for you to adhere to his standards for laundry. He’s framing this issue as a matter of an equal exchange of tasks, but it sounds to me like he’s putting his needs first in both situations: he gets to decide how to handle the cooking, and he gets to decide how the laundry is done? That doesn’t sound fair at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, it sounds like you and your boyfriend need to further negotiate the lifestyle you both want to share as a couple, but I think you also need to, uh, negotiate the need for negotiation. First, I think you should come to an agreement that it’s time to do your cooking separately for a while—this way, you can remove that issue as a “bargaining chip” temporarily. Use that time to engage your boyfriend in lower-stakes negotiations about what you both need in the house together, and about what you envision for your lives together in the near future. Take note of how open he is to negotiation and compromise: You want to get a sense for how rigid he is about his standards, and whether he realizes that it’s unfair that everything has to rise to his level of expectation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, in my view, the whole point of moving in with a partner is to make everyone’s lives easier. If that ends up being a point of disagreement, then it may be time to consider moving out and reassessing whether your relationship is better served under a more independent arrangement.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

My husband has been letting himself go lately. My parents raised me on a diet of take-out and junk food, my father died of a heart attack when I was quite young, and my mom is morbidly obese and has serious challenges getting around. As a result, I am a bit sensitive about healthy eating and try to model good behaviors to my kids. My husband crushing a family-sized bag of M&Ms or ordering pizza for all of us seriously undermines that. Prior conversations with my mom about her eating habits went as badly as you might expect and I don’t want to make the same mistakes, but I am worried by my husband’s weight and think we’re not on the same page about parenting our children.\n\n—Fat Shaming Mommy\n\nDear Mommy,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are actually two separate conversations that you need to have with your husband. The first is to address his health and his eating habits. I think you know, as you must have experienced with your mother, that this kind of conversation can be pretty limited.\n\nAll you can really do is to express respect for your husband’s autonomy while also communicating your concerns for his well-being. Something along the lines of, “You’re an adult, and I can’t tell you what to do with your body, but I am dying with worry that you’re not taking as good of care of yourself lately. Is everything okay?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he says he’s fine, the only other thing you can really underscore is that his well-being directly affects the well-being of both your relationship and the entire family’s well-being—“I/We depend on you so much” should be the prevailing vibe, not “You’re doing X wrong, and I’m telling you why.” Beyond that, you may be left at a pretty common impasse on this as a couple. This is, unfortunately, the epic downside of sharing our lives with people we love: They will constantly make choices that we don’t approve of, and we have to deal with the consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation about modeling healthy eating habits for your kids should be slightly more straightforward: It’s not so much a matter of changing someone’s personal habits as it is deciding what is acceptable for the kids to “see.” You may find that you will have to offer to take the lead most of the time on meal planning, grocery-shopping, etc. for the family at large, and in return, you can try to negotiate that your husband keep his snacking more private, or that he defers to you on the matter of family dinners. It’s not an ideal solution where your husband magically changes his habits for the better of the family, but it may be better than your current situation.\n\nWant more Prudie?

She bullied and humiliated me relentlessly, which played a big part in my subsequent depression and eating disorder. Her one gift was to motivate me to get as far away from her and the home we lived in as I could. I studied hard enough to get a scholarship, worked various side hustles and got the hell out, got therapy, got a degree, got a great job, and never looked back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I’m doing great, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I also take quite a lot of satisfaction in the fact that my stepsister isn’t. She was a classic failure to launch. Barely finished high school, fell pregnant to a druggie dirtbag who hit her before dumping her, had another kid and now lives with my dad and her mom.\n\nThe problem is that I do not want to see her and will not visit my home if she is there. My stepmother, who is lovely but didn’t do anything to defend me, is eager to resolve the situation and has also asked me to contribute financially because the family is struggling. I pointed out that my father would be fine if he wasn’t subsidizing her daughter, who I hate, and her two children. Now I’m getting it in the neck from my dad for being “relentless and cruel,” my stepmother isn’t speaking to me at all, and other family members that I actually care about are being dragged into the dispute. I just want to draw a line under this without conceding anything, apologizing when I have done nothing wrong, or giving any money to a woman I despise. Is that ever going to be possible?\n\n—Sister Hater\n\nDear Sister Hater,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot any time soon. To be blunt, if your dad and stepmother are currently under major financial stress, they’re honestly not in a place where they’re going to thoughtfully consider your emotional needs. I think it’s great that you drew a boundary for yourself regarding your stepsister, but you can’t really blame your family members for being angry that you won’t help them out.\n\nObviously, you have your reasons. If your dislike and anger for your stepsister (and stepmother) truly prevents you from finding it meaningful to help your dad, that’s your choice.\n\nBut I think you will have to accept that withholding your money isn’t going to magically make anyone come around to your side. I think you need a bit of distance from your family to work through this anger and disappointment for a while, ideally with a great therapist or support group, so that you can get yourself to a place where you’re less bothered about what your family members think of you—or what they ask of you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Even More Advice From the Dear Prudence Podcast\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy best friend of 50 years lives a different state. We enjoy seeing each other a couple times of year. We also enjoy traveling together, especially as we are both widowed with neither of us having remarried. Since retiring a few years ago, we’ve managed to take at least one significant trip together each year. We are great travel partners, like going at the same pace, and genuinely find joy in discovering the world. My friend has a bucket list country she’d like to visit, and while it’s not high on my list, I’ve gladly agreed to go with her and we’ve started to make preliminary plans for next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that a close friend of my friend has invited themselves to also go on this trip. This is not the first time this has happened. While I like this other friend, she is significantly younger than we are and likes a faster pace of travel. From a logistical standpoint, traveling in three’s can be challenging. I also feel, at times, like a third wheel when I’m with the two of them (they live in the same city and see each other several times a week). I’ve told my friend in the past that I would prefer we keep our travel plans between the two of us. But they feel they have no choice but to agree when their friend asks to come along.\n\nNext year is a long way away, and a lot can change. But I’m tempted to tell my friend sooner rather than later that for this particular trip, I’m bowing out and they should plan to go without me. As mentioned, this country is not a high priority for me. I also know myself and can see becoming a grouchy traveler in the circumstances. I want to honor my friendship but not sure how to handle this. Especially as it has become a pattern the last few years. What say you?\n\n—Wholly Booked\n\nDear Booked,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you can tell your friend pretty much what you said in your letter: You’re bowing out on this trip because this country isn’t high priority for you, and you can already tell that you’re going to be a grouchy traveler. (You don’t even need to explicitly mention the issue of her friend, but if you wanted to, you could be honest and say that you don’t think you can keep up with everyone as part of a trio). Reiterate your desire to go on a “just us” trip with your friend soon, and be clear about how important it is for you to have that one-on-one bonding time with her. If she keeps being unable to draw a line with her friend, gently remind her that you may have to bow out of plans again, since traveling as a trio is honestly a little too taxing for you.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m trying to figure out what to do about a mom at my son’s school. She has a son one year older than mine who screamed at my son after school that he could not play with him and his friends. He has also been rude and mean to my son before. I asked the mom if I could tell him not to yell at my son; she said yes and I did. He didn’t seem to care. I asked the mom about it and she didn’t care either. I see this as a possible beginning of bullying and don’t want my son to have to deal with this as I did when I was young. So, I’ve been avoiding her and her kids. Problem is, one of my best friends is good friends with her too and keeps groups texting us random things. We used to all go places together, like movies, parks and zoos, so it’s a little sad, but I have no problem cutting her off. What in the best way to do this with the least drama and making sure there is minimal effects on the kids?\n\n—Pondering Mama\n\nDear Mama,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it’s fine for you to tell your best friend (one-on-one) that your son simply doesn’t get along with this other boy, and that you and his mother have both agreed to let the boys grow up a little on their own first. Tell your best friend that you still value your friendship with her, but that you’d like to be left out of the group chats for the time being. There’s no need to go into depth about the boys’ relationship or their histories; just be direct and leave it at “they’re not getting along.”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy brother and his wife had my niece from a donated embryo—and plan to never tell her about it. Despite the fact that you can get cheap ancestry tests off Amazon. Their view is that the embryo was genetically screened so my niece will never “need” to ask any health questions about their family history. I told them that was perfectly fucked up. People have a right to their own histories and what made this any different from a regular adoption? My sister-in-law got angry and yelled at me. She gave birth, she was the mom here, and DNA is not anything to that bond. I am not disagreeing. I just think lying to my niece for the rest of her life or until she stumbles onto the truth makes me uncomfortable. My brother and parents told me I needed to shut up and that it wasn’t my place to tell.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband has a gay friend from high school. As an adult, before we married, he traveled to see his friend and for a week hung out with him and other gay men. Once, they went sailing where all of them stripped naked and drank beers—I’ve seen the pictures. My husband is very particular about his appearance and grooming. He recently started to lisp. I suspect he’s gay. When I told a (straight) man about this, his response was that no straight man would have done that (sailed naked with gay men). Am I correct that he is probably at least bisexual?\n\n— Am I Naive?\n\nDear Naive,\n\nIt would feel really weird for me to make a guess about the sexual orientation of a stranger (or really, of anyone), but in the interest of providing a thorough answer to your question, I’ll entertain the points you’ve made. And … I think everything you’ve written here can explained away!\n\nParticular about his appearance: So are a lot of straight men. That’s why nobody says “metrosexual” anymore. It’s called self-care. And it keeps you from being the subject of advice letters from a wife who finds you utterly disgusting because you have food in your beard, smell like an old towel, and haven’t clipped your toenails for a year. This is a good thing.\n\nStripping while sailing and drinking beers with gay men: This strikes me as an activity that would be among the very last things someone who was gay and trying to hide it from his wife would do. Perhaps he’s just secure in his orientation and up for a good time?\n\nNew lisp: It’s unusual but not unheard of for an adult to develop one. Ask him to check with a dentist, ENT, or speech therapist if you’re concerned before accusing him of living a lie. (And of course, not all gay or bi men have lisps!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only real red flag about your marriage here is that you are asking a random, probably-homophobic straight man, as well as me, a stranger, to weigh in on your husband’s sexuality. Again, I have absolutely no idea if you’re correct that he is “probably at least bisexual.” Your gut feeling is worth something. What he says about himself, and how you feel when you hear it, is worth more. Can you—I realize this seems wild but stay with me—start a conversation with him? The fact that you seemingly can’t talk to each other and that you believe he would hide a major part of himself from you concerns me much more than his honestly pretty amazing-sounding vacation, the way he speaks, or the fact that he likes to look nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStop playing detective and sit down for a heart-to-heart with the person you married. If you still don’t believe what he says or trust him to be honest, deal with that rather than asking someone else to judge him against a list of stereotypes.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy sister and I got divorced the same year. Mine was relatively mild compared to hers since we didn’t have kids to quarrel over and force us back together in close quarters. Since then, my sister and I have both tried dating, but I have had far more success. She has been rather bitter about it and constantly complains how she can’t find any good men. The ones she has liked got cold feet once she finally told them about her kids. She dated one guy three weeks before revealing the truth. After the umpteenth conversation, I finally told my sister she was setting herself up for disappointment. She was lying to these men by not being truthful right off the bat. My sister snapped; she didn’t want to lead with any baggage like crazy baby mama drama. I told her she just proved her own point. She ended up kicking me out and currently isn’t talking to me. I know I was rather blunt, but she was like a dog with a bone in our conversations. Is there anything else I could have done? I love my sister but she is driving me nuts.\n\n— But the Baggage\n\nDear Baggage,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou are right about the mistake your sister is making in not disclosing the kids upfront, but you were wrong to tell her. As many times as she ranted about the same thing, she didn’t ask for advice. The next time she complains to you about something for the umpteenth time, instead of “here’s where you’re messing up,” consider “I hate this for you,” and let her figure it out in her own time.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.) Join the live chat every Monday at noon (and submit your comments) here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI was married 16 years and divorced six years ago. My ex and I became very amicable and quarantined together during COVID. Since we got along so well during the pandemic, we decided to move in together to help with finances and co-parenting our three kids. I said if we can work it out between us, that would be a bonus. So he sold his house and moved into mine. After a few months, I realized there was no spark, but I loved our relationship of friends/co-parenting. I made this clear to him multiple times when he would ask where the relationship was going. We did couples counseling and the counselor agreed that we were not at a “couples” place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast forward to now, we still live together (separate rooms), and I have moved on and found a new relationship. I never thought I’d even want to, but this snuck up on me and has been absolutely wonderful. My ex is very hurt and feels like I played him. (He has paid no rent or bills the entire Two years he’s been here by the way.) I feel guilty that he thought it would turn into more and it did not, even though I was very clear about that only being a potential bonus of the co-parenting setup. He apparently misunderstood or just thought he’d take the chance it would 100 percent workout. (We have not been intimate since before our divorce.) He is furious with me and says he will never trust me again. Why do I feel so guilty, and how do I let it go and enjoy my new relationship?\n\n— Did I Unintentionally Intentionally Hurt Him?\n\nDear Hurt Him,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I said if we can work it out between us, that would be a bonus.”\n\n“I made this clear to him multiple times when he would ask where the relationship was going.”\n\nIf these statements are true, you covered your bases and did not break his trust. I mean, I don’t think allowing someone who clearly wanted to be in a relationship with you to sell his home and move in was the best idea, but what’s done is done. Please continue with couples counseling with the goals of repairing the damage that was done during this failed experiment and figuring out a new plan for co-parenting—and one for him to move out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI (30, they/them) live in a small city that tends to lean pretty conservative, whereas my household is definitely not. Since moving into a house a few years ago, I had dreams of becoming friends (or at least being friendly, in a way that can build community for sharing resources, helping each other out, etc.) with my new neighbors … but that was quickly dashed when I realized most people directly around me are the types that either really keep to themselves or are full-blown, far-right, racist conspiracy theorists. I basically gave up on trying to go out of my way to connect with anyone around us, but over the past couple of years, I started noticing a few houses around us have yard signs indicating that the people living there are, at the very least, fairly liberal. It made me want to reach out to those people, with the hopes it would turn out better than previous attempts to meet neighbors. Easy enough, right?\n\nThe problem is, I’m not sure how best to do this! Some complicating factors include: I’m agender and use they/them pronouns, which many people struggle with/are put off by, and our household is still taking COVID seriously, so we wouldn’t be up for unmasked meetings or people randomly showing up at our door. My first instinct was to write them a letter (since we obviously would know the address) and introduce ourselves that way and include phone numbers/emails for contact, but I’m not sure what to include or if that would be weird. If I send a letter, what would I say? Should I mention why I chose them to reach out to? Do I include our pronouns? Do I mention we are still adhering to COVID precautions and wouldn’t want people showing up unannounced? And if not a letter, what would be a better option? I’m not sure what is considered “normal” for meeting neighbors, because I grew up almost exclusively in apartments, and that always felt different since we’d mostly just meet people in passing in the hallways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know I’m overthinking this all, but I would love your opinion, thoughts, scripts, or anything else you’ve got!\n\n— To Write or Not to Write\n\nDear To Write,\n\nYou’re not overthinking, but I think you’re possibly over-expecting. You absolutely deserve friendships with people who you like, who like you back, who have good politics, who have good vibes, who know it’s no big deal to use your correct pronouns and respect whatever you need to do avoid getting COVID. But to make it a goal to find these friendships in people who live in specific homes in your neighborhood is to set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nJust imagine it: “Hello I don’t know you but I like your sign and assume it reflects your politics (at least I hope so!) and would like to be friends. My pronouns are they/them and I’m avoiding COVID so I hope you’re not put off but please don’t show up unannounced or expect me to hang out indoors. Looking forward to connecting and getting to know each other — Your neighbor.” This could very well start a beautiful relationship, but it might also feel a bit … intense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should disentangle your desire to meet close, local friends who are compatible with you and share your values from your desire to know your neighbors. When it comes to the people who share your worldview and live nearby, just make it a goal to meet them. Start there. To make a connection, find something that might begin to weed out people who would have a fit over saying “they” or wearing a mask. This is what NextDoor was made for (though please note it can often also be a racist cesspool). How about a post asking for help with an effort that could attract people who tend to be compassionate and progressive? Maybe you could gather a group to support a local political candidate who aligns with your values. Or ask for donations for a shelter for LGBTQ youth, or asylum-seekers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, you know how it goes—see if you end up in a really good conversation with someone who’s dropping off a load of socks and toiletries. Exchange numbers. Arrange a coffee. Or invite a few people over for a cookout. If somewhere along the way they tell you COVID is just a flu or they can’t seem to stop calling you by the wrong pronoun, you can pull back, but you won’t have wasted your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\n“When it comes to finding likeminded people, dropping off letters is not the way to go.”\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris and friends discuss a letter in this week’s Dear Prudence Uncensored—only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a 24-year-old trans woman living with my fiancé, a 25-year-old non-binary fem. We have been together for almost six years, and we have lived together for about three and a half years after I moved to her country. We had always been incredibly in love, and they supported my transition 100 percent when I started coming out about two years ago. In the last couple of years, we’ve been having some issues (mostly around us having a hard time managing money and my partner’s depression), but we’ve always tried to work on things and work together.\n\nThey confided in me about a year ago (with a tremendous amount of guilt) that they weren’t feeling the same attraction to me as they did before I transitioned. We were still committed to working together to deal with it, and for a while it seemed like it was doing better. However, in the past couple weeks, it’s come up again when talking about getting couples therapy, and we confronted it head-on yesterday. We had a long tearful discussion; they said that, as hard as they were trying, they just didn’t feel the physical connection anymore. We had been trying out polyamory, which was working for me but they really struggled with it, and we just don’t know if this can work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re both utterly heartbroken, and it feels like the world is turning upside down. They feel horrendous and wish more than anything that they could just feel that same attraction, but they can’t (and I don’t think that’s their fault). Is there anything we can do to fix this problem? Or is this a hopeless situation? Either way, they are committed to staying together at least on paper to help me get my permanent residency so I won’t lose everything.\n\n— Absolutely Heartbroken\n\nDear Heartbroken,\n\nThis is really hard. I want to congratulate you and your fiancé on doing your best to work through the tough turn your relationship has taken and to remain supportive of each other during a difficult time. I get a lot of letters from couples in which one person’s attraction to the other has disappeared, and it’s not always handled this well.\n\nI know that doesn’t make it any less painful.\n\n“Hopeless” is harsh, but it seems likely that this relationship is coming to a natural end because of changed feelings, which is just how relationships go sometimes. After all, the two of you have left no stone unturned here. Couples therapy. An exploration of polyamory. Long and tearful discussions. Those are all the things I’d recommend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy only other suggestion is: Time. Take some—it sounds like you have to anyway due to the residency issue—before making a final decision. I noticed that you said your partner has been feeling less attracted to you since your transition but that the change also lines up with a period of time when they’ve been dealing with depression. I wonder if they are willing to hang in there a little longer to work on treating that, to see if their attraction reignites or if they feel more hopeful about exploring tweaks to your relationship when they’re in a better place. It’s worth asking, but you should also mentally prepare yourself to have to break up—hopefully amicably, because you seem to have a lot of love and respect for each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGive Prudie a Hand in “We’re Prudence”\n\nSometimes even Prudence needs a little help. This week’s tricky situation is below. Join the conversation about it on Twitter with Jenée @jdesmondharris, and then look back for the final answer here on Friday.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am a high school sophomore struggling with a friend’s sort-of-homophobia. “Ella” is straight, and I am a closeted lesbian. We became close fairly quickly at the beginning of our freshman year, but when she repeatedly asked me if I was straight, we had known each other for less than a month. It’s obvious she was trying to be “inclusive,” but all she succeeded in doing was freaking me out. I didn’t know if she was trustworthy, so I ended up lying, which I don’t regret but still feel horrible about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it was just that, I would try to let it go. The thing is, it’s not just that. Every so often, Ella will say something mildly icky about gay people. I try to push back, sometimes gently and sometimes not-so-gently. However, she always brushes me off, downplays the impact of her words, or condescendingly claims to “know” that [insert stereotype] is actually reality. Then I always end up agreeing to disagree, because going back and forth is exhausting. The constant balancing act of standing up for what’s right while making sure Ella doesn’t get suspicious is frustrating and upsetting. Ella is also incredibly boy-crazy, which means she expects me to be up for discussing both her and my crushes constantly. Thankfully, it’s gotten better since we met, especially since I started to pretend that I’m a “late bloomer” who’s just more interested in schoolwork.\n\nI hate all of this, though! I hate lying, and changing the subject, and agreeing to disagree, and feeling conflicted about a person I otherwise like and enjoy. I hate that she pretends to be tolerant when she’s one of the most narrow-minded people I’ve ever met. My only other queer friend goes to a very accepting school and has loads of accepting friends, so I have nobody in my life who understands what I’m going through. Lately, I have tried to put some distance between Ella and me, but we’re part of the same friend group at school, so I’m sort of stuck with her. What can I do? Please help!\n\n— Losing-It Lesbian\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI come in here looking for … advice? Vindication? Something in between. I broke up with my partner recently, and one of the reasons was our different outlook on what a quiet moment should sound like. They thought that unless we were actively engaged in activities (such as reading) a shared moment would necessarily include conversation. I, on the other hand, am fine with being quiet and existing in my head for a while next to someone. If there is nothing specific to talk about, is it weird that I would like quiet from time to time? To look around a place in silence? He said it was weird and shared moments include conversation, but Prudie, sometimes there is nothing to talk about, and I have no desire to talk about articles or whatever he is seeing on Twitter. Do people really just talk? That much? Sounds exhausting.\n\n— Would Like a Moment of Quiet Please\n\nDear Quiet Please,\n\nSo the two of you would just be sitting in a room together, not reading, not doing anything special, and you would not want him to talk? At all? Honestly, yes, that does strike me as weird—meaning, unusual. But that doesn’t mean it’s not valid and okay! You were right to break up with someone who was incompatible with you, and I believe there is someone else out there who will be happy hang out with you in silence (and maybe text you when he sees a good tweet—just make you sure turn your notifications off so you’re not bothered, okay?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nOver lunch the other day my brother mentioned that he had taken his 2-year-old son to buy a helmet so he can ride his tricycle outside, and that my nephew’s first choice was a yellow and pink helmet covered with cartoon flowers. My brother gently steered him toward a more “manly” helmet. This provoked a lively (amiable) discussion around the table as to whether little boys should be allowed to wear pink and flowers if they so choose. My immediate response was that they should, but I suppose I can see my brother’s point that allowing kids to wear anything they please might get them bullied. What’s your position?",

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nMy boss wants me to interview his dunce of a son for a job in my department. How can I get out of this without jeopardizing my own position?\n\n—Don’t Make Me Responsible\n\nDear Don’t Make Me,\n\nOh, you are in a pickle. If it’s any consolation, this ordeal will make you the prohibitive favorite next time you’re in a “Who Has the Best Bad Boss Story” contest.\n\nAny well-run workplace should have clear policies prohibiting nepotism. And a big enough workplace should have a human resources department that helps process job applications and ensure that the hiring process is fair and equitable. If—and it’s a big if—you are in such an organization, you could loop in HR to handle the problem since it would be squarely their responsibility. You could do that directly with your boss: “Thanks for recommending Dunce Son. Rich in HR is partnering with us on this hire, so let’s ask him to review the application materials.” Or you can do it more subtly, by forwarding the son’s resume to HR and asking them if they want to set up an interview, and acting surprised when they refuse to do so because he doesn’t meet the basic requirements listed in the job description. Even if your workplace is fine with nepotism, it should have conflict of interest policies, and your boss pushing his Dunce Son on his direct report is clearly a conflict of interest. Again, if you have a human resources department, make it their responsibility to enforce the organization’s rules.\n\nBut let’s be realistic. A lot of professions and organizations don’t have or don’t enforce basic ethical guidelines. Plus powerful people find all kinds of ways to give their kids advantages (just ask a nepo baby). Given that your boss is unethical enough to use his influence to try to get his Dunce Son an undeserved interview, he would probably use his influence to retaliate against you if you refuse. Don’t trust this guy.\n\nIt might feel like the safest, if most nauseating, option to just go through with the interview. That option avoids an immediate showdown with your boss. But you’d just be kicking the confrontation down the line. If Dunce Son doesn’t get the job, he will blame you for any real or perceived failures during the interview and urge your boss to retaliate against you, since I’m sure he learned that sort of unethical behavior at home. Worse, you might be pressured to hire him and be stuck with a Dunce Direct Report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out more about your boss and your workplace by setting some boundaries. You could agree to the interview as an exercise: “Boss, I see that Dunce Son isn’t as qualified as our other applicants and so wouldn’t get the job. Would you like him to go through an interview as practice?” Or you can tell your boss that you’ve seen the research, and it often backfires if someone gets a job at a parent’s workplace. Colleagues resent the nepo hire, and future employers assume they were unqualified for the job. If you’re feeling courageous and have the freedom to walk away from an unethical boss, you could give him a chance to do the right thing: “I appreciate you bringing Dunce Son to my attention, but I’m concerned that it would be unethical/unprofessional/disruptive/awkward/improper [take your pick] to have him report through me to you.” But keep your expectations low, and good luck finding a better boss next time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Your Questions to Good Job!\n\nLaura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI’ve been at the same job for nine years and it has a lot of positives: I feel respected, the management is mostly functional and well-intentioned, and I have a lot of freedom and autonomy with my work. However, the past year has been really difficult because I had a quiet falling out with a clique of three other women who work with me.\n\nOne of the three is someone I see frequently and am trying to maintain a cordial but distant relationship with. I have no contact with the second woman and also don’t need to work with her directly. The third is my direct supervisor, and while she is a good boss and I don’t feel like the social situation has impacted our work relationship, it’s still uncomfortable for me because we used to be significantly closer. We used to hang out outside of work occasionally. Now the situation is different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m trying really hard to be professional and keep my social life separate from work, but I can’t stop feeling like I would be better off at a different branch of the company. The issue is that this move would make my commute potentially much longer and I’d have no guarantees about management and freedom. I really do like most of my other co-workers, too. I’m worried about giving up my current position because all the other aspects of it are so good! Finding a new company is not feasible for financial/retirement reasons. Is the devil I know really better, or should I be looking at other workplaces?\n\n—Sick of the Clique But Scared of Change\n\nDear Sick of the Clique,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople spend so much time, energy, and emotion at work, and that can be treacherous—it’s one of the reasons why we started this advice column. It’s easy to make friends or romantic partners with co-workers since you spend so much time together and usually have similar backgrounds and interests. (Proximity is one of the best predictors of close relationships.) But when those relationships end, oof. Good for you for maintaining a civil relationship with the clique after your friendships broke up. You don’t say what caused the falling out, and it could have been anything. If it was because of a mistake you made, there’s still time to apologize to the two who aren’t your boss (we’ll get to your boss in a second)—not to renew the relationships, but to acknowledge your part in what went wrong and to wish them well. It’s also fine to just ignore the past closeness and treat them as you would any other colleagues. Your interactions should get less awkward with time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s talk about your boss. It’s generally fine to hang out outside of work with direct reports, but describing her group as a “clique” implies it was exclusionary. That’s a quick way to build resentment among her direct reports. After-work events shouldn’t be secret (they never stay a secret) and should be open to anyone—ideally without pressuring anyone to join in to be seen as a team player. Managing is hard!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour boss seems to be scrupulous about not letting the end of your friendship harm your work relationship. I’m sure it’s sad to lose the closeness you once had, but it sounds like you respect her for being professional and fair after the falling out. She can be a bad friend but a good boss. I don’t think it’s worth the financial risk or longer commute to change jobs just to avoid your boss, although you might want to keep an eye out for a job that would be a step up.\n\nIf the awkwardness starts to impair your performance, you could set up a meeting with your boss to clear the air. If you think you did anything wrong, you can apologize. But don’t fish for reassurance. Tell her you just wanted to say explicitly that you value your working relationship and look forward to whatever projects are coming up next. If you have an annual performance review, you could say something like this then. But friendships fade for all kinds of reasons, and maintaining a respectful working relationship will get easier as you make new friends (ideally outside of work) and any hard feelings fade. Congratulations to you for keeping the clique drama out of the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlate Plus members get more Good Job every week. Sign up now to read Laura Helmuth’s additional column this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI run a team at a small biotech company. I’ve built the team since the company was founded six years ago, so I have hired everyone directly based on what I felt was the best combination of technical skills and personality fit (especially for more junior people, they can be taught). The first two people (#1 and #2) I hired essentially started at the same time and had also known each other through other professional settings, but I had to fire #1 about one year ago due to performance (after being on a performance improvement plan and numerous other opportunities to improve before that).\n\nAbout six months before I fired #1, I hired another person (#3) at a slightly more junior level than #1 and #2 to help with an increasing workload and allow #1 and #2 to focus on new projects. After firing #1, #3 stepped in to take over #1’s project, as it was essential and they had a skill set that matched the project needs. They have performed beyond expectations and have been promoted accordingly. I also recently hired two more junior-level team members as more work kept coming and had them report to #2 to give her an opportunity to grow and gain experience managing people. Since then, #2 and #3 have not gotten along and there is a divide between #2 and her reports and #3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#3 has come to me expressing her frustration with the situation and hinting at some sort of jealousy as being the issue. In individual meetings with #2, they have expressed that #3 can seem bossy and critical of how others are working (in talking with the team I have viewed this as being a rigorous scientist). Given the size of the team, there are projects where I expect everyone to work together and I give them the freedom to determine exactly how work gets done but empower certain individuals to be the lead. But lately, people have been reluctant to work on projects with #3, and essentially work on their parts separately even though certain aspects of the project require communication and working side by side. I have had regular group and individual meetings to facilitate that collaboration but it’s not getting through. I’m not sure how to get people who don’t want to work together to do so. Any suggestions?\n\n—Desperate Director\n\nDear Desperate,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou’ve had a crash course in management challenges in just a few years—hiring, performance improvement plans, firing, and promotions. Now you’re encountering a new challenge: managing a manager. Good for you for recognizing #2’s potential and giving her a chance to manage her own team. One of #2’s responsibilities as a new manager is to help her team work well with others. It’s tempting to resolve these conflicts yourself, but ask #2 to talk through the problem and propose her own solutions. Encourage her to think of her team first—ahead of her own irritation—and tell her it’s on her to ensure her team has a professional and productive relationship with #3. Has #2 had any management training? If not, this would be a good occasion to sign her up for some primers on conflict resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis ongoing conflict is also an opportunity for #3 to learn new collaboration skills. I assume she’s your direct report, and it speaks well of your relationship with both #3 and #2 that they trust you enough to discuss their conflict. It could well be that #2 and her team are jealous of #3. That’s common enough. But #3 can also try new techniques to collaborate with people who are threatened by her scientific rigor or think she’s being bossy. It might feel less efficient, but she could ask #2 and her team for their feedback more often, follow up on their ideas, give them credit where it’s due, clarify the divisions of labor, and make it clear that she’s not disparaging them if #3 is right about something and #2 is wrong. It’s tricky—you don’t want to imply that #3 needs to hide her rigor or intelligence. But it’s a sign of rigor and intelligence when you find ways to ease difficult working relationships.\n\n—Laura\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy kids’ day care had a Halloween party where family members could come in and watch the kids do a parade around the facility in their costumes. My mother-in-law saw the sheet with the info on the counter when she was over at the house and asked about it. I said neither of us could make it and she said that maybe she and my father-in-law could go so the kids would have someone there. I told her to please not do that, the kids (or at least our daughter) would get upset seeing them but not leaving with them or having them stay and it would make the rest of the day more difficult for the teachers. She said OK and I didn’t think anything more of it.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is online weekly to chat live with readers on Mondays at noon ET. Read part 1 of the chat here. Read part 2 below.\n\nQ. Can’t Handle the Family Tension: My husband and I had our daughter a year ago. She is the light of our lives, and our parents adore her. Despite having a close relationship with my dad for 10 years before our daughter was born, my husband is suddenly cold and often rude to my dad. Whenever my dad comes over, he will often go into our bedroom. My dad is so good with our daughter and came and helped me every day for two months postpartum. Since then, he comes about once a week for a few hours; however, it tapered off due to my husband’s conduct. My husband claims that there’s no “room” for him to interact with our daughter when my dad is here, and he says he feels jealous. I’ve tried to be respectful of his perspective, but having to tiptoe around his feelings and watching him hurt my dad’s is really upsetting me.\n\nA: This is odd. I would think that a few hours of babysitting help from a grandparent would be a great time for a dad to say, “I’m so glad you interact with the baby so well! I’m going to take a nap/do some work/go to the grocery store/call a friend/[insert any number of things that are tough to do while caring for a baby].” So I don’t have a strong sense of what’s really going on here. If you don’t have a gut instinct about some specific issue either, I suggest asking your husband a few questions to get to the core of the situation. Try these:\n\n“Is there something specific my dad did that made you uncomfortable or jealous?”\n\n“Does my dad owe you an apology for anything?”\n\n“What would an ideal grandparent visit look like to you?”\n\n“Is there anything you’re worried about when it comes to your relationship with the baby?”\n\n“How are you feeling overall? About our life? About being a parent? Is it possible you’re a little depressed?”\n\n“Is there anything you would really like to change about our life as parents?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m hoping one of those will pull out some additional information that will help him to explain what’s going on so you have something concrete to address. Because without the rest of the story, his reaction to having another capable and loving set of hands around doesn’t make a lot of sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ. Distressed Dad: My wife and I have two kids: an older daughter and a younger son. When they were younger, they used to get along quite well, but now it’s been nothing but fights. I’m 1 of 3 kids, and I know, once puberty hits, the tension between kids can increase, but the conflict between my kids seems a bit extreme. My son refuses to so much as sit beside his sister at a restaurant, attributing this to her outlandish dress being embarrassing. He frequently moves as far away from her in public as possible, not even posing for a photo on vacation when his mom asks. My daughter makes endless jabs at his character, and also prefers to be photographed nowhere near him. My son will scream and yell that he “hates his sister” and wishes that “she never existed.” He also frequently suggests that she is stupid and ugly—even going so far as to make fun of her acne, which my wife and I specifically told him she was sensitive about. My daughter normally shuts down at this point and hides in her room. My wife and I can’t even leave them home alone for a date night because it usually results in one of them (my daughter, for the most part) calling to accuse her brother of physical violence against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have sat both my kids down for a chat about their poor behavior. My daughter has said she believes that her insults are “deserved” and that it’s nothing compared with what her brother does to her. My son is a bit more complicated. His sister is a very open lesbian, and he will sometimes claim that his embarrassment of her is due to her sexual orientation. My wife and I are very openly liberal, so I can’t imagine where he got this idea from, but I’m inclined to believe that her sexuality is just a quick scapegoat for him. Deep in my heart, I hope that they will both grow out of this behavior, but until then, I need advice on how to at least get them to sit down beside each other. We have a trip to Hawaii planned in a few weeks, and I know when they are older they will want pictures of themselves that don’t look miserable. How can I get them to tolerate each other?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I read this a couple of times before it really crystallized for me: You’re trying to “both sides” your son harassing and physically assaulting your queer daughter. Stop doing that. This isn’t a tale of sibling rivalry, it’s not an even fight (I don’t care that your son is younger), and it’s not behavior that they both need to grow out of. It’s behavior that your son needs to stop. Of course your daughter attacks his character. He’s antagonizing her based on her appearance and sexual orientation to such an extent that she has to hide from him. That is a character that deserves an attack!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address this, you need to change your goal from taking nice photos to having a happy family and letting your daughter live in peace. Your son sounds like a kid who is unhappy and needs help, and I believe that his cruel and homophobic treatment of his sister is a manifestation of a deeper problem. You owe it to your daughter to shut down any comments he makes and to protect her from him, but you also owe it to him to figure out why he’s like this, heal the underlying issue (therapy for him! Family therapy for all!), and also give him the skills to move through the world without turning his pain and distress into bullying. This starts by letting him know you’re a parent who cares more about having children who are healthy, are happy, and treat each other well than about getting the perfect vacation picture.\n\nQ. Step, Not Sister: My dad married my stepmom 20 years ago, when I was 8 and my stepsister, Jane, was 11. My mom had primary custody, so I lived with Jane only on weekends, but we had a fine-enough relationship (different interests, but she was always nice to me) until she went to college 500 miles away and we saw each other mostly on holidays. Recently, she moved back to our hometown, we see each other occasionally, and I’ve noticed something that bothers me: When we meet each other’s acquaintances, she always introduces me as her sister. Not “step,” just “sister.” I don’t feel as if she’s my sister! I feel much closer to my half siblings on my mom’s side, with whom I actually share blood and live five days a week. Jane and I were more like pleasant roommates, and I’m frankly surprised she feels compelled to call me a sibling. At any rate, when Jane tells someone, “This is my sister,” it really bothers me. But I can’t think of a way to correct her, on the spot or privately, that doesn’t get terribly awkward. Do you have any ideas?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think you should just be OK with being introduced to people you don’t know well as her sister. If it’s someone you’re meeting in passing, who cares? And if you do become close enough and develop an actual relationship, there will be plenty of opportunities to mention something like, “I was a flower girl when my dad married Jane’s mom when I was 8.”\n\nQ. Yes or No: I went through a breakup and am getting back into dating. I’ve been finding it very stressful in general and want to have fun instead. I’m a woman, my previous partner is a man, and the most promising dates I’ve been on have been with a man who seems to have lots of green flags and be kind. I’m just not sure how much we connect but am open to finding out. I want to explore my sexuality, though, and go on some dates with people who aren’t men. I recently got a message from a woman on an app suggesting a one-night stand. This could be a good opportunity to explore my sexuality, but for some reason the idea of pursuing that is really scary to me. I’ve been trying to think of why that is, as long as safety measures are taken), but I’m not sure where the fear is coming from. I don’t want to have regrets, but something is making me hesitate to say yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I’m torn between telling you to listen to your instincts, which I think can be very important, and questioning whether your “fear” is just internalized biphobia bubbling up. Still, I think you should skip this date, just because being scared is no way to go into a romantic situation. The way you’re feeling could be telling you that this woman is a bad fit, or that you aren’t ready. And even if it means nothing or comes from unconscious misguided beliefs about same-sex relationships being bad, it’s not fair to her to go into getting to know each other with your defenses up. Pass for now, and wait until there’s an opportunity that makes you feel mostly excited and positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ. Template-less: I’m in my mid-20s and found out last week that I am autistic. This is a joyful discovery for me; I feel I finally have the right words to describe my experience. One of the major symptoms I’ve experienced is trouble maintaining relationships. I hate talking on the phone and don’t have the bandwidth to reply to frequent emails or texts. I’ve lost relationships due to this: I’m functionally estranged from several relatives and no longer in contact with my oldest friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am wondering if “coming out” as autistic would help heal the hurt of people who feel I’ve abandoned them, and possibly allow me to have renewed and more sustainable relationships with them. Do you have any suggestions for thinking this through, or for how I might go about doing this?\n\nA: Remember that many friendships and relationships fade out over the years. Don’t assume that any time this happened in your life it was the result of your diagnosis. But if there are people who you know were hurt by your failure to keep in touch and—this part is key—you think you would like to reestablish some kind of connection with now, definitely reach out and explain your new insight. Include a plan for what you’d like things to look like in the future: Can they expect one text and a holiday card a year from you? Will you eventually pick up if they call you repeatedly? Do you do better keeping in touch about a shared interest? Whatever it is, let them know so you don’t set yourself up to feel guilty for falling out of touch again.\n\nRe: Q. Can’t Handle the Family Tension: What was your husband’s relationship like with his own father? When he talks about being “jealous,” it could be that seeing a grandfather lavish love on a child brings up longing for his own childhood—sorrow that he did not get that kind of love from his father (or grandfather). It can be bittersweet. Of course, this needs to be dealt with more constructively, but I do think exploring whether he has some grief is worth it.\n\nA: I didn’t even think of the jealousy possibly flowing in that direction. Great insight.\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: Thanks, everyone!

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAfter the Trump administration rounded up hundreds of Venezuelan migrants around the country—without notice or court hearings—and sent them off to a prison in El Salvador, we’re finally getting details on who was deported and why. And the more we learn, the more obvious it becomes why the government is so eager to expel these individuals without any semblance of due process. It claims that these men are terrorists by virtue of their alleged membership in the Tren de Aragua gang—but evidence of this affiliation is weak to the point of nonexistence.\n\nConsider Jerce Reyes Barrios, one victim of the deportations: a professional soccer player who had fled Venezuela after protesting against dictator Nicolás Maduro and was living peacefully in the U.S. until the government snatched him up and deported him to El Salvador. Linette Tobin, Barrios’ attorney, submitted a declaration in federal court that detailed the disturbing reasons why her client was targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After entering the U.S. last year, Barrios was scheduled to have an asylum hearing in April. But on Saturday, he was arrested and held at a San Diego detention facility after ICE agents accused him of being a member of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that President Donald Trump has been fixated on to fulfill his mass-deportation plan.\n\nICE’s accusations were based on two things. First, Barrios has a tattoo on his arm of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball that, federal immigration authorities allege, “is proof of gang membership.” In reality, Tobin wrote, the tattoo was inspired by the Real Madrid soccer team, which is also circular in shape and features a crown. Second, Barrios posted a photo of himself on social media in which he’s gesturing with both hands, with his middle fingers down. This, federal agents claimed, was also proof of gang membership—except that Barrios’ hand gesture actually means “I love you” in sign language and is also commonly used as a symbol of rock ’n’ roll.\n\nThis implausible misinterpretation of benign tattoos is a common theme across migrants caught up in this unlawful scheme. ICE alleged that another individual, known as E.V., was a member of Tren de Aragua based on his tattoos—which feature “anime, flowers, and animals,” as well as a crown of thorns. Agents reportedly believed that the crown indicates gang membership. But as his lawyer explained, it is in fact “a tribute to his grandmother,” whose “date of death appears at the base of the crown.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate The Trump Administration Is Invoking an Obscure Law That Makes Very Little Sense in 2025 Read More\n\nOthers faced similarly baseless accusations. One migrant, known as J.A.B.V., has tattoos of “a Rose, a Clock and a Crown with his son’s name on it,” none of which indicates gang membership. Like many of these men, he has never been arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime in Venezuela or the United States. But ICE agents said that tattoos were proof of Tren de Aragua membership and deported him. Another migrant, L.G., “has three tattoos: one is a rosary, the other is his partner’s name, and the third is a rose and a clock.” None have any connection to a gang, but ICE accused him of gang membership anyway. It made the same claim about Anyelo Jose Sarabia because he has tattoos of a Bible verse and a rose with money as petals. And about Franco Caraballo because of a tattoo celebrating his daughter. The list goes on.\n\nAdding insult to injury, many of these migrants came to the U.S. seeking refuge from Tren de Aragua, only to then be accused of membership in that very gang. One person, whose name was redacted, had applied for asylum six months before being unlawfully deported this month “due to my fear of harm and mistreatment from multiple criminal groups, including the Tren de Aragua gang,” according to his attorney’s declaration. Immigration agents detained him while he was living in a New York homeless shelter with his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government’s theory appears to be that any Venezuelan migrant with tattoos is presumptively a member of Tren de Aragua until proven otherwise—except that they cannot prove otherwise, since they have been denied due process. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 precisely because, he claims, it allows him to expel noncitizens without the annoyance of judicial oversight. That is wrong, but the Justice Department is hoping to get around that problem by moving so quickly that courts can’t keep up. And when courts have tried to intervene, the DOJ claims that Trump’s decisions are unreviewable, rejecting the judiciary’s authority to limit the president’s lawbreaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese false accusations are not novel: During Trump’s first term, ICE routinely accused noncitizens of gang membership based on their tattoos and tried to deport them on that basis. One federal judge even accused ICE agents of lying under oath about the tattoos of a man with DACA status, freeing him from illegal detention. From that incident, the new administration seems to have learned an important lesson: When granted due process in a court of law, noncitizens might actually be able to disprove the bogus allegations against them. And in response, the government has developed new legal theories designed to prevent judges from seeing, let alone ruling upon, the evidence that ICE has concocted to justify their deportation.\n\nIt’s an open question whether ICE targeted these men because of their tattoos or whether agents detained them first, then fabricated a pretext later. Those details will hopefully be sorted out when lawyers for the victims can interrogate those who perpetrated this scheme. What matters most now is that judges have an opportunity to review the alleged evidence, in conjunction with the relevant law, and end this persecution before its test run is expanded into a full-blown suspension of all immigrants’ constitutional rights.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy girlfriend and I are arguing about what being supportive of one another looks like. It started with her participating in Dry January and me deciding not to. Neither of us drinks that much, I didn’t feel the need to examine my relationship with alcohol or feel the effects of abstaining from it as I have unconsciously gone more than a month without drinking alcohol before. Even though I morally supported her, I did not go out of my way to shield her from alcohol (she is not going through an addiction recovery program after all—she is a 33-year-old challenging herself).\n\nThe whole month she would get upset if I had a glass of wine with dinner or wanted to go to lunch at our favorite brewery, which has a lot of nonalcoholic options and which she typically doesn’t even order alcoholic drinks when we go. Even me choosing brunch at the place with the “best Blood Mary in town” (her words) was seen as me not being supportive.\n\nIt has now evolved into me not supporting her fitness journey because I won’t participate in the things she does or diet. I don’t believe in diets. I was a wrestler in my youth and had a messed up relationship with food. I have since learned to eat and exercise in moderation and to enjoy both things. I support her goals—I encourage her, ask her about how her training is going, or how she’s liking various exercise classes or strength training sessions but I don’t want to join her in them. Apparently, by not wanting to go on a strenuous hike on a Sunday afternoon I’m being unsupportive. I was fine going on an easy to moderate hike but she wants to turn everything into a workout. I picked up Chipotle for us the other day and got her the healthy bowl option that she wanted but I was being “unsupportive” because I got my usual with extra guac and sour cream.\n\nWhen I ask her what supporting her looks like, she says it is me being a part of the things she likes. But what if I don’t want to go to a hot yoga class (why is all yoga heated these days?!), or if I’d rather read a book than go on a walk after dinner every evening? How can I explain to her that being supportive doesn’t actually mean participating?\n\n—I Like My Guac…\n\nDear Guac,\n\nI don’t like the sound of this. It seems to me that your girlfriend is confusing “being supportive” with “adjusting your behaviors to match mine exactly.” That’s a pretty controlling mindset. If she’s unable to tolerate your status as an independent person who is allowed to make lifestyle choices that are different from hers—and if she treats every one of your aberrant choices as a direct affront to hers—then I’m not sure there’s much of a future in this relationship.\n\nTell your girlfriend that if she needs a partner whose lifestyle will match hers exactly, she may have to start looking for a new partner. A healthy relationship often pushes us to change our habits, but the desire has to be mutual, and these expectations still need to take everyone’s preferences and sensitivities into consideration. One person does not get to call all of the shots; in this situation, being accused of being “unsupportive” sounds a lot more like you’re being accused of being “disobedient.”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy aunt is a doctor. I recently learned that before we were together, my fiancé incessantly messaged her office and wrote negative reviews, all because it didn’t support a therapy that very few doctors support—although apparently specialists to whom my aunt has referred people for other issues do support the therapy in question, which seems to be why my fiancé thought he could get things changed.",

        "content": "Good Job is Slate’s advice column on work. Have a workplace problem big or small? Send it to Laura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI’m applying for traditional employment after being self-employed for over seven years. I’m very proud of my company and I have many ways of positioning my work, the results I’ve achieved, and my client feedback. However, without getting into too much detail, I don’t think only listing this one role is enough for a compelling resume.\n\nThe major problem is how my last job in 2018 ended. I was wearing 10 different hats at a small consulting firm for an erratic boss. It was just me and him in the office because the rest of our team was installed in offices across the country. I briefly met or emailed with our staff and clients but never developed relationships with any of them. My boss, the owner of the company, suffered an apparent mental breakdown in my last few months with the company.\n\nHe spent hours in my office each morning talking to me about his personal life as if I were his therapist, and then would take calls to his actual therapist, his life coach, his business coach, his divorce lawyer, etc. while he paced around in the office common space ALL day long. When I put in my notice, I told him I was simply ready to relocate to the next town over and therefore wanted to start my freelance career—no hard feelings. He seemed really happy for me and understood, but then I didn’t see him for my entire notice period.\n\nWe agreed I would train my replacement, but one day, I was suddenly locked out of all my company resources. He didn’t respond to my calls and emails to figure out what was up or to get my last paycheck (which I would have had to process myself!). I was so exhausted from his antics and had freelance work stacking up, so I gave up and kept my laptop instead of pursuing my final check. My boss started calling me a week later asking why I wasn’t showing up to the office as if he had forgotten that I quit. I never returned his call.\n\nI’m hoping most jobs won’t bother to check references or past work, but it’s hard to imagine they’ll just take my word for all the work I’ve done in my career. And there is some very key technical experience I developed at the firm that I want to share in my resume. If I’m asked why I can’t provide a contact for my most recent supervisor, I have no idea what to say! The whole situation was so messy and really centered on my boss’s mental health struggles and inappropriate behavior. Can you give me some ideas for navigating this situation if it comes up?\n\n—Sketchy Work History\n\nDear Sketchy Work History,\n\nWhat a nightmare. I’m sorry your former boss made his personal life your problem, and then treated you that way after you quit.\n\nNow that you’re ready to go back onto the job market, I would keep two things in mind. One, your new job might not check references. But, if they do, I wonder if you’ve considered reaching back out to this boss. It’s been seven years, after all. Hopefully, this period in his life was a blip and he has gotten the help he needed and would be open to being a reference for you. (It’s possible he’s embarrassed about how he treated you during those last few months, too—and would welcome an opportunity to make amends.) However, proceed with caution—if you get the sense that he is still behaving erratically or harboring any resentment toward you, back off.\n\nIf the former boss is a non-starter, you could reach out to some of your former colleagues and ask if they would be willing to have a quick call with you. I know you said you weren’t close, but if you explain the situation with your former boss in broad strokes, hopefully at least one of them would be willing to be a reference for you. But don’t discount a reference from a trusted client you’ve worked with during your freelancing stint. They can speak to your work over the past seven years, and share what you’ve been up to recently—much better than your former boss can. Good luck out there on the job market!\n\n—Doree\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI don’t have kids but a number of my peers now have babies and toddlers, which means I’ve heard an awful lot of my smart, articulate friends talking about themselves in the third person, like Elmo.",

        "content": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nI’m a 28-year-old gay man, and for the past 10 years, I’ve had this arrangement with my straight friend, “Max.”\n\nIt’s simple: I perform oral on him, and that’s it. There’s no reciprocation, and we never talk about it afterward. In the beginning, Max was pretty strict about not letting me touch him during, but over time, he’s relaxed a bit. It’s always been his rules, and I’ve been fine with that.\n\nFor years, this arrangement worked perfectly for both of us. Max got what he needed, and I was happy to provide it. It became a routine—something we both understood and never questioned. But things got complicated a few months ago when I started dating John. Max found out and told me he was grossed out by the idea of me being sexually active with both him and John. He said we had to stop. Then I shocked myself when I ended up choosing Max over John. I broke up with John so Max and I could keep our arrangement going.\n\nI didn’t think Max would react the way he did. He seemed shocked and even guilty that I’d chosen him over John. Honestly, I didn’t do it to make him feel bad; I just didn’t want to lose what we had. But now, things feel different. John sent Max some angry messages, blaming him for ruining our relationship and calling him selfish. Max’s been acting weird ever since, like he’s questioning whether we should keep doing this.\n\nI don’t know what to think. On one hand, I don’t want Max to feel guilty or pressured. On the other, I made my choice, and it wasn’t just about him. But now, with all this tension, I’m starting to wonder if maybe John was right. Maybe this arrangement is holding me back. I just don’t know if I’m ready to let go of something that’s been such a big part of my life for so long. I miss John, but if I have to give up Max to have him, I know I’ll resent him.\n\n—Blew It\n\nGet sex advice—submit a question!

My interpretation of Max’s current behavior is that it probably has less to do with John, although that probably compounded things, and more to do with the fact that the situation is now completely different than it used to be. This was once something they didn’t have to talk or think too much about.\n\nAnd my gay philosophy with men with whom you are engaged in a casual relationship is don’t make them think. If you want to keep the good thing you have going, then just don’t force them them to talk about sex. Don’t make them think about sex. Just have the sex be matter of fact, and leave it at that. My guess is that for Max, things got too real.\n\nJessica Stoya: I don’t quite understand why our writer would resent John when Max is the person who gave the ultimatum.\n\nRich: Right? We don’t know how John feels about it. Max is grossed out, but John being another presumably queer man is probably used to all sorts of arrangements. Now, some people like to have a period of monogamy before they transition into nonmonogamy if they go that way, but it’s not at all mandatory. So, I think that’s a great question.\n\nWhen it comes to the relationship between Max and the letter writer, there are a few ways to interpret it. One way is that the LW is being held back by this relationship. With this “relationship” with Max, he’s effectively renting a couch forever as opposed to ever needing to buy one. But I think that there’s also an argument that this is our writer’s sexuality. I think there’s a strong argument that this is just some people’s sexuality and the whole point is to not really bond in a traditional way. The sex is the relationship.\n\nSo, I don’t want to yuck his yum or put down that kind of structure. But it’s non-normative—it’s not going to be something that you easily encounter in life or attain through traditional channels. Maybe he is being held back, but this could also just be his reality.\n\nJessica: Is Max also not being sexually active with other people? Or, is it OK for Max, but not OK for the writer? And if Max is being sexually active with other people, it seems pretty likely that at some point, he would meet someone he wants to be monogamous with. So, I would caution our writer against assuming that this dynamic, which he describes as being such a big part of his life for so long, will continue forever.\n\nRich: Right. There’s a chance that the issue has never come up for him, and now it has because it was presented to him. There’s also a chance that this dynamic is very important to Max, but perhaps he’s just not quite developed in his ability to express or process it. I think you bring up the point that they effectively have been monogamous and committed to each other. Unless Max is holding the LW to a double standard. And that would make sense too, given the stigma on gay sexuality. The thinking being: “I’m straight and I can go out and have sex with women. And that’s ‘normal,’ and doesn’t put anybody at risk. But you’re going out and having deviant gay sex, which is putting me and my partners at risk.” That kind of selective thinking is popular, especially with people who don’t want to face the full truth of their situation.\n\nJessica: That kind of thinking is definitely driven by stigma. Except on the very off chance that Max has some germophobia, in which case, that’s a separate issue. We have so much information and still so many questions.\n\nRich: Exactly. Another one being the implication is that this has been a 10-year committed relationship. Is the implication that this is the first person our writer has dated, now he’s 28, and this blowjob relationship has been taking up 10 years of the time that he would’ve spent dating? In that case, consider yourself. Maybe this is your sexuality, maybe this is who you are. Maybe traditional relationships are just not built for you. And maybe you’re in love with Max, who probably will never love you back the way that you want to be loved, but perhaps not. Maybe if nothing ever happened this could have been a thing that just lasted forever and this is what they did and they never had other official partners.\n\nJessica: One more possibility that’s occurring to me, is that Max just assumed our writer does want some kind of reciprocal, public relationship, and this situation with John may have caused Max to consider, “Is that something I can ever give the letter writer? No.” It would be a very human and kind, although slightly misguided, thing to look at someone you’re hooking up with and go, “I’m not interested in giving them the whole package, and they want the whole package. And here is this person in their life who’s willing to give them the whole package. So, I now feel like I ought to withdraw.”\n\nObviously, if that’s the case, Max did this really poorly. You don’t lead with, “I’m grossed out.” You lead with, “This person seems like they can give you something I think you want, that I can’t give you.” I think it’s really important for our writer to sit down and think not about what feels possible right now, but what they actually want. Do they want a boyfriend? Do they want, like you’ve mentioned, to give straight men blowjobs? What do they want?\n\nThen, once they have a sense of that, it’ll help them guide their choices. If he decides that he does want to hold onto this thing with Max for as long as possible, he can say to Max, “Hey, just in case you’ve got assumptions in your head about what I want or what’s best for me, let’s talk.” Maybe having one more talk is the thing that destroys the situation. But I feel like there’s as much of a chance that having one more talk saying, “Look, this is actually what I really want,” could help Max untwist himself.\n\nRich: I would say that’s a Hail Mary, but is probably what needs to happen to move forward either way. Whatever decision they both come to will help our writer move forward.\n\nThere’s a possibility that Max has assessed his situation and has thought, “What am I doing? This guy’s been sucking my dick for 10 years. This is the most committed relationship I’ve ever had in my life. I’m weirded out by this. I need an out.” And then a boyfriend comes along and that’s his out, but it didn’t really work.\n\nSo, keep in mind that there may be some other kind of inner emotions at play with Max, but I totally agree that a defining conversation, however it lands, is absolutely necessary in order for our writer to get the closure that he needs to either go out and meet another John or meet another straight guy that he can do this with. That will be a tough relationship to cultivate, but it is certainly possible.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI’m a straight man in my late 30s, and my wife of 10 years recently came out as bisexual. She says that nothing about herself has changed, she’s just acknowledging an attraction to women that’s always been there, and that our relationship will stay entirely the same, which is mostly great! The thing is, part of me WANTS a change.",

It’s probably not clinical, but she hangs onto stuff to the point where upper administration has gotten involved to make her clean her office.\n\nNow that she’s performing archaeology and sifting through multiple years of paperwork, she’s finding tons of things that she says could be useful to me. I can’t disagree in principle: She did my job before being promoted to manager, so this is probably stuff that I could use for programming. But the problem is three-fold: it’s all VERY dated, I really prefer to find my own projects, and she keeps pulling me away from my actual work to look at craft supplies from the Bush/Cheney administration. Is there a way to shut this down with minimal drama, or should I just take the stuff and store it in the circular file?\n\n—Trashing “Treasures”\n\nDear Treasures,\n\nHoarding can be a problem for people in any type of profession, but it must be even more fraught for your boss. In addition to the usual motivations for hoarding, she may feel that keeping this material somehow fits the library’s mission of preserving and sharing information. Is there any chance some of her old stuff could be of interest to a local historical society? Or a library sciences or anthropology department at a local college? Researchers might find her materials useful for understanding how library programming has evolved over the past few decades, especially with libraries and librarians under attack from the reactionary right. (I hope you and your colleagues are OK? Thank you for working in your library. We love you.) You could encourage her to ask around and donate her materials elsewhere where it can be of better use to the public than just collecting dust in a cabinet.\n\nI’m guessing nobody else wants her old stuff, though. In that case, you’ll have to be direct with your boss but compassionate, recognizing that she seems anxious about letting go. Tell her you appreciate her long view and experience, and praise the programming she did in the past. Tell her you have learned a lot from her about how to keep programming fresh, and that you want to build on what she did by developing your own new materials. If she keeps interrupting your work to show you treasures, practice ending the conversation with polite please-go-away language: “Thanks for sharing this, but now I have to finish X project.” Or, “Good to see you, thanks!” and then turn around toward your desk. She might feel guilty and anxious about throwing her old materials away. If you think it would help her make a decision (which is not your job), you could affirm that it’s right to let go: “I think it’s safe to recycle these materials now.”\n\n—Laura\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI am the mother to two wonderful children, ages 8 and 1, and my husband and I have been married for 11 years.

Held annually online, it pits hundreds of thousands of our nation’s cats and dogs against each other in a battle for votes, with winners receiving hefty cash payouts and coveted magazine spreads. It’s intended to be a sweet tournament for pet lovers, and proceeds are donated to charity. But beneath the surface, a controversy is brewing.\n\nYou can see it on one of the Facebook pages for the contest, where hundreds of posts beseech voters to cast a ballot for doe-eyed cats and tongue-lolling dogs. One of these, Shay, is an olive-eyed black feline who also happens to be a double amputee. He seems to have been put on this earth to garner sympathy: He’s a therapy cat, and his owner runs a veteran’s mental health center in Florida. “Two days left to get our favorite bipod up to first!” she wrote in a post. “Shay could definitely use your help.”\n\nHowever, nestled alongside Shay and the countless other hopeful pets—maimed or otherwise—is a subset of people who have made America’s Favorite Pet their mortal enemy. They pen ferocious takedowns, accusing the competition of being an elaborate scam and, furthermore, anyone participating in it of being a hopeless rube. There is no fury like a dog person scorned or, even worse, a cat person scorned. A confrontation was inevitable.\n\n“The rules [of the tournament] are garbage,” wrote one user on the AFP Facebook page, whose shih tzu serves as her profile photo. “How they play emotions with owners and pets.”\n\nAdded another: “I am done with all of this. … This is a scam.”\n\nIt goes on like this: threads upon threads, splintered into unremitting debate, never to be resolved. America’s Favorite Pet seems to drive people crazy—that’s why there are dozens of aggravated Reddit threads and Facebook posts that highlight its social engineering tactics and alleged wrongdoing. In fact, simply Googling “America’s Favorite Pet” leads to a suspicious number of scam-scented first-page results. The top autofill question is about whether the contest is “legitimate,” while subsequent results include multiple posts about the competition on the subreddit r/scams. (In one, someone declares the competition to be an “illegal lottery.”) And yet, it’s undeniable that the tournament does a lot of good for animals; last year’s competition raised over $8 million for PAWS, a nonprofit that rehabilitates and rehomes thousands of neglected pets. (Here’s the giant novelty check to prove it.) So, then, why are pet owners so pissed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ire starts to make sense once you understand how the competition works. America’s Favorite Pet is a charity drive run by Colossal Impact, a fundraising company designed to generate small donations from individuals, rather than corporations. (Colossal also runs tournaments like Super Mom, Bar Boss, and the Greatest Baker, all of which have the same basic game plan.) As you have likely inferred by now, America’s Favorite Pet sets out to crown a single dog and a single cat with its namesake title. The way to accomplish that is simple—the pet that receives the most votes over several rounds of competition, American Idol–style, takes home the top prize. There’s a lot on the line: The winners receive $10,000, and their pet will christen the cover of either Modern Cat or Modern Dog magazine.\n\nOwners can’t back their own pets, but everyone else can, and contestants get ahead by canvassing their personal relationships—friends, family, co-workers—to cram the ballot box. This isn’t exactly cheap. The first vote cast for a pet is free, but after that, you’re expected to fork over some money. A bundle of 10 votes requires a $10 donation, 25 votes is tied to a $25 fee, and so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, things get more muddled when you survey Colossal’s competitive structure. In essence, participants in America’s Favorite Pet aren’t facing off against the field as a whole. Instead, they’re pared down into randomly assorted bands of rival cats and dogs, groups they need to conquer before moving into the next tier of the tournament. (There are nine rounds in total.) This is stated clearly on AFP’s website: “Upon entry, competitors will be divided into groups. … Subsequent public voting rounds will progressively reduce the number of competitors.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherein lies the problem. Some of the owners who get involved in America’s Favorite Pet allege that its structure obfuscates—and perhaps embellishes—how well their animals are actually performing. Kelly Zelna, who is from Michigan and owns a tuxedo cat named Richard, is one of them. Shortly after signing up her pet for the tournament, Zelna checked his status on the AFP website. To her surprise, Richard was in first place in his group. Zelna took that messaging to mean that her cat was in pole position to secure the magazine cover, and the $10,000 prize. That would have come in handy—Richard suffers from a feline cardiological condition called HCM, and Zelna says she drops $500 at each of his many vet appointments. “All of my friends and family were really excited about it,” she told me. “We all thought he really stood a chance to win.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, once Zelna made her way to the America’s Favorite Pet Facebook page, she learned that dozens of other owners were reporting similar stories. Their cats and dogs were also in first place, because—again—each of them was in first place in their group. Naturally, Zelna wanted to know how many groups there were. But Colossal doesn’t disclose that information on the AFP website. In fact, the only way you can even find Richard’s page in the tournament is by following a link shared directly by Zelna. When I asked a Colossal spokesperson about this, they told me that although the full breadth of competitors isn’t available on the tournament page during its early stages, they’d happily send out the details to anyone who emailed the company’s support team. I requested that information and learned that the 2025 edition of America’s Favorite Pet launched with 2,352 cat groups and 3,136 dog groups. This meant that Richard was one of more than 2,000 cats who were technically in first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter considering those factors, Zelna began to feel ripped off. “There were so many different people posting, ‘This is where my cat is in this group.’ And I was like, How many groups can there be?” she said. “The contest runs for way too long, so you have to hound your family and friends for months to get votes. I think they keep us in the dark to make everyone feel like they have a shot and keep paying for votes.” (Again, she’s not the only one who feels this way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI must reiterate that the contest rules—circuitous as they may be—are printed on the AFP website for anyone to see. But it’s also fair to say that Colossal goes to considerable lengths to keep its competitors engaged in the grind. Suzanne Gauthier, a psych nurse from Massachusetts, has a pouty French bulldog named Chewbacca. She entered him in America’s Favorite Pet in hopes of using the money to help with a down payment on a new house after a fire destroyed her apartment. Gauthier actually made it through a few rounds of competition, and along the way, she received messages from the tournament encouraging her to redouble her efforts and score him more votes. She shared some of them with me; all have the grating tone of a spammy banner ad.\n\n“Urgent: It’s now or never! Voting closes at 7pm PST SHARP. Share Chewbacca’s link before it’s too late,” reads one. “Modern Dog cover are so close, Chewbacca can smell it!” says another.\n\n“Chewbacca is this close to 10k,” announces a final message, which features a pinching-hand emoji, suggesting that Gauthier is inches away from a tremendous windfall.\n\nWhat was stranger were the texts announcing to Gauthier that, for short windows of time, donors could purchase votes for Chewbacca on a 2-to-1 ratio—meaning that $10 would be converted into 20 total votes. Gauthier took advantage of that promotion in an underhanded way. She managed to buy her dog a hundred bucks’ worth of votes, breaking the cardinal rule that owners can’t back their own quadrupeds. “I was like, I’m going to hell for this,” she said, laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Chewbacca came up short. As did Richard. Nobody should be surprised. There are a ton of animals in the competition, and a few of the previous winners command sizable digital empires that civilian pets struggle to compete with. For instance: In 2024 a cat named Ysera won the contest. As of this writing, her owner has 778,000 TikTok followers. (Ysera suffered from a neurodegenerative disease and died earlier this year.)\n\nFor what it’s worth, Colossal is unapologetic about all of this. When I reached out for an interview, not only did the company enthusiastically agree to talk to me; they also sent over a glowing feature published by a website called Grit Daily that articulated its mission statement. “People love a challenge. They crave competition, rewards, and the thrill of being part of something bigger,” the article argues. “Gamification taps into that, turning donations into interactive, engaging moments rather than passive transactions.”\n\nIn that sense, despite the many accusations otherwise, Colossal doesn’t appear to be scamming anyone—it has simply translated the tenets of digital hustle culture into a fundraising drive. To succeed, one must cultivate a personal brand, draft in the algorithm, and do their very best to go viral. And, yes, as a for-profit company, it does make money off this: A spokesperson for Colossal clarified that the company retains 36.5 percent of the donations for “competition fees,” as well as up to 13.5 percent for “processing fees,” “prize costs,” and other clerical expenses, all of which are clearly included on the America’s Favorite Pet site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScaachi Koul, a senior writer at Slate who hosts the podcast Scamfluencers and is an expert auditor of swindling techniques, agrees that although that is a pretty penny for Colossal to take home, none of this reads as a hustle. “It seems to be that America’s Favorite Pet can decide what the rules are and what they’re not,” she told me. “This isn’t an election. This isn’t financial law. This is a completely arbitrary set of rules about a cat contest.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what does Colossal CEO Mary Hagen make of all those people calling her a con artist? “We call them non-winners,” she said. “We had 400,000 people sign up for America’s Favorite Pet [in 2025,] and we strategically put out the messaging and the information they need, including the competition schedule, and rules, and rounds very early on. But the reality is that not all 400,000 people open my email. We don’t want people to be confused, but more often than not, when I track down something like that, we find that that individual never accessed their dashboard, never opened an email from us. I’m not sure how to solve that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis touches on what Koul sees as the bigger issue here: the pet owners themselves, and what they’re really expecting out of this competition. “What [AFP] is doing is trying to get people to buy more stuff from them,” she said. “The point isn’t to decide what cat is cutest. The point is to get you to give them money for an organization so that more cats don’t die.” To her, the inability of pet owners to understand that they are involved in a mercurial popularity contest unbound by any objective measurements is “much more concerning than any nebulousness around where the money is going.”\n\nIn other words, the reason the contest has run into controversy is because a certain division of pet owners are completely out of their mind. They have signed up for a contest that, by its nature, will eventually inform them that they do not, in fact, own America’s Favorite Pet. That information can be psychologically displacing and can quickly lead to conspiratorial thinking. “It’s a scam! Bentley was in first for months until we stopped donating,” wrote one aggrieved owner, clearly reeling from their defeat. “You have no idea how many votes each dog has. … They take in millions.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, that is the point. America’s Favorite Pet does take in millions, and it is just one of the many different tournaments Colossal runs. Last year, it hosted Baby of the Year, a competition that raised a mammoth $22 million for Jessica Alba’s Baby2Baby charity, which distributes basic hygiene items to mothers and children in disadvantaged circumstances. Currently, Colossal is in the midst of the 2025 edition of America’s Favorite Teacher. The winner will receive $25,000, a trip to Hawaii, and a feature in Reader’s Digest. Hopeful educators are already jockeying in Facebook groups, hoping to crest the tops of their respective groups. Meanwhile, on Reddit, others assert that the whole thing is a racket. These accusations will likely follow Colossal for as long as it’s running tournaments.\n\nMeanwhile, Shay remains in contention to become America’s Favorite Pet for 2025. The winners of the contest will be revealed on Friday. Who knows? Maybe that double-amputee feline is about to be $10,000 richer. Despite everything else, that counts as a happy ending.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband and I have been happily married for almost 50 years. We have four children and gave them the most stable, loving, idyllic childhood imaginable. I had my career but worked from home to more fully devote myself to them and our household. We were always happy and we’re still close, but none of them seem to want to pass that happiness on to a new generation.\n\nMy 46-year-old son is a devastatingly handsome man with a brilliant career, but I wasn’t at all surprised when he recently revealed he had a vasectomy in his 20s; otherwise, he would have left behind a string of illegitimate pregnancies. He has never been married, simply trades his much younger girlfriends in every few years like cars. My 44-year-old daughter also has a fantastic career but has never been interested in marriage or children. My 42-year-old daughter claimed she wanted a family, but only ever picked terrible, glamorous but unfaithful men; the last one just left her after stringing her along until her biological clock ran out. My 38-year-old son is gay and completely uninterested in settling down, much less having a family. I love each of them with all my heart. But my heart breaks with the knowledge that I will almost certainly never have a grandchild.\n\nIn contrast, take my younger half-sister. She’s been married and divorced three times and has had countless shorter-term relationships. The legal father of her only daughter demanded a paternity test, abandoned their then 6-year-old daughter when she turned out not to be biologically his, and when ordered to pay child support anyway, moved overseas to avoid it. She then proceeded to drag my niece through hell, forcing her to swap homes and father figures almost yearly, to live with an older stepbrother who assaulted her, and a religious fanatic who beat both of them. And guess what? My niece married a wonderful, well-off young man at 26, and now at 28 is expecting her first child. My sister, despite having saved nowhere near enough to support herself, is planning to retire early and move in with her to help care for the baby. And they say they want three to five children!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven’t said anything about my feelings to anyone but my husband, and I don’t plan to. But emotionally I’m struggling to accept how my sister can be forgiven for being a barely adequate mother, setting a dreadful example of marriage, and still become a grandmother, while we can do everything right, give our children the world, and not receive the same reward. Do you have any advice to help me reconcile this in my mind?\n\n—Silently Struggling\n\nDear Struggling,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be honest, I found your letter a bit heartbreaking to read, particularly from the way you seem to equate “having grandchildren” as the only “reward” that matters. I hope that you haven’t communicated this sentiment to your four children directly, because it would be quite heartbreaking for them to hear that, despite having successfully cultivated independent lives of their own, you don’t seem to see much value in their happiness if grandkids aren’t involved. Maybe you don’t agree with all of the choices that your adult children have made for themselves, but if they’re happy, healthy, and enjoying their independence, that’s the kind of “reward” many, many parents would be thrilled to receive. Sure, settling down and having a family can be fulfilling, but it’s not for everyone. You should be proud that your kids are pursuing their own forms of fulfillment, and I think you should consider the possibility that your resentment over this grandkids situation may be affecting your relationships with them, however subconsciously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sympathetic to your pain. It’s clear that having grandchildren is important to you, and that you are mourning the fact that you may not get to experience that part of life. Rather than taking this resentment out on your children (or your half-sister—more on that in a second), I would encourage you to find an outlet for some of the energy behind this desire. If you’re wanting to spend time with kids, you might consider volunteering or simply being more involved with the children within your own social circles as a de facto great-aunt or god-mother. But if it’s a matter of keeping busy and feeling fulfilled yourself, I suggest throwing yourself into hobbies, a cause or two that you care about, or your friendships. Your future might look different than you imagined, but it can still be a very full one. Perhaps speaking to a professional therapist will also help you deal with the grief for this imagined other life, and help you find acceptance for the one you do have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a therapist could also help you unpack some of those feelings your harboring toward your half-sister. I find it concerning how little empathy you seem to have for your half-sister, who sounds like she’s had a pretty chaotic and painful life. You seem to take issue with the fact that she could have made so many disagreeable choices in the past and still wind up with a fulfilling life, which you now envy. There seems to be some unresolved tension in your relationship with her, because the way you compare your situation with hers is, frankly, rather child-like. It sounds like you’re saying, “She got this, but I deserved it more!” Look, family relationships make us all batty at any age, but I would imagine that this mindset is making you miserable. Talk to someone who can provide you a good outlet for some much-needed venting—and guide you to a more peaceful state of acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

One of our regulars, an older man who knows a lot about gardening, was chatting with me and a co-worker near the register when a woman walked in. She went straight to the shelves, grabbed a seed-starting item, and headed for checkout. As she approached, the man casually asked, “Starting some seeds?” His tone was friendly. He was just making conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman barely looked at him and muttered, “Yep,” in a cold, uninterested tone. She exaggeratedly stepped around him, as if he was physically in her way, which he wasn’t at all. He was just standing there, the same as before. Still, he didn’t seem offended and followed up with, “Can I give you some advice?” Again, his tone was polite, and given his knowledge, I figured he probably had something useful to share. But the woman cut him off with a sharp, “No, thank you,” her voice clipped and dismissive, like she couldn’t believe he dared to speak to her. The man looked surprised but just said, “Oh, OK,” and didn’t press the issue. After that, the whole store went awkwardly silent. I rang her up quickly, and she left without another word, clearly irritated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that not everyone wants unsolicited advice, but he wasn’t pushy or rude. He was just being friendly, and she acted like he was harassing her. It was so unnecessarily hostile that I felt bad for him. At the same time, I didn’t know if I should have said anything—maybe lightened the mood or reassured him afterward. Should I have stepped in somehow? If so, what would have been the right way to handle it?\n\n—Unsure and Uneasy\n\nDear Unsure,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t think it would have been helpful for you to step in while this interaction was happening; whatever was going on with this customer, I doubt she would have welcomed feeling like the staff was ganging up on her. Unfortunately, rude customers are just one of life’s reliable annoyances, and there isn’t much to be done about them.\n\nHowever, I do think you could have said something to your regular, who probably felt embarrassed by the exchange. He may have wondered if he did something wrong, and it would have been kind of you (or anyone else on staff) to reaffirm his read of the situation—i.e., that this customer was frosty and weird, and that you didn’t like how she treated him. People generally just want their experiences validated; it’s like walking by when someone trips and asking if they’re hurt. You’re not asking because you’re a medical professional or because they’re actually physically harmed; it’s just a way of saying, “I saw what happened, and I care that you’re OK.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a devoted runner and my girlfriend constantly asks me to run with her, but she’s just too slow. Would asking her to find someone else to run with be rude?\n\n—Not Interested in a Snail’s Pace\n\nDear Not Interested,\n\nIt depends on your girlfriend’s motives. If she’s asking to go for a run together because she wants to bond with you over your favorite activity, then yes, it would be quite rude to tell her outright that she’s too slow for you. You will need to come up with some creative solutions—maybe you could do your usual 10 miles first, and then do a victory lap with her at a slower pace. Or you can propose an alternative activity that shows you appreciate her need for spending time together, and want to bond with her too.\n\nBut if your girlfriend is just trying to get more into running herself, I think you can be slightly more honest. Tell her that you’re a little weird and intense about your personal running routine, but that if it’s important to her, you’d be happy to set aside a morning or two in the coming months for a jogging date. Don’t make this an issue about her speed though; just claim that you’re very particular and set in your ways when it concerns running in a way that simply won’t be fun for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy friends Lucy and Olive have met a few times over the years. A few weeks ago, I hosted a party where they saw each other for the first time in a long time. I recently discovered that Lucy shared her struggle to find a job, so Olive recommended her for a one-year contract position at her workplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re all in our mid-20s. Olive is killing it at her corporate job. She was recently promoted and oversees a small team. Lucy’s more of a free spirit. She’s had a few short-term jobs since graduating college. She lives with her parents and travels abroad a lot, but I know she’s pretty unhappy and feels down about struggling to land a full-time job.\n\nLucy told me the biggest downside of this job is the really long contract term (her words, not mine). I expect she’ll quickly ask for time off to travel and won’t complete the full year, as she’s done this with previous jobs. I love my friend, but I know work isn’t her priority. And I worry it will reflect poorly on Olive, who really cares about her job. Should I give Olive a heads-up about what I know? Have a conversation with Lucy before she accepts the job? Or should I just stay out of it?\n\n—Concerned Friend\n\nDear Concerned,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would stay out of it. Any attempts to fill in either Olive or Lucy about what you know—or what you think you know about Lucy’s intentions and Olive’s professional standing—about this potential employment situation could easily backfire. Then you’ll be the one to blame. Olive and Lucy are grown-ups who can handle their careers on their own. Give Olive’s company some credit, too, for being able to suss out what they may need to suss out, should Lucy undergo the interview process. There are professionals and processes in place for figuring out if Lucy is a good match for the role; you absolutely not need to involve yourself personally.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nFor the last year ,I’ve been attending a weightlifting class three times a week, with a rotating group of about 20 regulars. It’s mostly women but a few men attend too who really gel with everyone. It’s a really positive class and everyone chats before and after and cheers each other on during class. Everyone always says it’s the people who keep them coming back, including me!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe slight issue is that about every other month, we try to go out for a happy hour or something after our workout. While the concept of, “Hey anyone up for some beers on a patio right now?” after lifting sounds great, in reality, it just isn’t fun. There are a few people in the group who honestly just talk too much (including our otherwise beloved instructor) and are constantly doing this strange thing of trying to outdo each other with sardonic anecdotes about dating, their families, etc. I imagine this is a common workplace scenario but I’ve been self-employed for so long that I’m out of practice on how to avoid irritating people to connect with the ones I like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn’t the most serious issue, but do you have any thoughts on how to shift the tide of a group conversation when one or two people keep taking over others? There’s not anyone specifically I’m interested in seeing one-on-one but I do really care about the group dynamic as I spend more time with these people than most of my close friends!\n\n—Tired of the Monologuing\n\nDear Tired,\n\nI think there is a certain level of acceptance—or maybe it’s something more like tolerance—that you will have to build back up for these kinds of annoying conversational inevitabilities, especially if it’s once a month. Group dynamics are particularly difficult when the group is just small enough where people can’t really break out into individual sidebars of their choosing, and it feels like everyone is held hostage to listen to the dominant personalities.\n\nYou could try to socially engineer a situation where there’s a bit more mixing by suggesting a bar where people can’t all sit down at one large table or where there’s a secondary activity (like cornhole or bocce ball, for example) going on. But you might also have to get comfortable jumping in between these monologues yourself. “Wait, I have a question for the group…” is a great way to pivot the conversation; I’m sure the other members of your group will be relieved to have a change in topic.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy husband has a gay friend from high school. As an adult, before we married, he traveled to see his friend and for a week hung out with him and other gay men.

        "content": "This article contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of Severance, “Cold Harbor.”\n\nThe innies are running the asylum. The finale of Severance’s second season gave most of us what we wanted—a reunion of outie Mark Scout (Adam Scott) with his imprisoned and once-thought-dead wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman)—and then ripped it away with a twist that was both brutal and, perhaps in retrospect, inevitable. After finally managing to talk to each other via camcorder, Mark’s innie and outie work together to bust Gemma out of Lumon Industries’ testing floor and severed floor, two areas where her brain snaps into different consciousnesses with no knowledge of the other. Gemma reaches an exit stairwell where she inhabits her regular, outie brain, but Mark’s innie decides he’d rather not effectively kill himself by going with her.\n\nInstead, innie Mark runs back into the arms of Helly (Britt Lower), the severed version of Lumon scion Helena Eagan. They head back into the recesses of the severed floor, where a bunch of severed marching-band employees are holding cowed severed-floor overseer Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) hostage. Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), Milchick’s predecessor before she turned on Lumon, began this season by telling Mark’s outie that there would be “no honeymoon ending” for him and the missing Gemma. She ended it by telling Mark’s innie that there’d be none of that with Helly, either. We’ve learned that innies are just as stubborn as their outies about giving up a shot at a future with the only person they love.\n\nApple hasn’t told us yet that we’re getting a third season of Severance, but it feels like only a matter of time, because this show is having a cultural moment that transcends Apple TV+’s otherwise tiny place in the streaming ecosystem. Much of the enthusiasm comes in the form of fan theories, and we learned in the season finale that some of the internet’s most popular hypotheses were bang-on, while others were way off. And while the finale had no shortage of infodumps, we ultimately learned almost nothing about the fates of our characters, save for dead Lumon security boss Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), who learned the hard way what happens when an innie’s finger is on the trigger as he snaps into his outie’s consciousness while riding a Lumon elevator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere are we, then? Here’s where various fan theories and open questions stand after “Cold Harbor.”\n\nWhat were all those numbers on Mark’s computer?\n\nThey were little pieces of Gemma’s consciousness. “The building blocks of her mind,” as Cobel told Mark’s innie.\n\nA lot of amateur theorists had pegged this one from the first episode of the season (or even before), when the show flashed a black-and-white picture of Gemma, looking like a testing subject, as Mark and his fellow macrodata refiners dragged numbers into boxes. We still don’t know exactly what makes numbers correspond to the categories Mark gave them, but we do know what those categories are: Mark was sorting them to correspond to Lumon cult founder Kier Eagan’s “Four Tempers” of woe, frolic, dread, and malice, which seems to be Lumon-speak for what are sometimes thought to be the four basic emotions: sadness, happiness, fear, and anger. Over his two years at Lumon, Mark has now reconstructed 25 different versions of Gemma’s mind, each representing its own innie when Gemma steps into a different testing room.\n\nWhat is Cold Harbor?\n\nThe final test of the 25 that Lumon has now run on Gemma. We saw some of the previous tests in Episode 7 of this season, when Gemma’s different innies were living life in an endless loop of dentist appointments, violently turbulent flights, and traumatic Christmas-card writing. I theorized then that Lumon was using Gemma to test consumer applications of the severance procedure, which could unburden people from the memories of painful or unpleasant moments. I still feel good about that theory after seeing what Lumon did to Gemma’s innie in “Cold Harbor,” the final test. The company had her disassemble a crib, calling back to her memory from Episode 7 of Mark taking apart a crib after Gemma miscarried during their marriage. (Lumon also played Billie Holiday’s take on “I’ll Be Seeing You,” a favorite of Mark and Gemma in their outie existence.) The couple’s fertility struggles set Gemma on the road to Lumon in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe severance barriers held even as Lumon put Gemma’s new innie through the most emotionally torturous test possible. Or at least they were holding, until Mark burst in. The Cold Harbor version of Gemma didn’t know who Mark’s outie was, and she initially threatened him with a piece of the crib, but she seemed to realize after a few seconds that Mark was at least a trustworthy person. Was this a case of love overpowering severance? Maybe! Once Gemma snapped into her outie self in the testing floor hallway, she and Mark finally had their moment back together in their own heads. It was sadly short.\n\nWhat makes Gemma’s case different from the standard severance procedure? Didn’t Mark’s severance also free him from his grief when he thought Gemma was dead?\n\nThe simple answer is that Gemma is being severed a lot. Mark has one innie, but Gemma has 25. Lumon may find both commercial and spiritual value in learning how to split a person’s brain into 25 different consciousnesses. With one innie, Lumon can free someone from the pain of work, or of birthing a child, but with as many as 25, Lumon may be able to achieve what seems to have been its ultimate goal since its days making ether: freedom from all pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does Lumon have an indoor goat pasture on the severed floor?\n\nCobel had informed Mark’s outie in the previous episode that Gemma would die when Mark’s innie finished his Cold Harbor data refinement. We learned in the finale that not only was Lumon likely to slaughter Gemma once it was done with this last test but also—in perhaps a twist on Judeo-Christian tradition—a cute little goat.\n\nBack in the third episode of the season, we met Lush, the severed goat farmer played by Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie, a member of the Lumon department known as Mammalians Nurturable, and one of the most baffling questions since the show’s first season has been “What’s up with the goats?” We’ve now learned that the company has a dark, sacred vision for the goats. Lumon’s plan, Drummond tells Lush, is that Lumon will ceremonially sacrifice the goat and then “this beast will be entombed with a cherished woman whose spirit it must guide to Kier’s door.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the show may have begun to tell us what’s up with the goats, there are still questions. Recall that Lush asks Drummond, “How many more must I give?,” and earlier in the season, when Helena meets Mark’s outie, she mistakes Gemma’s name as “Hannah.” How many women has Lumon kidnapped and held for testing? How many goats has it slaughtered with them?\n\nWhy did Lumon’s CEO secretly father countless children?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eagans are wildly creepy people, but it felt gross even by their standards to learn at the end of Episode 9 that current (and elderly) Lumon chief executive Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry) is a serial fatherer of new babies. “She’s one of Jame’s,” Cobel tells a security guard at the company’s severed birthing retreat, using the line to sneak outie Mark’s sister, Devon, into the facility with her.\n\nIt turns out that Jame believes his existing children, Helena included, are all disappointments. They do not remind him of Kier. But Helly, the innie version of his daughter, has the founder’s fire. Helly, the innie, now seems to be Jame’s pick to succeed him as the boss of the company. Not sure how that would work! Helly certainly would not want it anyway.\n\nWhat did Jame Eagan mean when he said that Helly had tricked him?\n\nIt was a popular theory over the past week that Helly, the innie, had somehow escaped Lumon’s severed floor for a second time and was cosplaying as her outie to sabotage Lumon from headquarters. Nope. When Jame entered the severed floor at the end of Episode 9 and told Helly, “You tricked me,” he was just referring to the end of Season 1, when Helly pretended to be her outie and then gave a speech at a Lumon gala about the company’s abuse of the innies. There was no fresh meat on that bone.\n\nIs Seth Milchick a company man or part of the resistance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll season, Severance has seemed to lay the groundwork for Milchick to turn against Lumon and become an ally of Mark and the other innies. Early on in the season, the company gifts Milchick a painting of the very much not-Black founder, Kier, only with Black skin, so that Milchick can “see himself” in the tradition of the company. Milchick is visibly uncomfortable. Drummond castigates Milchick for using an elegant vocabulary, something Milchick might not be doing in the first place if not for his need to make a name for himself at an almost all-white company. The security boss blames Milchick for failures that aren’t his fault, and by Episode 9, Milchick has had enough, telling Drummond to “devour feculence.” In the finale, during a ridiculous company skit involving an animatronic statue of the founder, Milchick breaks character and notes that the real Kier was five inches shorter than the one that’s been wheeled onto the severed floor.\n\nRelated From Slate Severance​ Nails One Particularly Fraught Aspect of the Workplace Read More\n\nAnd yet. Milchick not only does nothing to help Mark bust out Gemma but tries hard to get in his way. For Milchick, the season ends in purgatory. Lumon is poised to punish him for letting Gemma get away, but the company might not even get the chance, because a bunch of severed marching-band musicians are holding Milchick hostage in MDR. Your employer doesn’t see you as family, Seth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about the oft-theorized Lumon plan to build a whole severed workforce?\n\nA common fan theory holds that Lumon wants an army of severed workers, maybe ones who never leave the building and thus don’t even have outies. In this episode, we meet the marching band from Choreography and Merriment, a department we haven’t seen before. There are dozens of musicians in this band, and they comport themselves more or less like robots, not deviating from their act or acknowledging others’ speech until Helly and Dylan (Zach Cherry) convince them to stop their song and assist in the hostage-taking of Milchick. Maybe Lumon has more severed workers than we thought.\n\nIs full reintegration even possible? And is Mark still pursuing it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo idea. We haven’t seen Reghabi (Karen Aldridge), the former Lumon doctor who was helping to merge Mark’s two minds, since she had a falling-out with Devon in Episode 7. (Mark’s sis was not happy about the unsanctioned brain surgery the doctor was doing on her brother.) Mark ends the season not fully reintegrated, though he and his innie have started to see little glimpses of each other’s lives. Some of the questions that innie Mark asks outie Mark about reintegration also seem like awfully good ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs someone in outie Mark’s family spying on him for Lumon?\n\nProbably not. Lots of Severance fans are under the impression that Mark’s brother-in-law, Ricken—or maybe even his sister, Devon—is a Lumon mole keeping tabs on his outie. We get no whiff of that from Devon in the finale, as she helped plan what amounted to a second Macrodat Uprising, and Ricken was absent (save for flashbacks to Mark and Gemma’s old life) from the final few episodes of the season. Not every theory about this show will be a winner.\n\nWhere have you gone, Irving?\n\nIrving B. (John Turturro) has spent years trying to merge the memories of his innie and outie, and both versions of him have been among the most rebellious fighters against Lumon. The company knows what Irving is up to, and in Episode 9 of the season, Jame Eagan tells Helena, “We’re seeing to Mr. Bailiff.” Excitement about finally learning Irving’s last name aside, he was the target of a Lumon manhunt. The company likely would have killed him, but Irving’s innie love interest, Burt (Christopher Walken), drives him to a train station and sends him away. Burt is a low-level Lumon enforcer of some kind, but he feels an attachment to Irving on the outside as well as the inside. We see neither of them in the finale, and I’m not sure if we ever will again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does the final shot of the season look exactly how it does?\n\nThe most heart-wrenching moment of the second season is its last. Innie Mark and Helly leave outie Gemma sobbing in an exit stairwell, rescued from Lumon’s torture but abandoned on the outside because innie Mark has decided to stay inside with the love of his tortured life, Helly. If Gemma can get all the way outside of Lumon’s office complex, she’ll be physically free after two years as a lab rat, but she’ll be alone in the same way her husband was when he thought she had died in a car crash. Plus, there’s always the threat that Lumon could “see to” her.\n\nWhat happens after Mark and Helly turn away from the exit caught my eye. The two characters are almost skipping down the hallways of the severed floor, laughing and holding hands. I might even call their movements frolicking. But in the episode’s closing seconds, two things happen. First, Mark and Helly’s smiles begin to fade. As with the runaway lovers in the famous final moments of The Graduate, it all dissolves to closing credits (and some very 1960s-styled credits at that) just as doubts seem to set in. (What is Lumon going to do to them now that they’ve led a second revolt and Mark has killed a high-level Lumon employee? Does Lumon even have any more use for them now that Cold Harbor is complete?) Second, the screen fades out to red, a color that, many have theorized, Severance typically uses to represent the outside world. I don’t think that color choice was merely because Mark was covered in Drummond’s blood. What is Severance telling us when it cuts from two innies to a red screen?\n\nAre you really going to spend the next year or two (or, Kier forbid, three) overanalyzing what it means that Severance chose to fade to red instead of black to end the second season?\n\nWell, this is Severance, so yes.",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOver the past five days, the Trump administration has put on a master class in how to piss off Chief Justice John Roberts. Its behavior in the Alien Enemies Act case seems designed to rankle the chief in every conceivable way: Rather than win the case on the merits, the administration has launched a multilevel assault on the presiding judge, James Boasberg. It isn’t just that Donald Trump, along with his co-President Elon Musk, has called for Boasberg’s impeachment—though that escalation did prompt Roberts to issue a rare rejoinder. It’s that the Justice Department, too, has gotten in on the action, insulting Boasberg in insolent filings that openly question his integrity, neutrality, and competence. In short, the administration is deliberately staking this out as a battle between the executive branch and the judicial branch.\n\nThere is surely some considered tactic at play here. The tactic simply appears not to be “Winning John Roberts’ vote.” Rather, the Trump administration seems eager to prevail in the court of public opinion, then leverage that victory to make the courts fall in line—the same play it’s running on Congress. The public-facing side of this strategy is obvious enough. First, the administration raced to deport Venezuelan migrants whom it accused, without evidence, of membership in the Tren de Aragua gang. Then it invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to argue that courts had no authority to stop the operation. When Boasberg ordered a halt to it nonetheless, high-ranking Trump officials bashed him in the media, while Trump and Musk called for his impeachment. House Republicans have now introduced articles of impeachment against the judge, and Musk is encouraging the effort by donating money to lawmakers who support it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn court, the administration’s tone is only somewhat less contemptuous. The DOJ evidently defied Boasberg on Saturday, when he ordered the return of planes carrying migrants to El Salvador; rather than comply with his directive, the government let two planes continue to their destination and allowed a third to take off well after the order. When Boasberg called a hearing to probe this disobedience, the Justice Department responded with a blast of impudent fury. First, government lawyers told him he had no power to issue the order in the first place, implicitly justifying the administration’s defiance. Second, they told him his order didn’t count anyway because it had been delivered from the bench (a claim that is absurd). Third, they tried (and failed) to postpone the hearing, warning that they would refuse to provide him with key information if summoned to court. Fourth, they asked a higher court to take away the case from Boasberg, accusing him of engaging in “highly unusual and improper procedures.” (A request for reassignment is typically considered the nuclear option in federal court, a last resort only after a judge has engaged in indefensible, intransigent misbehavior.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoasberg held the hearing anyway—and, as it had promised, the DOJ declined to answer questions about its own alleged defiance of his order. The judge then ordered the government lawyers to answer his questions while allowing them to do so under seal to avoid the public disclosure of sensitive information. The DOJ, though, was not placated: Instead, it filed a shockingly nasty protest filled with angry jabs at Boasberg. It dismissed the kerfuffle as “a picayune dispute over the micromanagement of immaterial factfinding” and accused Boasberg of lacking sufficient “respect” for the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The court,” the lawyers wrote, “has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government’s flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts” before ruling for the migrants. (In reality, this information is largely public already, because the White House shared many details of the operation while boasting about the deportation flights.) Boasberg, they continued, was seeking “to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the government legally immaterial facts,” including “state secrets.” (The relevant facts are not “legally immaterial”—they could show whether the government broke the law!) The filing called on Boasberg to end his “unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions” and asked him to freeze proceedings while they begged an appeals court to bail them out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a rule, attorneys do not communicate with judges like this. Attorneys representing the United States certainly do not write this way. Boasberg could have raised the prospect of sanctions immediately. Instead, in a tempered response, he reminded the Justice Department that it had never before even raised the possibility that divulging the facts around this case would reveal “state secrets.” And he pointed out that the DOJ had not even previously noted that the relevant information was classified. In an act of grace, he nonetheless gave the government’s lawyers a 24-hour extension and reminded them that they have to actually invoke the state-secrets privilege if they want to rely upon it. The lawyers, however, wound up regurgitating details they had already provided, a response Boasberg dismissed as “woefully insufficient.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Trump Decided to Engineer a Constitutional Crisis Now Read More\n\nThe DOJ’s crude treatment of Boasberg sends the unmistakable message that he is a rogue judge who needs to be reined in by a tough president and, ideally, a congressional impeachment. Attorney General Pam Bondi made her agency’s position clear on Wednesday, when she accused the judge of “meddling in our government.” Why, she asked, is Boasberg “trying to protect terrorists who invaded our country over American citizens?” (Again, there is no evidence these people are terrorists.) The thrust of her comments, echoed in DOJ filings, is that Boasberg is so biased and reckless that he cannot be trusted to oversee a case with such sensitive implications for national security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne person who would disagree with such claims about Boasberg is John Roberts. The chief justice himself appointed Boasberg to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as presiding judge; in that position, he regularly reviewed, and ruled upon, extraordinarily sensitive requests by intelligence agencies to surveil communications between suspected spies and foreign powers. The surveillance court’s work is shrouded in secrecy, and even the smallest public disclosure could jeopardize vital intelligence operations. And Roberts appointed Boasberg to lead it. He also appointed Boasberg as chief judge of the U.S. Alien Terrorist Removal Court, where he would hear similarly sensitive information to determine if terrorists should be deported. (The court has never conducted proceedings.) It’s notable, too, that George W. Bush appointed both Roberts and Boasberg to the bench. (Barack Obama later elevated Boasberg to his current position.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, Roberts has deep trust and respect for Boasberg. Why else would he handpick the judge to serve on these specialized courts? (Boasberg also has a connection to Justice Brett Kavanaugh: The two were roommates at Yale Law School.) Several of Boasberg’s clerks have also gone on to clerk for Roberts, yet another indication that the chief justice respects his judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s true that Roberts’ statement in Boasberg’s defense was not exactly impassioned. (In fact, it was just two sentences: “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” he wrote. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”) But the substance matters less than the mere existence of an intervention by the chief, who rarely speaks out publicly about any topic. He makes the very occasional exception to defend judges under fire, as he did during Trump’s first term. And the fact that he stepped into the fray to defend Boasberg is proof in itself that the administration has made a misstep. Moreover, a defining feature of Roberts’ jurisprudence is his intolerance for bad lawyering. His past votes against Trump reflect an aversion to sloppy and dishonest legal arguments, and he does not take kindly to insulting, patronizing, or underhanded reasoning. Yet that is exactly how the Justice Department has approached Boasberg in this case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two possible explanations for this strange conduct. The first is that the administration does not care about alienating Roberts and believes that it can coerce him into compliance with its agenda through public pressure. The second is more alarming: that if Roberts does start siding against Trump—if the Supreme Court blocks his agenda—it plans to also ignore those rulings and is laying the groundwork for that defiance now. The ongoing refusal to comply with Boasberg’s order may well be a blueprint for future disobedience on a bigger scale. If that is what lies ahead, then the chief justice was wise to step in early. But he will need to do a great deal more than issue a bone-dry statement to the press.",
